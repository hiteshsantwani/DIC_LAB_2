There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.\nMerkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\\'t think that is the right solution. He said \"the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available.\"\nAndres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a \"false solution.\"",
