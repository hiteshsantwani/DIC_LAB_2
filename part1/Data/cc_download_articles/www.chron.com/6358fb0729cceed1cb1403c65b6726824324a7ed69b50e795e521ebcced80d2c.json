Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.\nThe French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.\n___\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",
