Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU on Friday.\n___\n9:30 a.m.\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk is meeting leaders including British Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of an emergency summit to decide whether to grant the United Kingdom a further delay in its departure from the European Union.\nDonald Tusk meets the leaders of Lithuania, Latvia, The Netherlands and finally May shortly before Wednesday evening\\'s summit begins.\nIt\\'s likely to be a rough day for the embattled British leader as she pleads for a second extension until June 30, to prevent Britain\\'s departure now scheduled for Friday.\nTusk has suggested an even longer delay of up to a year with conditions attached to ensure Britain does not stymie EU decision making if it remains a member.\nEU countries have become increasingly exasperated with the political division and uncertainty in Britain.",
