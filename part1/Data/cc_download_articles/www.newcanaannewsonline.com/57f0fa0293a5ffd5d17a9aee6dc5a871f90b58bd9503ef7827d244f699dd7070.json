They included 185,377 violent crimes, a 1.9 percent decrease from the year before.\nDespite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.\nThe overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent.
