The project includes upgrading infrastructure to create a network of transport and trade links between Asia and Europe.\nBeijing has created a $3-billion fund and announced a $10-billion credit line for the 16 countries in the region.\nAt the start of the plenary meeting, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said that over a relatively short time, the initiative \"has resulted in the establishment of new ties and projects\" also becoming a platform for \"intense and substantial political dialogue\" between the participating states.\nHe also announced that Greece will join the coalition. The vision is to have the Chinese-controlled Greek port of Piraeus become an entry point for Chinese goods to Europe by linking it to railroads and highways that are also part of China\\'s investments.",
