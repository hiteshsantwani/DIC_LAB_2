    "text": "ROME, April 5 (Reuters) - Italy plans to gradually reduce individual income tax rates from five to two and to set a company tax rate at 20 percent, according to a draft National Reform Programme seen by Reuters.\nThe government will set the tax rates at 15 and 20 percent for all tax-payers, with the lower rate reserved for incomes of below 30,000 euros ($33,648.00) per year.\nThere are currently five tax rates, ranging from 23 percent to 43 percent.\nThe tax reform will potentially drive up Italy\\'s budget deficit unless it is compensated by cuts to public spending.\nThe company tax rate (IRES), which is currently at 24 percent, will decline to 20 percent.\nThe National Reform Programme is part of a forecasting document (DEF), which European Union member States must send every April to Brussels. Italy is due to present its DEF, which will set the framework for the 2020 budget, on April 9.\nThe National Reform Programme also pledges to create a national bank for investments backed by a state guarantee.
