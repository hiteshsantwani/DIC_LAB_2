    "text": "PARIS, April 2 (Reuters) - Investment company Searchlight Capital Partners has agreed to buy a 26 percent stake in French aeronautics company Latecoere for around $106.8 million, in the latest example of activist funds targeting French companies.\nSearchlight Capital said it would buy the stakes in Latecoere held by Apollo Capital Management, Monarch Alternative Capital and CVI Partners, at a price of 3.85 euros per share.\nLatecoere shares closed at 3.13 euros on April 1, giving the company a market capitalisation of around 300 million euros ($336 million).\nLatecoere had cut its earnings outlook last December after start-up costs related to new contracts hit its margins and cash flow, although the company\\'s latest set of results earlier this month showed signs of a recovery.\nLatecoere said it welcomed Searchlight\\'s move and Searchlight\\'s presence on its board of directors.\n\"The company welcomes this proposed transaction, Searchlight having shown on this occasion its support for the strategy proposed by management and approved by the board of directors and confirms that Searchlight will propose three candidates to be approved by the board of Directors to join the board of directors,\" Latecoere said in a statement.\n($1 = 0.8926 euros) (Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Rashmi Aich)",
