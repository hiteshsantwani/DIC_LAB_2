Services again drove the economy, with a continued strong performance in IT.\n\\'Manufacturing also continued to recover after weakness at the end of last year with the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry, chemicals and alcohol performing well in recent months.\\'\nThe ONS cited data that showed a surge in manufacturing output in March was linked to manufacturers and firms hoarding goods in the run-up to what was supposed to be Brexit.\nCompanies stepped up production to build inventories in advance of March 29, Britain\\'s original Brexit day, before the Conservative Government asked the EU for an extension.",
