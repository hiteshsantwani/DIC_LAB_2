    "text": "PARIS, April 2 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron urged Britain on Tuesday to come up with a plan to break the Brexit deadlock before a summit in Brussels next week, or risk slipping automatically towards a disorderly exit from the European Union.\n\"If the United Kingdom is not capable, almost three years after the referendum, of coming forward with a solution that is supported by a majority, it will have effectively chosen a no-deal exit on its own,\" Macron said.\nSpeaking ahead of talks with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, Macron said whether that alternative plan involved a snap election, a referendum or a customs union was for Britain to decide.\n\"It\\'s up to London to say it, and to say it now,\" he said.
