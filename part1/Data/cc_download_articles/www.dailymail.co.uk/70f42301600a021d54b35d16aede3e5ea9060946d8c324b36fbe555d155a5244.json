It\\'s not a disease,\" Ibrahim told The Associated Press in an interview. \"Migration is about aspirations, not desperation. People who migrate are mostly capable, ambitious young people who are migrating to work and to build successful lives. They add wealth to the countries they go to.\"\nIbrahim also cited statistics to rebut anti-migration politicians who say Africans have inundated Europe.\n\"Europe is not being flooded by Africans,\" Ibrahim said, citing statistics that show 70% of African migrants relocate within Africa.\nThe 72-year-old philanthropist earned his fortune by establishing the Celtel mobile phone network across Africa.\nFILE - In this Wednesday May 6, 2015 file photo, Mo Ibrahim, Founder and Chairman of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, speaks at the Clinton Global Initiative Middle East & Africa meeting in Marrakech, Morocco.
