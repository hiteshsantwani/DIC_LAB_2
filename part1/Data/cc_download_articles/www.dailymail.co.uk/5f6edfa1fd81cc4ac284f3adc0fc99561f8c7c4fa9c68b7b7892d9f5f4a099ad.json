    "text": "BERLIN (AP) - Chancellor Angela Merkel has received former U.S. President Barack Obama at her office in Berlin for a meeting characterized by German officials as a routine private encounter with a former international peer.\nObama could be seen waving as he left the chancellery alongside Merkel Friday. Merkel\\'s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she has met repeatedly with ex-heads of state and government \"with whom she worked together closely and well for a time.\"\nHe said the meeting has no implications for current German-U.S. relations. Asked whether it was a signal to President Donald Trump, with whom Germany has a sometimes-complicated relationship, Seibert replied: \"I would firmly reject that impression.\"\nMerkel and Obama have already met in Berlin since the former president left office, participating in a discussion at a May 2017 conference.\nFormer US President Barack Obama, right, waves as he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, left, leave the Chancellery after a meetin in Berlin, Germany, Friday, April 5, 2019.
