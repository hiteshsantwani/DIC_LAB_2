    "text": "BRUSSELS (AP) - The Latest on Britain\\'s exit from the European Union (all times local):\n12:45 p.m.\nThe European Union\\'s legislature has warned British Prime Minister Theresa May to come to the Brexit summit with clear indications on how she hopes to turn the cross-party talks with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn into a success.\nThe European Parliament said in a statement Wednesday that May \"cannot come empty-handed.\"\nAnd the legislators told the EU leaders that they have to make sure that Britain will not become obstructionist if a long extension to their departure is granted.\nThey said the summit \"would be advised to provide the U.K. with an extension which should be appropriately framed to respect the principle of sincere cooperation.\"\nBritain\\'s Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street to attend the weekly session of Prime Ministers Questions at the House of Commons, in London, Wednesday, April 10, 2019. Just days away from a potentially calamitous no-deal Brexit, European Union leaders meet Wednesday to discuss granting the United Kingdom a new delay - possibly of up to a year - to its departure from the bloc. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth)\nThe European Parliament will need to approve any deal May reaches with the EU to make it binding.\n___\n11:35 a.m.\nGroups representing manufacturers in the U.K. and across the continent have appealed to European leaders to work with Britain to avoid a divorce from the bloc without a deal.\nMake UK and sister organization Ceemet issued a joint letter to heads of state and chief negotiator Michel Barnier warning of economic shock in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\nThe groups say that while they recognize efforts have been made to address the chaos that a no-deal scenario would cause, \"it must be clear that neither the EU nor the UK are ready, and as a consequence European industry is also not adequately prepared, for this cliff edge scenario.\"\nPrime Minister Theresa May travels to Brussels Wednesday to ask for another extension to Britain\\'s departure, until June 30. Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU on Friday.\n___\n9:30 a.m.\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk is meeting leaders including British Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of an emergency summit to decide whether to grant the United Kingdom a further delay in its departure from the European Union.\nDonald Tusk meets the leaders of Lithuania, Latvia, The Netherlands and finally May shortly before Wednesday evening\\'s summit begins.\nIt\\'s likely to be a rough day for the embattled British leader as she pleads for a second extension until June 30, to prevent Britain\\'s departure now scheduled for Friday.\nTusk has suggested an even longer delay of up to a year with conditions attached to ensure Britain does not stymie EU decision making if it remains a member.\nEU countries have become increasingly exasperated with the political division and uncertainty in Britain.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron,left, greets British Prime Minister Theresa May before a meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris Tuesday, April 9, 2019. A top official at the French presidency says France doesn\\'t rule out granting a further delay to Brexit, just before a planned meeting between Prime minister Theresa May and President Emmanuel Macron in Paris.
