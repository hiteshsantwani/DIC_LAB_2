    "text": "NEW YORK, April 2 (Reuters) - The foreign ministers of Germany and France called for more clarity from London on Tuesday after British Prime Minister Theresa May said she would seek a further delay to Britain\\'s withdrawal from the European Union.\n\"I\\'m tempted to say let us know if something changes,\" said France\\'s Jean-Yves Le Drian at a joint press conference the two held in New York. \"Three years after their decision, the British must come up with a clear line because otherwise, sadly, it\\'ll be a hard Brexit in coming days.\"\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas declined to comment on the request for an extension but urged London to move swiftly: \"That we\\'re long past five after midnight - they must know that in London, too.\" (Reporting by Michelle Nichols in New York, writing by Thomas Escritt Editing by Gareth Jones)",
