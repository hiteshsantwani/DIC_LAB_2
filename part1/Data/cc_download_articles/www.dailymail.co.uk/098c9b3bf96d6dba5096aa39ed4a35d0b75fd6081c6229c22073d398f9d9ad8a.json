The other towers were designed by Daniel Libeskind and Arata Isozaki.\nHadid\\'s tower twists as it rises, with the upper floors facing Milan\\'s centerpiece Duomo cathedral in the center of the city.\nGenerali chairman Gabriele Galateri called the tower \"a true element of development for Milan,\" with a focus on sustainability.\nA view of the Generali tower skyscraper, designed by architect and designer Zaha Hadid, which was officially inaugurated in Milan, Italy, Tuesday, April 9, 2019.
