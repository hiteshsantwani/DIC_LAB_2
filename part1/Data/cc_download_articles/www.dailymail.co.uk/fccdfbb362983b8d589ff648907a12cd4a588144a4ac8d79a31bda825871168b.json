    "text": "Ilkay Gundogan believes Manchester City are too nervous and making too many mistakes in the Champions League.\nThe City midfielder feels City were guilty of trying too hard as they were beaten 1-0 in the first leg of their quarter-final against Tottenham on Tuesday.\nThe Premier League champions were undone by a late Son Heung-min goal at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, leaving them with a deficit to overturn in next week\\'s return leg.\nIlkay Gundogan believes Manchester City are too nervous in big Champions League matches\nAfter exits in the last 16 and quarter-finals in the past two seasons, transferring domestic dominance on to the European stage remains a challenge for City under Pep Guardiola.\nGundogan told Sky Deutschland: \\'We were not brave enough in the game and we made a lot of simple mistakes.\n\\'I have the feeling we are nervous in important Champions League games. We always make the wrong decisions.\n\\'In these matches we always want to do something special because it means (going through to the) Champions League semi-finals. Sometimes less is more.\\'\nGundogan believes City reacted badly to an early penalty miss by Sergio Aguero.\nThe Premier League champions were undone by a late Son Heung-min goal against Tottenham\nThe Argentinian was denied by Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris after City were awarded a controversial spot-kick when Danny Rose was adjudged to have handled in the box.\nGundogan thinks the game would have been much different had Aguero scored.\nThe 28-year-old said: \\'Negative events like that always set us back far too much.\n\\'Had we scored from the penalty we\\'d have taken Tottenham apart.\n\\'But instead we withdrew from the game. That must not happen to a big team. That\\'s why we\\'re not there yet.\\'",
