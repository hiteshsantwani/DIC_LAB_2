    "text": "BERLIN (AP) - Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.\nAffordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.\nMerkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\\'t think that is the right solution. He said \"the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available.\"\nAndres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a \"false solution.\"\nProtesters attend a demonstration against rent increase in Berlin, Germany, Saturday, April 6, 2019. Slogan in the foreground reads \\'Stopp Deutsche Wohnen (housing company)\\' (AP Photo/Michael Sohn)",
