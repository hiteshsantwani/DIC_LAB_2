    "text": "PARIS, April 8 (Reuters) - Air France KLM, which has been the subject of political tensions between France and the Netherlands, on Monday reported a rise in its March passenger numbers compared with the previous year.\nThe airline said it carried a total of 8.3 million passengers in March, up 3.4 percent from a year earlier.\nHowever, Air France KLM\\'s March passenger load factor - an industry metric that measures how much of an airline\\'s passenger carrying capacity is used - dropped by 0.3 percentage points to 87.6 percent.\nIn February, the Netherlands quietly amassed a 14 percent stake in Air France KLM, almost matching the 14.3 percent held by the French state.\nThe move triggered a diplomatic spat between France and the Netherlands, although both countries have since sought to play down those tensions.
