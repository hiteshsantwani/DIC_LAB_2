    "text": "BRUSSELS (AP) - French President Emmanuel Macron\\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.\nOver a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.\nMacron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron speaks with the media as he leaves the building at the conclusion of an EU summit in Brussels, Thursday, April 11, 2019. European Union leaders on Thursday offered Britain an extension to Brexit that would allow the country to delay its EU departure date until Oct. 31.
