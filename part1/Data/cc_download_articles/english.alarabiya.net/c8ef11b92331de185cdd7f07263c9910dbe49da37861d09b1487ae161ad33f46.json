This was one of the hypothesis they prepared,\u201d Castaner said at a press conference following a meeting of G7 interior ministers in Paris.\n\u201cNo communal repatriation was under consideration to be carried out,\u201d he said, reiterating that France would nonetheless study bringing back children of extremist fighters on a \u201ccase-by-case basis.\u201d\nHe denied Liberation\u2019s claim that France\u2019s policy with regards to fighters in Syria was being dictated by public opinion.\nLast month, French authorities for the first time brought home five orphaned children of French extremists from camps in northeast Syria.\nAccording to the UN children\u2019s agency UNICEF, around 3,000 foreign children from 43 countries are housed at the al-Hol camp in Syria alone, which has taken in most of the people fleeing ISIS\u2019 self-proclaimed \u201ccaliphate\u201d in recent weeks.\nUp to 1,700 French nationals are thought to have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight with the extremists between 2014 and 2018, according to government figures. Around 300 are believed to have died in combat.\nKurdish officials have warned they do not have the resources to hold all the captured fighters indefinitely, and Washington is also urging its allies in the anti-ISIS coalition to take home their citizens.\nBut repatriation is a politically fraught issue, and governments fear they may not have enough evidence to convict ISIS members who claim they did not fight.\n\\r\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLast Update: Saturday, 6 April 2019 KSA 23:43 - GMT 20:43\\r\n\\t\\t\\t\n\\r\n\\t SHOW MORE \\r\n\\t\\t\\r\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\n\\t\\t\\r\n\\t\\r\n\\t \\r\n\\t\\t\\r\n\\t\\t\\r\n\\t",
