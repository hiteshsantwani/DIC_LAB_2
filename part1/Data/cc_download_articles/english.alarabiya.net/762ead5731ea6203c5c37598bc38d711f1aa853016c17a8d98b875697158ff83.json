The case of Shamima Begum highlighted the security, legal, and ethical dilemmas facing European governments dealing with those who swore allegiance to a group determined to destroy the West.\nGermany joined the military campaign against ISIS militants in Syria in a support role by deploying Tornado reconnaissance jets, refueling aircraft, and a frigate to the region, after an appeal from close partner France for Berlin to do more.\n\\r\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLast Update: Wednesday, 3 April 2019 KSA 21:06 - GMT 18:06\\r\n\\t\\t\\t\n\\r\n\\t SHOW MORE \\r\n\\t\\t\\r\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\n\\t\\t\\r\n\\t\\r\n\\t \\r\n\\t\\t\\r\n\\t\\t\\r\n\\t",
