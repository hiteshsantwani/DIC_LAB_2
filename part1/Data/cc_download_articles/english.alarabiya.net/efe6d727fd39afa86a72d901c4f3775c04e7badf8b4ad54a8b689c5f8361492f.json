Europe must know that they cannot shy away from their responsibilities with a few statements and some unaccomplished plans,\u201d he added.\nZarif, who was his country\u2019s chief negotiator in the negotiations leading to the deal, said that Iran would continue to pressure the Europeans to act on their obligations within the deal but added that \u201cwe never had any hopes\u201d in them.\nInstead of the western powers the Islamic republic has turned to its traditional partners such as Russia and China, Zarif said, adding \u201cthe future of our foreign policy lies in that way.\u201d\n\\r\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLast Update: Thursday, 4 April 2019 KSA 09:09 - GMT 06:09\\r\n\\t\\t\\t\n\\r\n\\t SHOW MORE \\r\n\\t\\t\\r\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\n\\t\\t\\r\n\\t\\r\n\\t \\r\n\\t\\t\\r\n\\t\\t\\r\n\\t",
