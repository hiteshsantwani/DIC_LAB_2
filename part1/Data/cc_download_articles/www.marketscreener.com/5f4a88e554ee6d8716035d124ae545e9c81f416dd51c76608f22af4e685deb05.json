    "text": "NEW YORK, April 10, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The Conference Board Leading Economic Index\u00ae (LEI) for Germany decreased 0.2 percent in February 2019 to 100.4 (2016=100).\nThe Conference Board Coincident Economic Index\u00ae (CEI) for Germany increased 0.2 percent in February 2019 to 103.7 (2016=100).\nThe composite economic indexes are the key elements in an analytic system designed to signal peaks and troughs in the business cycle. The leading and coincident economic indexes are essentially composite averages of several individual leading or coincident indicators. They are constructed to summarize and reveal common turning point patterns in economic data in a clearer and more convincing manner than any individual component \u2013 primarily because they smooth out some of the volatility of individual components.\nThe updated data tables can be found here.\nThe 2019 data release schedule is available here.\nFor more information about The Conference Board global business cycle indicators, click here.\nAbout The Conference Board\nThe Conference Board is the member-driven think tank that delivers trusted insights for what\\'s ahead.
