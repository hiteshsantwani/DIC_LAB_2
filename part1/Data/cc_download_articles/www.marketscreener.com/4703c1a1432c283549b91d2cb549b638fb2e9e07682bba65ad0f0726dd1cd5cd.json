    "text": "Luxembourg - The European Financial Stability Facility on Wednesday raised \u20ac3 billion in a new 16-year bond, leaving just \u20ac1 billion in funding needs for the remainder of the second quarter.\n\\'Today\\'s transaction met with very strong demand, as we responded to heightened investor interest in the maturity range above 10 years. The 16-year deal fills a gap in our outstanding bond tenors, and demonstrates our strategy of maintaining presence on all parts of the yield curve\\' said Siegfried Ruhl, EFSF Head of Funding and Investor Relations.\nThe spread of the 0.875% bond, which will mature on 10 April 2035, was fixed at mid swaps plus 2 basis points, for a reoffer yield of 0.951%. The order book was in excess of \u20ac11.7 billion.\nBookrunners for the deal were Barclays, BNP Paribas and DZ Bank.",
