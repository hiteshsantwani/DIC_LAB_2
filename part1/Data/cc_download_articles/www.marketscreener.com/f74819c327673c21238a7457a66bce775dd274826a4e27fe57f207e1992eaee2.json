    "text": "SHIMANO STEPS research shows the UK lags behind the rest of Europe,\nwhile the Netherlands leads the way\nSHIMANO STEPS today reveals the results of the largest European e-bike\nstudy looking at people\u2019s willingness to commute to work by e-bike. The\nindependent research* of over 12,000 people across 10 markets, reveals\nthat 24% of European commuters would consider switching to an e-bike.\nAlmost half of the population of the Netherlands (47%) would commute to\nwork by e-bike, the highest in Europe, while 39% of people in Spain and\n33% in Italy would make the switch.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here:\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190403005809/en/\nWillingness to commute to work by e-bike across Europe (Photo: Business Wire)\nRanking of countries who would consider making the switch to an e-bike\nfor their commute:\n1.\nNetherlands\n47%\n2.\nSpain\n39%\n3.\nItaly\n33%\n4.\nBelgium\n31%\n5.\nNorway\n27%\n6.\nGermany\n21%\n7.\nDenmark\n21%\n8.\nFrance\n18%\n9.\nSweden\n15%\n10.\nUnited Kingdom\n11%\nThe SHIMANO STEPS research reveals that across Europe, the main reasons\nto consider commuting to work by e-bike are \u201cto keep fit\u201d (34%) \u201cto\nprotect the environment\u201d (30%) and \u201cto save money\u201d (30%). People are put\noff riding an e-bike to work because of \u201cthe possibility of bad weather\u201d\n(37%), \u201cthe cost of an e-bike\u201d (34%) and \u201carriving to work sweaty\u201d (25%).\nPeople in the UK are the least likely to choose an e-bike to commute to\nwork, with only 11% willing to consider making the switch, well below\nthe European average. The \u201cpossibility of bad weather\u201d (43%) and\n\u201carriving to work sweaty\u201d (35%) proved to be the main reasons for the UK\npublic to resist the switch to an e-bike.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing huge growth in the e-bike market across Europe and this\nresearch highlights the likelihood of widespread adoption of e-bikes to\ncommute to work in the future,\u201d said Jeroen Van Vulpen, Brand\nManager SHIMANO STEPS. \u201cWe know that there is already a strong\ncycling culture in specific countries, where those who\\'ve made the\nswitch to an e-bike have found that bad weather is rarely an\ninsurmountable problem and sweat is a thing of the past when you let the\nelectric assistance take the strain. It\u2019s really encouraging to see that\nacross all markets, people are willing to switch to an e-bike to keep\nfit and protect the environment.\u201d\n\u201cWe welcome this research from Shimano, which confirms that there is\nhuge potential for power assisted bicycles, especially combined with the\nbuilding of longer distance cycle highways,\u201d said \u00c1d\u00e1m Bodor,\nAdvocacy Director, European Cyclists\\' Federation. \u201cThese bikes are a\ngreat addition to the bicycle family contributing to sustainable active\ntransport by being available to substitute ever longer car journeys.\u201d\n###\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n1.
