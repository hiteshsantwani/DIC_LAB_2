The fascists of CasaPound described the decision as a great victory. The fascist Forza Nuova party announced \u201ca permanent garrison until the last Roma has left\u201d.\n\\r\n\\r\nExpel\n\\r\n\\r\nIn July last year, the far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, vowed to \u201cturn words into action\u201d in his drive to expel thousands of Roma from Italy.\n\\r\n\\r\nThe number of racially motivated attacks has risen sharply, tripling between 2017 and 2018, when the racist League party entered government in coalition with M5S.\n\\r\n\\r\nMarcello Zuinisi, of the National Association of the Roma said, \u201cThe racist, fascist and Nazi squads organised in the CasaPound and Forza Nuova parties are allowed to act with impunity amid the crimes committed by government leaders.\n\\r\n\\r\n\u201cItaly is on the brink of a new abyss\u2014that of the \u2018racial laws\u2019. At a distance of 81 years from the beginning of the Holocaust the essence of humanity is still at stake.\n\\r\n\\r\n\u201cIt is necessary to defend the life of the Roma, Sinti and Caminanti threatened by barbarians and to release Italy from racism, fascism and Nazism.\u201d\n\\r\n\\r\nThere has been some opposition. \u201cI\u2019m not okay with it! No!\u201d has become popularised as a slogan after 15 year old Simone was filmed standing up to the fascists. It was the slogan of an anti-fascist demo held last Saturday in Torre Maura. It was backed by a number of NGOs and the CGIL union.\n\\r\n\\r\nThe protest saw a number of local residents voice their opposition to the fascists.\n\\t\\t\\t",
