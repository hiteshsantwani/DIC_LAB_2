    "text": "GRUNGE legend Kurt Cobain has allegedly been spotted hiding out in France \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nearly 25 years after his death.\nA number of bizarre conspiracy theories have emerged after the Nirvana frontman killed himself in Seattle, Washington, in April 1994. Many truthers are convinced the rocker was killed \u2013 but others allege he is still alive and leading a new life far from the US. Programmer Daniel Carr took a bizarre picture last month and uploaded to Twitter with the caption: \u201cKurt Cobain is alive and living in Nice, France.\u201d In it, a bloke with long blonde hair and similar facial features to Cobain is pictured leaning back on a chair in the sunshine.\nHe can also be seen wearing a leopard print coat that the singer posed with, and some of his trademark sunglasses. Back in 2017, another video surfaced that convinced some Nirvana fans Cobain was still with us. Singer Ramiro Saavedra performed hit single Come As You Are on a Peruvian talent show, with his performance going viral. With guitar in hand, Ramiro mimicked Cobain\u2019s iconic hairstyle, wore a similar cardigan, and impressed with his note-for-note performance.\nCONSPIRACIES: Other truthers are convinced the rocker was killed (Pic: GETTY)\nOne Reddit user wrote: \u201cOMG Kurt Cobain from Nirvana is alive!\u201d and another simply added: \u201cHe is alive!\u201d Others are convinced that Cobain was actually murdered, including a private investigators who was involved in the search for his body. Tom Grant was interviewed in 2015 documentary Soaked in Bleach, where he questioned the official police report that Cobain locked himself in his greenhouse before his suicide. Tom had visited the singer\\'s house after his death and took a photo that he claimed disproved that theory.",
