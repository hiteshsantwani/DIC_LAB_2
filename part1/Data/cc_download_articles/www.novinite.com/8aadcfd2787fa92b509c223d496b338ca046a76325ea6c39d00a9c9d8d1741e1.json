A similar population decline was not recorded among the omnivorous birds.\n\\xc2\\xa0\nThe study also shows that the populations of a number of bird species, particularly those that adapt to different habitats and living conditions, are stable.\n\\r\nThese findings came from experts from the Zennenberg Center for Climate and Biodiversity Studies and the German Center for the Study of Integrated Biodiversity.\n\\xc2\\xa0\nThe results of the study are published in Conservation Biology.",
