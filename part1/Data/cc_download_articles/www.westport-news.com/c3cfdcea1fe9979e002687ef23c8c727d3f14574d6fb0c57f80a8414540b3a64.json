The only others onboard were two pilots and five crew members.\nThe Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one.\nStrimaitis told The Associated Press Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was \"a once in the lifetime experience.\"",
