Photo by Sonaz/Wikimedia Commons\nApril 8 (UPI) -- Rheinmetall was awarded a $122.8 million contract to supply Germany\\'s Bundeswehr with artillery shells for five years.\nThe contract will include 32,000 rounds of ammunition with an option of 11,000 more worth $41.7 million, the German-based company announced Monday.\nDelivery is scheduled to begin later this year.\nRheinmetall Waffe Munition will manufacture the 155mm DM-121 artillery ammunition in Unterlub.\nThe company previously delivered 30,000 shells in 2009.\nThe ammunition can attain a range of up to 18.6 miles when fired from the PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzer and land 85 percent of the time within an area the size of a soccer field.\nThe explosive round also can be used in training operations and field exercises.\n\"The insensitive explosive not only produces a devastating effect on and in the target, but also protects friendly forces if the ammunition is hit by hostile fire or exposed to other forms of mechanical stress, etc.,\" the company said.\nThe DM121 is capable of penetrating a wall of reinforced concrete several feet deep before detonating on the opposite side.\nIt is designed to operate in temperatures ranging from minus 46 degrees F to 145 degrees F.\nLast month, the German Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment awarded a $337.8 million contract to Krauss-Maffei Wegmann to upgrade 101 Leopard 2 main battle tanks by 2026.",
