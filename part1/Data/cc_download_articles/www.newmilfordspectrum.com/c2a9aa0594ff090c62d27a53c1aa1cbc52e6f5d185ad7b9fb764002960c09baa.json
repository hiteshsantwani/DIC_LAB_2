Merkel\\'s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she has met repeatedly with ex-heads of state and government \"with whom she worked together closely and well for a time.\"\nHe said the meeting has no implications for current German-U.S. relations. Asked whether it was a signal to President Donald Trump, with whom Germany has a sometimes-complicated relationship, Seibert replied: \"I would firmly reject that impression.\"\nMerkel and Obama have already met in Berlin since the former president left office, participating in a discussion at a May 2017 conference.",
