An agreement forged today between the European Commission and the European Space Agency marks the first steps towards creating a highly secure, pan-European quantum communication infrastructure.\nThe development of terrestrial components of the quantum communication infrastructure will be under the responsibility of the EC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG Connect).\nIt would comprise a series of quantum communication networks, linking institutional users and their critical infrastructures, and sensitive communication and data sites in Europe.\nThe space-based component, known as SAGA (Security And cryptoGrAphic mission), would be developed under ESA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s responsibility and consists of satellite quantum communication systems with pan-European reach.",
