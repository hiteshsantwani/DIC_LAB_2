He\\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah.\nHe says living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, and has no plans to move even as the show takes off.",
