Based on an original new story by J.K. Rowling, play by Jack Thorne, directed by John Tiffany. It is the eighth story in the Harry Potter series.\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child comes to Melbourne 0:29\nPolish Catholic priests condemning magic burned dozens of books they considered to be sacrilegious, including works from the Harry Potter series.\nThe SMS from Heaven Foundation \u2014 an evangelical group \u2014 posted photos of the burning at Gdansk\u2019s Mother of Church parish on Sunday on Facebook, saying in Polish: \u201cWe obey the Word.\u201d\nThe post continued with several passages from the Bible, including one from the Acts of the Apostles, saying \u201cmany of those who had practised magic collected their books and burned them in front of everyone. So they calculated their value and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver\u201d.\nThe post, which has gone viral, shows three priests carrying a basket of books and other items, including an African-style face mask through a church to an outside fire pit. A priest and altar boys are watching the book burning.\nOther items burned included a Hello Kitty umbrella and a Hindu religious figure.\nThe Polish episcopate and local bishop acknowledged the burning, but declined to comment, AFP reported.\nThe foundation said the book burning was intended to alert parishioners to bad influences that it says comes from magic and the occult.\nAccording to an unnamed parishioner from the church, people were asked to bring items linked to \u201cnegative energy\u201d and superstitious beliefs.\nThe post sparked controversy on Facebook with some calling it a joke.\n\u201cSeriously? Are people burning fantasy literature in the 21st century in some kind of sick ritual?!\u201d one person wrote in the comments section. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to believe that we\u2019re so backward!\u201d\nOthers supported the book burning, with one commenter saying: \u201cGet rid of everything that does not please God and see how your life will change.\u201d\nThe Harry Potter series, by British author J.K. Rowling, tells an epic story of good and evil. The stories focus on the adventures of bespectacled young wizard Harry Potter, who fights against the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort.\nSince it was launched in 1997, it has sometimes drawn criticisms from religious and conservative circles for its focus on witchcraft. More than 500 million copies have been sold worldwide.\nIn the US, there have been at least six book burnings of the series.\nRowling has not publicly commented on the book burning. In the past, she has argued that the books encompass all religions.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nThis story originally appeared on Fox News and was republished here with permission.",
