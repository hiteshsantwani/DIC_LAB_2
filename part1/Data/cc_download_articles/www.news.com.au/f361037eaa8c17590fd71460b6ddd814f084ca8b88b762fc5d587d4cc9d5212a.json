    "text": "British Prime Minister Theresa May has held talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as she works to break the Brexit deadlock.\nThe Labour leader says his meeting with Ms May was \\'useful but inconclusive\\', with both sides agreeing to further meetings.\nDespite the Prime Minister\\'s calls for national unity, Ms May\\'s decision has cost her two ministers, with Brexit Minister Chris Heaton-Harris and Nigel Adams from the Welsh Office both choosing to step down.\nThe EU has warned British lawmakers they must pass a deal by April 12 to avoid a long delay, as the block prepares for the European Parliamentary elections in May.\nBritain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s House of Commons has rejected a plan to hold more indicative votes on Brexit.\nMPs were tied on the amendment, voting 310-310 but Speaker John Bercow voted against it in accordance with the conventions of the House. Mr Bercow said the last time a vote in the Commons ended in a tie was in 1993.\nIt came as Prime Minister Theresa May met opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to seek a way out of a Brexit stalemate, a gamble that could see a European Union divorce deal finally clear parliament but also tear her party apart.\nBoth sides described the talks as \u201cconstructive\u201d.\nThe United Kingdom was supposed to leave the EU last Friday, but, nearly three years after Britons narrowly voted for Brexit in a referendum, it is still unclear how, when or even whether it will quit the bloc.\nAfter her EU withdrawal deal was rejected three times by MPs, with parliament and her Conservative Party hopelessly divided over Brexit, Mrs May said she would talk to the Labour Party leader in a bid to overcome what is now a national crisis.\n\u201cThere are actually a number of areas we agree on in relation to Brexit \u2026 what we want to do now is to find a way forward that can command the support of this House and deliver on Brexit,\u201d Mrs May told parliament.\nHowever, by approaching Mr Corbyn, a veteran socialist loathed by many of Mrs May\u2019s Conservatives and mocked by Mrs May herself as unfit to govern, she risks further inflaming divisions in her party.\nTwo junior ministers quit on Wednesday.\n\u201cIt now seems that you and your cabinet have decided that a deal \u2014 cooked up with a Marxist who has never once in his political life put British interests first \u2014 is better than \u2018no-deal\u2019,\u201d Nigel Adams said as he resigned as a minister for Wales.\nMrs May turned to Labour after a hardcore Eurosceptic group of Conservatives repeatedly rejected her divorce deal, saying it would leave Britain a \u201cvassal state\u201d.\nLabour wants to stay in a customs union with the EU, raising the likelihood of a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit option that keeps Britain\u2019s economy closely aligned to the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc.\nBrexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the government would accept a soft Brexit if parliament voted for it.\nMrs May said on Tuesday she would seek \u201cas short as possible\u201d a delay to the current Brexit date of April 12, having repeatedly said she did not want Britain to have to take part in European parliament elections on May 23.\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he believed EU leaders were open to further delay and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would \u201cfight until the last minute\u201d for an orderly British exit.\nBut European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said Britain would not get any further short delays unless its parliament ratified a deal by April 12 \u2014 the date set by EU leaders as the effective cut-off for avoiding the European parliament elections.\nMeanwhile Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned on Wednesday that Britain still faced an \u201calarmingly high\u201d risk of a no-deal Brexit, which could happen suddenly and by accident without politicians fully intending it.\nThe idea, promoted by some Brexit supporters, that Britain could effectively trade on World Trade Organisation terms with zero tariffs after a no-deal Brexit was \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d, Mr Carney added in the interview with broadcaster Sky News.\nMr Carney said that as long ago as August last year, he had described the chance of Britain leaving the EU without any transition deal as uncomfortably high.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alarmingly high now,\u201d he said.",
