    "text": "An Australian cricketer accused of committing rape during a sexual conquest had slept with 20 women during a similar competition a year earlier, a court has heard.\nFormer county all-rounder Alex Hepburn denies raping a woman who claims he began attacking her while she was asleep at his flat in Worcester in April 2017.\nA retrial at the city\u2019s Crown Court has been told the complainant contacted police after realising she was in bed with Hepburn and not his then teammate Joe Clarke.\nProsecutors allege Hepburn, then aged 21, raped the woman, who was also aged in her 20s, in a bedroom while Clarke, who had been sick, was asleep in a bathroom.\nDuring his evidence on the third day of his trial, Hepburn said the woman made eye contact with him and then kissed him, instigating a \u201cnormal\u201d sexual encounter lasting about 20 minutes.\nHepburn \u2014 who posted the rules of the competition on a WhatsApp group in the week before the alleged rape \u2014 told jurors he was confused when the woman pushed him off and asked: \u201cWhere\u2019s Joe?\u201d\nHepburn, who came to the UK aged 17 to join the Worcestershire side, said of the alleged rape: \u201cI got onto the mattress, that\u2019s when I first realised there was a woman in the bed.\n\u201cThis woman rolled towards me, we made eye contact, and she kissed me.\u201d\nHepburn, now 23, added he could see the woman\u2019s eyes were open and she had instigated the kissing at his flat in Portland Street, Worcester.\n\u201cShe was engaging in the act, so I presumed she was enjoying it,\u201d Hepburn said on Wednesday.\nAsked about the moment the woman is alleged to have realised she was not with Clarke, Hepburn added: \u201cShe said, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 to which I replied, \u2018What do you mean?\u2019\n\u201cI was confused why she had asked me that question. It was no different to a normal sexual encounter.\u201d\nHepburn\u2019s defence barrister, Michelle Heeley QC, asked him: \u201cHad it occurred to you that she might have thought she was having sex with Joe as opposed to you?\u201d\nHepburn answered: \u201cNo.\u201d\nThe court has heard the alleged victim, who had been drinking wine and spirits, had earlier had consensual sex with Clarke who she had met in a nightclub.\nAt the start of about 90 minutes of testimony, Hepburn admitted he sent \u201cdisgusting, horrible and embarrassing\u201d WhatsApp messages while setting the rules of the sexual conquest competition.\nJurors were told Hepburn jokingly referred to rape in one of the messages on the \u201cstat chat\u201d group set up to keep a score of women its members had slept with.\nDescribing the group as a silly competition, Hepburn said some of the messages referred to threesomes \u2014 while another confirmed that women who cricketers had previously slept with did not count.\nDuring cross-examination, Hepburn told prosecutor Miranda Moore QC that up to six cricketers had taken part in the so-called stat game in 2016.\nHepburn then denied he had regarded himself as \u201cGod\u2019s gift to women\u201d and dismissed a rule of the game stipulating women should be rated out of 10 as \u201cjust immature chat to speak with each other\u201d.\nAsked to give a \u201cball-park\u201d figure for his score the previous year, Hepburn told the court: \u201c20.\u201d\nThe trial continues.",
