    "text": "He\\'s making headlines globally, but what exactly is going on with Julian Assange, Ecuador and the UK?\nJulian Assange has been arrested after he was kicked out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London almost seven years after seeking asylum.\nIn a statement, Metropolitan Police confirmed the Wikileaks founder had been taken into custody and then was \u201cfurther arrested on behalf of the United States\u201d.\nPolice said they were \u201cinvited into the embassy by the Ambassador, following the Ecuadorian government\u2019s withdrawal of asylum\u201d.\nIn a video capturing Assange\u2019s arrest, the bearded 47-year-old could be seen being dragged out of the embassy in handcuffs, clutching a book.\n\u201cThe UK has no freedom. The UK has no stability. The UK must resist,\u201d Assange appeared to yell as he was dragged into a police van by four Scotland Yard detectives.\n#BREAKING: @wikileaks founder Julian Assange has been arrested by police at the Ecuadorian embassy in London pic.twitter.com/4e3Xhu0Wzy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Amichai Stein (@AmichaiStein1) April 11, 2019\nThe book Assange was clutching as he was dragged down the embassy steps was History of the National Security State by Gore Vidal.\nThe novel \u201cdiscusses the historical events that led to the establishment of the massive military-industrial-security complex and the political culture that gave us the \u2018Imperial Presidency\u2019,\u201d its Amazon description reads.\nAssange is due to appear in a London court later today and Australia has requested consular access.\nASSANGE \u2018FURTHER ARRESTED ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\u2019\nThe Wikileaks founder has been living in the embassy for almost seven years after a warrant was issued for his arrest on June 29, 2012 when he failed to surrender to Westminster Magistrate\u2019s Court.\nBut Assange isn\u2019t just facing criminal charges in the UK, he\u2019s also facing treason charges in the US after he released thousands of classified government documents through Wikileaks.\nJen Robinson, who has previously represented Assange as his lawyer, confirmed the 47-year-old was arrested \u201cnot just for breach of bail conditions but also in relation to a US extradition request\u201d.\nAustralian Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne said consular officers would seek to visit Assange at his \u201cplace of detention\u201d in London police station.\n\u201cMr Assange will continue to receive the usual consular support from the Australian Government,\u201d Ms Payne said in a statement.\n\u201cI am confident, as the United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt publicly confirmed in July 2018, that Mr Assange will receive due process in the legal proceedings he faces in the United Kingdom.\u201d\nWikileaks had previously expressed fears Assange\u2019s arrest for violating his bail conditions in the UK would be used as a pretext to extradite him to the US.\nMetropolitan Police confirmed Assange had \u201cbeen further arrested on behalf of the United States authorities\u201d after he arrived at central London police station.\n\u201cThis is an extradition warrant under Section 73 of the Extradition Act. He will appear in custody at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court as soon as possible,\u201d police said.\nThrough Wikileaks, Assange published the Afghanistan War Diary, a collection of some 90,000 mainly secret US government documents relating to the military engagement of Allied forces in Afghanistan, in July 2010.\nThree months later, WikiLeaks published 400,000 classified documents in its Iraq War Diary.\nCriminal charges were filed against Assange by the US Justice Department back in 2012 related to the publication of the classified documents which humiliated and exposed the government.\nWikileaks has since responded to Assange\u2019s dramatic arrest, specifically calling out the CIA.\nThis man is a son, a father, a brother. He has won dozens of journalism awards. He\\'s been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize every year since 2010. Powerful actors, including CIA, are engaged in a sophisticated effort to dehumanise, delegitimize and imprison him. #ProtectJulian pic.twitter.com/dVBf1EcMa5 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 11, 2019\n\u2018THE PATIENCE OF ECUADOR HAS REACHED ITS LIMIT\u2019 \u2014 ASSANGE\u2019S END\nEcuadorian President Lenin Moreno took to social media to explain why Assange had been kicked out of the embassy, claiming the Australian-born computer program had repeatedly violated international conventions.\nThe \u201caggressive and discorteous behaviour (of Assange), the hostile and threatening declarations of its allied organisation against Ecuador, and especially the transgression of international treaties have led the situation to a point where the asylum of Assange is unsustainable and no longer viable,\u201d President Moreno said.\nIn a sovereign decision Ecuador withdrew the asylum status to Julian Assange after his repeated violations to international conventions and daily-life protocols. #EcuadorSoberano pic.twitter.com/pZsDsYNI0B \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Len\\xc3\\xadn Moreno (@Lenin) April 11, 2019\nIn his video, President Moreno said Ecuador had \u201cprotected the human rights\u201d of Assange for six years and ten months.\nMr Moreno said the Wikileaks founder had repeatedly been asked to \u201crespect and abide by the rules\u201d but the \u201cpatience of Ecuador has reached its limit on the behaviour of Assange\u201d.\nThe Ecuadorian president also claimed Assange \u201cinstalled electronic and distortion equipment\u201d and \u201cblocked security cameras\u201d in the embassy.\nHe also accused him of \u201cmistreating guards\u201d and \u201caccessing security files in the embassy without permission\u201d.\nAssange originally sought asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in June 2012 after Swedish police charged him with sexual assualt.\nThe Wikileaks founder was facing extradition from those charges however the probe was later dropped. Assange also strongly denied the charges.\nAssange\u2019s relationship with his hosts collapsed after Ecuador accused him of leaking information about President Moreno\u2019s personal life.\nMr Moreno had previously said Assange has violated the terms of his asylum.\nThe president said that he had asked Britain to guarantee that Assange would not be extradited to a country where he could face torture or the death penalty.\n\u201cThe British government has confirmed it in writing, in accordance with its own rules,\u201d Mr Moreno said.\nVia Twitter, UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid praised the arrest and said \u201cno one is above the law\u201d.\nNearly 7yrs after entering the Ecuadorean Embassy, I can confirm Julian Assange is now in police custody and rightly facing justice in the UK. I would like to thank Ecuador for its cooperation & @metpoliceuk for its professionalism. No one is above the law \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Sajid Javid (@sajidjavid) April 11, 2019\nIn a statement, the Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Sir Alan Duncan, said the UK was grateful to Ecuador.\n\u201cIt is absolutely right that Assange will face justice in the proper way in the UK. It is for the courts to decide what happens next,\u201d Sir Duncan said.\n\u201cWe are very grateful to the government of Ecuador under President Moreno for the action they have taken.\n\u201cToday\u2019s events follow extensive dialogue between our two countries. I look forward to a strong bilateral relationship between the UK and Ecuador in the years ahead.\u201d\nEcuador gave Assange citizenship in December 2017 but he has long been an annoyance for the staff at the embassy.\nThe 47-year-old lost his wifi in the embassy in March last year after Ecuadorian officials accused him of using the internet to try and influence other countries politics.\nPresident Moreno disputed Assange\u2019s loss of internet in his statement today, saying he has had a mobile phone the entire time to \u201ccommunicate with the outside world\u201d.\nAssange sued the Ecuadorian government in October, accusing the country of violating his civil rights.\nThe lawsuit came after embassy staff limited Assange\u2019s visitors and demanding he had to clean his bathroom and care for his cat.\n\u2018DARK MOMENT FOR FREEDOM\u2019\nAssange\u2019s case has opened up explosive debate about security and free speech.\nHis supporters view him as a crusader who fearlessly exposes injustices such as torture and alleged war crimes committed by the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nThe 47-year-old Australian\u2019s critics accuse him of cosying up to authoritarian leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and putting Americans\u2019 lives at risk.\nFugitive former US government contractor Edward Snowden \u2014 himself wanted for leaking details of secret US surveillance programmes \u2014 called Assange\u2019s arrest a \u201cdark moment for press freedom\u201d.\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Britain of \u201cstrangling freedom\u201d.\nAssange\u2019s mother Christine tweeted that she had been advised that her son faces up to 12 months in a British prison.\n\u201cOur focus is as always to STOP a U.S. Extradition!\u201d she wrote.\nTHE JULIAN ASSANGE SAGA\nJULY 2010 WikiLeaks releases its Afghanistan War Diary, a collection of some 90,000 mainly secret US government documents relating to the military engagement of Allied forces in Afghanistan.\nAUGUST 2010 Swedish prosecutors issue arrest warrant for Assange in connection with claims of sexual offences.\nOCTOBER 2010 WikiLeaks publishes 400,000 classified documents in its Iraq War Diary.\nDECEMBER 2010 Assange gives himself up to British police.
