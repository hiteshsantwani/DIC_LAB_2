    "text": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, is due to give birth this month and is being urged to skip the traditional photocall outside the hospital after her baby arrives.\nBoth Kate Middleton and Princess Diana appeared outside their maternity wards to proudly reveal their new royal babies, but some parents have claimed it puts pressure on new mums, reports The Sun.\nWhen Kate stepped out to present Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, she looked flawless with perfect make-up and a bouncy blow dry by her hair stylist Amanda Cook Tyler.\nBut Chelsea Hirschhorn, CEO of parenting company Fridababy, hopes Meghan break\u2019s the tradition.\nShe wrote in an open letter: \u201cDear Royal Mum-To-Be,\n\u201cYou will soon give birth to one of the most anticipated babies in the world and like your princess predecessors, you\u2019ll be expected to parade outside of the hospital in front of throngs of photographers to show off your new bundle of joy shortly after giving birth.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll smile, you\u2019ll wave, you\u2019ll be radiant, but between your legs will be a whole different story.\n\u201cSure your blowout will be perfect for your hospital step photo-op, but people will be opening on all the wrong things \u2014 like how soon you will fit into your pre-baby wardrobe \u2014 instead of having an honest conversation about what women go through during birth and immediately after.\n\u201cBut us mums will know that while you wave from that step you\u2019ll be one pair of mesh underwear away from your first post-baby poop (brace yourself)!\nMORE: Meghan breaks with tradition for birth\nMORE: Meghan\u2019s fatal \u2018weakness\u2019 exposed\nMORE: Meghan\u2019s unlikely Aussie celeb feud\n\u201cSpoiler alert: Bringing a new life into the world usually starts with your vagina, and the aftermath is a mess.\n\u201cThe bleeding and swelling will linger, peeing will burn, and sitting like your old self will feel like a herculean feat.\n\u201cAnd if it\u2019s a C-section, there\u2019s a whole host of other issues to tend to.\u201d\nMs Hirschhorn added that no matter how glamorous Meghan may look on the day, she \u201cwon\u2019t feel like herself\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cWhen the \u2018big reveal\u2019 day arrives but you\u2019re feeling like all the King\u2019s horses and all the King\u2019s men couldn\u2019t put your vagina back together again \u2014 use this stage to do your part for all women.\n\u201cSkip the pomp and circumstance of the baby parade.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cIf you really can\u2019t skip it, then at the very least flash us a glimpse of the mesh underwear underneath to keep it real.\u201d\nAlthough the letter is intended to be tongue-in-cheek, it serves as a reminder as to how unreasonable it is to expect women to look perfect after birth, including the royals.\nAccording to royal correspondent Emily Andrews, a source revealed that Meghan might indeed skip the tradition for her birth.\nThe insider said: \u201cHarry and Meghan realise there is intense public interest but this baby is not a direct heir to the throne and they want the birth to be as private as possible.\n\u201cMeghan is nervous about complications such as an emergency Caesarean and doesn\u2019t want the pressure of having to look immaculate on the hospital steps just hours later.\n\u201cLike any anxious first-time mum, she\u2019s worried about the birth itself.\n\u201cAs she is over 35, she is considered a slightly older mum \u2014 which sometimes can lead to some complications.\n\u201cMeghan also has the added stress of the world\u2019s attention on her \u2014 everyone wants to catch the first glimpse of the new royal addition.\n\u201cShe and Harry have decided that rather than go somewhere as public as the Lindo they will allow Meghan to recover somewhere more private.\n\u201cShe just wants a normal, natural birth and to bond with her baby, without being primped and blow-dried to within an inch of her life just for the pictures.\u201d\nLast year actress Keira Knightley, criticised 37-year-old Kate\u2019s seemingly perfect post-baby appearances.\nShe said the fact that Kate \u201cwas out of hospital seven hours later with her face made up and high heels on\u201d felt unrealistic and not achievable for a lot of women.\nThis story was originally published in The Sun and is reprinted with permission.",
