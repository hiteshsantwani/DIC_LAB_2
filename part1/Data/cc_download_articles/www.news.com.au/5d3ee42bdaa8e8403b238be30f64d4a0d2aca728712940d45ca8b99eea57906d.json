    "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have set up their own official Instagram account.\nPrince Harry and wife Meghan, who are expecting a baby this month, said @SussexRoyal would be used to share the work that drives them, and important announcements.\nThe move comes as the duke and duchess are splitting their household from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, whose Instagram account is @KensingtonRoyal. Meghan and Harry\u2019s new household will be based at Buckingham Palace, while William \u2014 the future King \u2014 and Kate will remain at Kensington Palace.\nIn a message on their first post, Harry and Meghan thanked people for their support, saying: \u201cWelcome to our official Instagram; we look forward to sharing the work that drives us, the causes we support, important announcements, and the opportunity to shine a light on key issues.\nRELATED: Meghan and Kate\u2019s secret pact\nRELATED: Meghan\u2019s new pressure ahead of birth\nRELATED: How Meghan made UK turn on Kate\n\u201cWe thank you for your support, and welcome you to @sussexroyal \u2014 Harry & Meghan.\u201d\nIt was accompanied by an image bearing a white version of couple\u2019s royal cipher \u2014 the entwined initials H and M below a coronet \u2014 on a navy background. Kensington Palace\u2019s Twitter feed introduced the new account, saying: \u201cWelcome to Instagram, SussexRoyal!\u201d\nThe first post was a picture of their joint \u201cHM\u201d monogram, followed by a gallery of nine of their favourite images, including a previously unseen photo taken of the couple on Sydney Harbour during their royal tour last year.\nThe photo show Harry and Meghan on both solo and joint engagements and were taken around the world, with UK outings showcased alongside their recent visit to Morocco.\nThey were shared alongside a note from the couple welcoming fans to the page and \u2018thanking them for the support\u2019.\nThe account has racked up almost 400,000 followers, including celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow, David Beckham and Blake Lively.\nIt comes as Modern Family star Ed O\u2019Neill revealed the Duchess of Sussex \u201cgrew up\u201d on the set of the classic 90s sitcom Married \u2026 with Children.\nSpeaking to Ellen DeGeneres, the actor said: \u201cBy the way, she grew up on the set of Married \u2026 with Children. Did you know that? Her father was a camera operator.\u201d\nMeghan\u2019s estranged father, Thomas, worked on the show for 10 of its 11 seasons, first as a lighting director and then as the director of photography.\n\u201cShe used to come on the set in a little Catholic school uniform. She was like 9,\u201d O\u2019Neill recalled.\nMeghan recalled hanging out on set during a 2018 interview with Esquire.\n\u201cMy dad was a lighting director and director of photography for Married \u2026 with Children. He just retired actually last year.\n\u201cEvery day after school for 10 years, I was on the set of Married \u2026 with Children, which is a really funny and perverse place for a little girl in a Catholic school uniform to grow up,\u201d she told the magazine.\n\u201cThere were a lot of times my dad would say, \u2018Meg, why don\u2019t you go and help with the craft services room over there? This is just a little off-colour for your 11-year-old eyes,\u2019\u201d she recalled.\nMeghan also told the magazine she \u201cwasn\u2019t allowed to watch the show at home\u201d, but, \u201cI could watch the end credits so I could give the screen a kiss when I saw my dad\u2019s name go by\u201d.\nMarkle also recalled some of the actresses, some of whom had worked in the adult movie industry, turning up on set.\n\u201cYou gotta think, there were guest stars like Tia Carrere and Traci Lords and Nikki Cox,\u201d Meghan said.\n\u201cThose were the kind of women coming in every day. Just picture me with my curly hair and a gap in my teeth and my little school uniform with Keds on, looking up like, \u2018Hi,\u2019 at these very, uh, provocative women. It was a big change from Immaculate Heart Catholic School.\u201d",
