    "text": "The European Union are expected to grant the British Prime Minister a second delay to Britain\\'s exit from the bloc. Rough cut (no reporter narration)\nEuropean Union leaders on Thursday offered Britain a delay to its EU departure date until Halloween.\nLeaders of the 27 remaining EU member states met for more than six hours before agreeing to postpone Brexit until October 31, two officials said.\nThe officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed- door negotiations.\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk confirmed in a tweet that an extension had been agreed to, but he did not disclose the date.\nEU27 has agreed an extension of Art. 50. I will now meet PM @theresa_may for the UK government's agreement. #Brexit \u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) April 10, 2019\nMay, who had sought a delay only until June 30, still has to agree to the offer.\nEU leaders spent a long dinner meeting wrangling over whether to save Britain from a precipitous and potentially calamitous Brexit, or to give the foot-dragging departing nation a shove over the edge.\nMay pleaded with them at an emergency summit to delay Britain\u2019s exit, due on Friday, until June 30 while the UK sorts out the mess that Brexit has become.\nSome were sympathetic, but French President Emmanuel Macron struck a warning note.\n\u201cNothing is decided,\u201d Macron said, insisting on \u201cclarity\u201d from May about what Britain wants.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s indispensable is that nothing should compromise the European project in the months to come,\u201d he said.\nMay believes that a June 30 deadline is enough time for Britain\u2019s parliament to ratify a Brexit deal and pass the legislation needed for a smooth Brexit.\nBut British politicians have rejected her divorce deal three times, and attempts to forge a compromise with her political opponents have yet to bear fruit.\nMay spoke to the 27 EU leaders for just over an hour, before they met for dinner without her to decide Britain\u2019s fate.\nIn contrast to some testy recent summits, there were signs of warmth and even humour. May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were filmed laughing over a tablet bearing an image showing the two of them speaking to their respective Parliaments on Wednesday wearing similar blue jackets.\nMany leaders said they were inclined to grant a Brexit delay, though Macron had reservations after hearing May speak. An official in the French president\u2019s office said the British leader hadn\u2019t offered \u201csufficient guarantees\u201d to justify a long extension.\nMacron is concerned that letting Britain stay too long would distract the EU from other issues \u2014 notably next month\u2019s European parliament elections.\n\u201cThe no-deal situation is a real option,\u201d said the official, who was not authorised to be publicly named according to presidential policy.\n\u201cPutting in danger the functioning of Europe is not preferable to a no-deal.\u201d\nOthers suggested a longer delay would likely be needed, given the depth of Britain\u2019s political disarray.\nMay signalled she would accept a longer extension, as long as it contained a get-out-early cause should Britain end its Brexit impasse.\n\u201cWhat is important is that any extension enables us to leave at the point at which we ratify the withdrawal agreement,\u201d May said as she arrived in Brussels. She added that she was hopeful it could be as soon as May 22 \u2014 a key date since that would avoid the need for Britain to participate in elections for the European parliament.",
