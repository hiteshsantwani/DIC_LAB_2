    "text": "Ever ridden with an elephant, or got a selfie with a tiger in Bali or other animal parks? Chances are these parks are committing acts of animal cruelty and the animals are suffering in horrible conditions\nHoliday-makers are being urged to stop riding donkeys up Santorini\\xe2\\x80\\x99s steep steps in a new campaign on the idyllic Greek island.\nDistressing images of the donkeys struggling up 600 zigzagging steps while weighed down by obese tourists sparked fury last summer.\nIn response to the outrage, fat tourists \u2014 or those weighing more than 100kg (15.7 stone) \u2014 were banned from riding on the donkeys in October last year.\nAnd now a campaign aimed at all holiday-makers is ready to be launched by activists in collaboration with the cruise-line industry.\n\u201cThe campaign is about to start,\u201d said Nikos Zorzos, the island\u2019s mayor, The Guardian reported.\n\u201cRepresentatives from the cruise liner association were here in my office this week promising to raise awareness (of the problem) and from our side we\u2019ll be distributing information leaflets.\n\u201cOur mules and donkeys are part of our tradition. Younger owners, especially, have understood that they need to be looked after.\u201d\nThe animals have long been used to carry people from the volcanic isle\u2019s port to its main settlement 400 metres above sea level.\nBut as tourist numbers have soared in recent years, the donkeys have been forced to make four or five return journeys up the cobbled steps on the cliff-side path in searing temperatures.\nThe Greek island\u2019s famous donkeys have been struck down with spinal injuries, saddle sores and exhaustion after being forced to carry the increasingly heavy cargo.\nThey work long hours, seven days a week without shelter, rest and water.\nLast summer, more than 108,000 people signed an online petition deploring what it described as the \u201cmindless and unnecessary torture (of equines) used as cruel transportation for people who want the \u2018real Greek\u2019 experience\u201d.\nIn response to this, the country\u2019s Ministry of Rural Development and Food published a new set of regulations regarding donkeys\u2019 wellbeing.\nThese state donkeys giving tourists rides in Santorini should not carry any loads heavier than 100kg, or one-fifth of their weight.\nA government statement read: \u201cThe owners of working equidae should ensure that the animals\u2019 level of health is high.\n\u201cUnder no circumstances should be used animals unfit for work i.e., ill animal, injured, animals in an advanced pregnancy as well as animals with poor maintenance of hooves.\n\u201cThe animals should be given appropriate and adequate food and fresh drinking water daily, into containers which cannot be contaminated and are cleaned at least once a day.\n\u201cWorking equines should not be loaded with excessive weight for their size, age or physical condition. The load cannot exceed the weight of 100kg, or one fifth of their body weight.\u201d\nIn June, charities there claimed the explosion of fat tourists meant locals who are keen to get the most out of their animals were being forced to crossbreed the animals to create mules, which are bigger and taller and can carry heavier loads with more stamina.\nElisavet Chatzi, 45, a volunteer from Athens who participated in peaceful protest in Santorini over donkeys\u2019 treatment there earlier this year, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a very big step, I think all our hard work has paid off.\n\u201cThe situation in Santorini has been going on for many years and it cannot be resolved in one day.\n\u201cWe have won our fight because of the international media attention on the topic. No one could ever believe that new regulations would be set.\n\u201cThe next day after the bulletin was released, I was told a tourist had been carried up the hill by three different donkeys, so as not to exhaust them.\u201d\nBut other campaigners allege that despite the reminder, nothing has changed on the island and there is still a long way to go.\nMaria Skourta, 42, the leader of the Athens branch of Direct Action Everywhere, claims: \u201cWe were content with the bulletin because the purpose of our organisation is to bring matters to light and initiate conversation.\n\u201cBut our goal is not to improve the lives of slaves, it\u2019s to free them entirely.\n\u201cWhile this means they will stop carrying fat tourists, the donkeys are still forced to carry cement, appliances and all sorts of heavy weights.\u201d\nThis story originally appeared on The Sun and has been reproduced with permission",
