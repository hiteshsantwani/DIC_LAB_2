    "text": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are following in the footsteps of Princess Diana.\nPrincess Diana\\xe2\\x80\\x98s injury shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have killed her, the UK\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top forensic pathologist argues in a new book.\nDr. Richard Shepherd, who investigated the death of the Princess of Wales, says her \u201cvery tiny\u201d injury \u2014 a tear in a vein \u2014 only caused her death because it was in the wrong place, hidden deep in her lung.\n\u201cHer specific injury is so rare that in my entire career I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve seen another,\u201d Shepherd writes in a new book, extracted in the Daily Mail.\n\u201cDiana\u2019s death is a classic example of the way we say, after almost every day: if only,\u201d Shepherd continues. \u201cIf only she had hit the seat in the front at a slightly different angle. If only she had been thrown forward 10mph more slowly.\u201d\nInjuries the royal mum-of-two sustained in the 1997 car crash in a Paris tunnel proved fatal.\nBut one thing that could have saved her was totally within her control, Shepherd argued.\n\u201cIf only she had been wearing a seatbelt,\u201d he writes. \u201cHad she been restrained, she would have probably appeared in public two days later with a black eye, perhaps a little breathless from the fractured ribs and with a broken arm in a sling.\u201d\nThis story originally appeared on the New York Post and was reproduced with permission",
