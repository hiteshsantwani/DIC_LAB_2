The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the talks.\n\\t\nWhile May now has until Oct. 31 to find backing for her unloved Brexit withdrawal deal, Britain could still leave earlier if talks with the country\\'s opposition Labour Party find a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament.\n\\t\n\"I continue to believe we need to leave the EU, with a deal, as soon as possible,\" May told reporters.\n\\t\nManfred Weber, a German who leads the biggest group in the European Parliament, said Europe showed \"patience and unity\" in avoiding a damaging no-deal Brexit. But he added that \"the political uncertainty in London has been extended, which risks affecting debates about the future of Europe.\"\n\\t\nGermany\\'s Spiegel Online called the early-morning agreement a \"classic Brussels compromise.\"\n\\t\n\"The EU retained its unity on Brexit \u2014 albeit only just,\" it said.\n\\t\nThe British press compared the latest Brexit machinations to Wednesday\\'s other big news \u2014 the publication of the first-ever photograph of a black hole.\n\\t\n\\t\n\"Here\\'s another inescapable black hole,\" The Times wrote under the photo, referencing Britain\\'s Brexit impasse.\n\\t\n____\n\\t\nAssociated Press writers Frank Jordans in Berlin and Danica Kirka in London contributed to this report.",
