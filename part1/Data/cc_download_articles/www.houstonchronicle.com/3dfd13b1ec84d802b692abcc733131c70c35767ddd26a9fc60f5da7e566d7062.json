The Current will be led by retired Olympic backstroke champion Lenny Krayzelburg, the Condors by retired four-time Olympic champion Jason Lezak, and the Trident by Sandeno.\n\\t\n\\t\nThe European teams will be based in London, Rome, Budapest and likely France.\n\\t\nFull rosters will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\\t\nSwimmers will compete for team points in various styles of races, with 12 men and 12 women on each team. The ISL said numerous Olympic champions and world record holders will participate.\n\\t\n\"There\\'s something about competing for a team title,\" five-time Olympic champion Adrian said. \"It\\'s a different kind of energy than what swimmers are used to.\"\n\\t\nThe ISL will have a zero tolerance doping policy and won\\'t allow any swimmer with a previous doping violation to participate.\n\\t\nSwimmers will sign two contracts: one with their team and another with the ISL. Revenue will flow from the clubs and the league to the athletes. Grigorishin said revenue will be split 50-50 between the league and swimmers.\n\\t\n\"We have one of the hardest working athletes in the sports world and they deserve more than we have gotten so far,\" Krayzelburg said. \"It\\'s going to change the landscape, create more exposure and opportunities for our athletes and put the sport of swimming on the forefront, not just in the Olympic year.\"\n\\t\nCurrently, professional swimmers have the TYR Pro Swim Series in the U.S. and the FINA World Cup between August and November in Europe, Asia and the Middle East in which they compete for prize money.\n\\t\nThe ISL has overcome roadblocks to its formation, having filed a federal antitrust lawsuit last year against FINA, the sport\\'s international governing body.\n\\t\nFINA announced its own Champions Swim Series made up of invitation-only meets in Guangzhou, Budapest and Indianapolis in April and May. Total prize money is $3.9 million and the competitions will include some of the sport\\'s biggest names.\n\\t\n\\t\n\"We have no principle conflict with FINA,\" Grigorishin said. \"FINA should be responsible for the whole swimming world. The league is just for the elite swimmers. Somebody has to regulate and set up the rules in swimming. If you are a regulator, you should not be organizer of competition. In the future, FINA will have to make a choice.\"\n\\t\nGrigorishin said negotiations with global broadcasting outlets are ongoing.",
