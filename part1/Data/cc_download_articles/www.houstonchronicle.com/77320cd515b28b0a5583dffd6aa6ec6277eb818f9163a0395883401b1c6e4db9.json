May says she \"accepts\" the EU position that if Britain hasn't left the 28-nation bloc by May 23, it will have a legal obligation to take part in the elections. The prime minister says she is still hopeful of reaching a compromise agreement that could take Britain out of the EU before that time. ___ 9:20 a.m. British Prime Minister Theresa May is requesting that the deadline for her country to leave the European Union be extended until June 30.
