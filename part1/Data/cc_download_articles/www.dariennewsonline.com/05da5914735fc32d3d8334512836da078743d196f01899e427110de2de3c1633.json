She said \"we should listen to what he wants to do\" but \"we don\\'t offer asylum to someone who\\'s not asking for it.\"\nMacron hasn\\'t commented publicly.\nAssange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.\n___\n9 a.m.\nThe leader of Britain\\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.\nJeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed \"evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan.\"\nDiane Abbott, Labour\\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.\nAbbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the \"embarrassment of the things he\\'s revealed about the American military and security services.\"\nShe says Assange is \"a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest.\"",
