    "text": "The so-called \u201cyellow vest\u201d demonstrations against the French President started in mid-November over planned fuel tax hikes but quickly spiralled into a revolt against the Government\u2019s alleged elitism. Hosting BBC This Week, Andrew Neil said the political drama in Britain could actually be a sign of a \u201cvibrant democracy\u201d as he highlighted on the current uproar across the continent. Mr Neil said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t had the gilets jaunes. There is a kind of nasty undercurrent that I see from both sides at times.\nWe are not setting fire to Oxford Street every Saturday afternoon Andrew Neil\n\u201cWe certainly are not setting fire to Oxford Street every Saturday afternoon the way the French are setting fire to the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. \u201cWe don\u2019t have 93 hard right MPs in our Parliament the way the Germans have in the Bundestag. \u201cIn a way, you could look at this and say Parliament is right at the forefront \u2013 people are watching it, ratings for political programmes are very high these days and newspapers. \u201cYou could say this is actually a sign of a vibrant democracy.\u201d\nBrexit news: Andrew Neil said Britain has a \"vibrant democracy\"\nMr Macron hit out at Britain this week and said the EU \u201ccannot be the hostage for the solution to a political crisis in the UK\u201d. The French President also indicated he is losing patience with the lack of progress being made by British politicians. Speaking alongside Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar outside the Elysee Palace in Paris ahead of their meeting on Tuesday, he said: \u201cLet me repeat this \u2013 our priority is the good functioning of the EU and the single market. \u201cThe EU cannot sustainably be the hostage for the solution to a political crisis in the UK.",
