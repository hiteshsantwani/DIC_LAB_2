    "text": "Eurozone warning: No-deal Brexit could spark a further slowdown in growth across the eurozone\nECB Vice President Luis de Guindos urged markets to brace for the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal in place, or risk amplifying a downward financial trend in Europe. Analysts have become increasingly concerned over the state of the euro area economy in recent months following a string of weak data releases pointing toward a slowdown in economic growth. The disappointing trend has been led by Germany, the largest economy in Europe, where the economic growth forecast was recently slashed by nearly half as manufacturing levels took a tumble. Speaking to lawmakers in the European Parliament, Mr de Guindos said: \u201cWe are living in a moment of slowdown of the global and the European economy.\n\u201cA no-deal that is not truly priced in by the market could be a sort of amplifier of the downhill turn of the deceleration of the European economy.\u201d Although he described the risk as \u201cmanageable\u201d, the main issue of a no-deal Brexit was piling pressure on an already fragile eurozone economy. He said: \u201cThis will be bad news on top of the fragility of the economy.\u201d The ECB has shelved plans to raise interest rates this year, leaving banks, particularly in France and Germany, bracing for yet more losses on the excess cash they deposit at the central bank.\nThis will be bad news on top of the fragility of the economy Luis de Guindos\nMr de Guindos said the ECB was looking at ways of \u201ctiering\u201d the negative interest rate that banks pay on the idle cash, although no discussion had yet taken place among policymakers. He said: \u201cWe are continuously analysing the possibilities, alternatives in terms of tiering because in other jurisdictions they were implemented. \u201cBut so far we have not taken any decision.\u201d Negative interest rates have been a feature of central banks\u2019 response to the financial crisis that started a decade ago and have been credited with helping stave off the threat of deflation in 2014-16.\nEurozone warning: ECB President Mario Draghi",
