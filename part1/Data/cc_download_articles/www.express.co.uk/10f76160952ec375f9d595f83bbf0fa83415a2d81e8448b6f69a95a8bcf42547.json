    "text": "Prime Minister Theresa May secured a six-month Brexit delay this week after she wrote to the European Council President asking for an extension to Article 50 last week. But, the decision angered some Conservative Brexit supporters, with Sir Bill Cash standing up in the Commons on Thursday asking when the Prime Minister will resign. Speaking on BBC News, professor Matthew Goodwin, claimed the Prime Minister will \u201calmost certainly\u201d face a \u201crenewed\u201d attempt by MPs to oust her during the six-month period.\nHe said: \u201cOn one level you could argue that this extension gives Mrs May a bit more room for manoeuvre. \u201cThat the pressure, at least in the short term, is off and she can get on with those talks with the Labour Party, which we just heard are ongoing today.\u201d He added: \u201cBut, of course, seen from the perspective of the Conservative Party, Mrs May coming back with yet another extension, is a more diminished figure. \u201cSomebody who is almost certainly now going to face a renewed attempt to have her stand down and make way for somebody else.\u201d\nBrexit news: Matthew Goodwin claimed May would face a \\'renewed\\' attempt to oust her\nMrs May coming back with yet another extension, is a more diminished figure Professor Matthew Goodwin\nMrs May promised her own MPs last month that she will not lead the next stage of the Brexit process and would stand down as leader once her deal passes through the Commons. On Thursday prominent Tory Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash accused the Prime Minister of \"abject surrender\" to the EU and asked if she would resign. Mrs May replied: \"I think you know the answer to that.\" Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, the Prime Minister told MPs it was their \"national duty\" to agree to a Brexit deal.\nShe said: \u201cWe need to resolve this. So that we can leave the European Union with a deal as soon as possible. \u201cSo that we can avoid having to hold those European Parliamentary elections. And above all, so that we can fulfil the democratic decision of the referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward. \u201cThis is our national duty as elected members of this House - and nothing today is more pressing or more vital.\u201d Responding to the Prime Minister, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \"Yesterday EU leaders agreed to grant the United Kingdom an Article 50 extension until the 31st of October.",
