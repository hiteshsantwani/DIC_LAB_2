    "text": "BBC host Martha Kearney pointed out to the Independent Group politician that MPs had rejected every proposal, apart from avoiding a no deal, in the Commons. None of the Brexit alternative amendments reached a majority in the Commons on Monday evening, prompting the Prime Minister to call a mammoth Cabinet meeting to try to find a way forward. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Ms Kearney quizzed Ms Soubry as the Independent Group voted against Ken Clarke\u2019s proposal for a permanent customs union.\nThe host said: \u201cYou have had two days now of indicative votes and MPs have completely failed to unite around any kind of compromise.\u201d The MP for Broxtowe said she did \u201cnot accept\u201d that analysis, saying: \u201cWe have made progress in a days worth of debate than two years of this Government.\u201d The BBC presenter Kearney snapped back: \u201cBut, all the votes have been lost haven\u2019t they. \u201cNo single option has come forward. You have rejected everything.\nBrexit news: Martha Kearney clashed with Anna Soubry over the Brexit stalemate\nAll the votes have been lost haven\u2019t they Martha Kearney\n\u201cThe only thing that MPs are agreeing on is that they don\u2019t want no deal.\u201d During the BBC interview, the Independent Group MP outlined why they did not back the customs union amendment which was rejected by a majority of three votes. Ms Soubry said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t deliver the regulatory alignment which is needed for the frictionless trade. \u201cI made that very clear point to Ken last week and I made it again last night.\u201d The Prime Minister and her senior ministers met on Tuesday morning after MPs failed to find a majority for any Brexit alternative. A call for a customs union with the EU was rejected by just three votes, while demand for a second referendum was defeated by 12 and a Norway-style deal put forward by Nick Boles by 21.",
