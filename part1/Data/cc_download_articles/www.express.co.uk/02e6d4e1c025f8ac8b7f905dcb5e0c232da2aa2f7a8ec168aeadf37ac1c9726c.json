    "text": "Iain Anderson, an expert in global political risk, said the \u201creal story\u201d to have emerged following the European Union\u2019s decision to add a six-month delay to Brexit, is the bloc\u2019s newfound willingness to reopen Brexit talks. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Brexicast podcast on Thursday evening, Mr Anderson said: \u201cI think we are going into these European elections \u2013 that\u2019s my calculation at the minute. But that this bespoke idea \u2013 it is being talked about in the UK it is clearly also being talked about in Brussels right now \u2013 frankly, we have entered a new dynamic.\nThe real story that has emerged is this possibility of the whole thing being opened up again Iain Anderson\n\u201cAs Katya said earlier, people are sort of focussing on Macron versus Merkel, I think that\u2019s a Government completely right. It is a total sideshow. \u201cThe real story that has just emerged in the past 20 hours or so, since the early hours of this morning, is this possibility of the whole thing being opened up again.\u201d When asked by BBC Europe editor Katya Adler whether he was referring to both the withdrawal agreement and backstop, Mr Anderson replied: \u201cVery possibly. Whispered tones about that starting to emerge.\u201d But the BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming insisted \u201cthey are whispering because it is not going to happen\u201d.\nBrexit news: EU could reopen Brexit deal, says politics expert\nMs Adler continued: \u201cI cannot imagine that EU countries would say \u2018forget it, we don\u2019t want to talk about it\u2019.\u201d The public affairs consultant insisted Ms Adler was \u201cexactly right\u201d in saying the EU could reopen talks. But she continued and said the EU will demand \u201crealistic and workable proposals\u201d, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s not, for example, the Malthouse Compromise.\u201d Mr Anderson replied: \u201cI am getting in front of a whole bunch of folk right now and I\u2019ve seen more movement and possibilities in the past week to ten days than I think we have seen in the last two years.\u201d But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg insisted there is unlikely to be an agreement reached between the Tories and Labour, which would open the door to a Brexit renegotiation. Ms Kuenssberg said: \u201cThat\u2019s really interesting because at the moment, talking to people who have been involved in the cross-party talks, I just find it really hard to see how they are ever going to get there. \u201cSomeone who has been in the talks said \u2018the thing is, the more we talk, the more it reveals how big the scale of the task is\u2019. \u201cBecause it wouldn\u2019t just be about getting the withdrawal agreement through.\u201d",
