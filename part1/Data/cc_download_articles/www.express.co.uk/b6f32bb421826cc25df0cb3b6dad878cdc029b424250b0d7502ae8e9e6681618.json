    "text": "Toulouse are looking to win the Champions Cup\nThe big hitters all bring something different to the feast and in a season of English under-achievement Saracens\u2019 refusal to lower the flag should be applauded but it is the presence of Toulouse which completes the whole. At a time when the last rites have been read to the French national team, the green shoots bursting out from the country\u2019s most charismatic club side signify that French rugby is not dead after all. That it is Toulouse who provide the pulse is a fact worthy of wider appreciation. This is the club who won the inaugural European Cup in 1996, the first of three triumphs in the tournament\u2019s first decade. Another followed in 2010 with two other trips to the final thrown in during a golden period under Guy Noves too. It was not just the success though it was the shaft of light Toulouse brought to Europe with their intoxicating blend of power and movement.\nThey were the one French club to see the big picture and place Europe on a pedestal above the annual hunt for the Bouclier de Brennus in the domestic league and what style they brought to the party. Their subsequent decline as Toulon\u2019s more muscular interpretation of what French rugby should look like took over on the European stage left a hole. Toulouse missed out on qualification for the Champions Cup for the first time last season and were left forlornly peddling their wares in the second-tier Challenge Cup. It was like seeing Tom Jones on at the Dog and Duck. But this season, reignited by a troupe of largely home-grown youngsters brought through their own academy, the entertainers are back.\nCheslin Kolbe is up for European player of the year\nToulouse\u2019s performance in an extraordinary quarterfinal against Racing on Sunday with 14 men after the dismissal of Zach Holmes was a thing of wonder. Lucas Tauzin\u2019s no-look offload for Maxime Medard\u2019s try belonged to The Magic Circle not Paris\u2019s La Defense Arena. Scrum-half Antoine Dupont is on the shortlist for European player of the season as is Toulouse\u2019s South African wing Cheslin Kolbe. Under the club\u2019s former wing Ugo Mola, who is assisted by two other Toulouse old boys in William Servat and Jean Bouilhou, Toulouse have rediscovered their essence. They have lost only once since September - to their upcoming semifinal opponents Leinster in the group stage but beat the defending champions in the south of France in round two.\nSaracens\u2019 semifinal against Munster on Easter Saturday will be a monumental arm wrestle, a brutalist contest where structure and suffocation will be the order of the day. In its own way it will be an absorbing clash of like v like but Leinster against Toulouse could be a piece of art. Leinster can play a bit of rugby themselves - their 52-3 destruction of Wasps in round one was a sight to behold \u2013 and if they decide to let the brake off and see which team can outrun the other, the Aviva Stadium could witness a game for the ages. The venue will play into the Irish province\u2019s hands. Given how often Leinster and their Irish internationals play there it is effectively a home tie. But even if Toulouse\u2019s involvement in this season\u2019s tournament ends in Dublin it has been invigorating to see the coolest cats in European rugby purring once more. Meanwhile, on the international scene, Ireland have lost flanker Dan Leavy for the World Cup after scans revealed he sustained serious knee ligament damage on Saturday.\nToulouse are looking to win this year\\'s Champions Cup\nLeavy was taken from the field on a stretcher after being hurt in Leinster\u2019s Champions Cup quarterfinal tie against Ulster and Joe Schmidt\u2019s worst fears were realised on Monday. \u201cHe has been ruled out for the remainder of the season and into next season to include the Rugby World Cup,\u201d said a Leinster spokesman. Leavy, 24, also missed this season\u2019s Six Nations through injury. His stand-in Josh van der Flier is out for the rest of the season with a groin injury sustained against France. Ryan Crotty is the latest All Black to join the post-World Cup exodus with the centre confirming on Monday he is leaving the Crusaders to join Kubota Spears after the tournament.\nSopoaga is set to return for the wasps after missing three games with a hand injury",
