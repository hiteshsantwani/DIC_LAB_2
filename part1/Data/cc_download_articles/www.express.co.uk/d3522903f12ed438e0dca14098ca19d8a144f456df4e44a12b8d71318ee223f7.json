    "text": "After hours of intense debate, EU leaders agreed Brexit will now be delayed until October 31 with a review to happen at the June 21 European Council summit. Following the talks, Czech prime minister Andrej Babi\u0161 outlined his wish to stop Brexit on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme. Mr Babi\u0161 said: \u201cMe, personally, I hope you will stay in the EU finally. Maybe we will have elections and a second referendum, I don\u2019t know.\nI hope you will stay in the EU finally\n\u201cIt\u2019s my own personal wish. It\u2019s very negative for the EU that you are leaving.\u201d\nBBC host Nick Robinson asked the Czech prime minister whether he hopes the British people will change their minds on Brexit.\nIn response, Mr Babi\u0161 chuckled and said: \u201cYou have to think I have a clear position. The British people have to think about the future of your country.\u201d\nThe Brexit delay will still see Britain forced to hold European Parliament elections on May 23 as one of the guarantees demanded by Brussels.\nBritain will be expected to leave the bloc by June 1 if the country fails to participate in the EU elections.\nPrime Minister of Slovakia Peter Pellegrini has also said the extension would allow Britain to have a second referendum.\nMr Pellegrini said: \u201cI think now we gave Great Britain a chance and enough time to make some final decision and to say to citizens in the United Kingdom and also in the whole of Europe, \u2018what is the future of our future relationship?\u2019\u201d",
