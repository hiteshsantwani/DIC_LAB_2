    "text": "Mark Francois was making the comments while he was on BBC Newsnight\nSpeaking on BBC Newsnight, Mr Francois waved off claims his European Research Group (ERG) had killed off Brexit by refusing to back Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s deal. On Monday night, royal assent was given to the bill that would rule out a no deal Brexit and give more time for negotiations to continue with the EU on how the UK will leave. But the ERG has been accused of jeopardising Brexit by repeatedly voting against Mrs May\u2019s deal, a move some believe could halt the UK ever leaving the EU.\nFarage and his Brexit party will \u2018RISE like a PHOENIX\u2019 in election\nWhen quizzed by the BBC One show\u2019s host Emily Maitlis about whether the bill would mean no deal would be off the cards, he was defiant.\nHe said: \u201cNo. The bill doesn\u2019t actually prevent a no deal.\n\u201cIt depends on the European Council. The bill gives the Prime Minister a mandate to suggest a date for an extension, but it doesn\u2019t force the EU to agree.\n\u201cBoth sides have to agree the extension.\nREAD MORE: Public WANT to leave on WTO terms says Lord",
