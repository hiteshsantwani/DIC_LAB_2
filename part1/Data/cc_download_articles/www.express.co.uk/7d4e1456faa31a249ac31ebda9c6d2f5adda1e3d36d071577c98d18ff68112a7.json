    "text": "Jacob Rees-Mogg was quizzed on BBC\u2019s Today programme about retweeting a video of German AfD co-leader Alice Weidel speaking in Germany\u2019s parliament about Brexit. The far-right AfD is Germany\u2019s main opposition party and has campaigned for tougher immigration controls. In response, Jacob Rees-Mogg claimed it was \u201ctypical\u201d of the Today programme to ask him about the tweet as he brought up BBC radio presenter James Naughtie who apologised after comparing the European Research Group to France\u2019s National Front.\nSpeaking on Today, BBC\u2019s Mishal Husain said: \u201cI want to ask you about what you did the other day in retweeting and drawing attention to something which the AfD put out. \u201cI know you have been asked about this quite a few times. And you have said so far that you don\u2019t agree with everything that they stand for but you wanted to draw attention to this. \u201cYou have nevertheless chosen to shine a spotlight on a party whose core principles are anti-immigration and anti-Islam, whose leader in the German Parliament views include Germany being overrun by Arabs and Roma. \u201cIs there nothing in that which gives you pause for thought, that at least you should clarify when you put out and say that you don\u2019t support their other beliefs?\u201d\nBBC\\'s Mishal Husain clashed with Jacob Rees-Mogg on Today\nMr Rees-Mogg replied: \u201cWell, I think this is typical of the BBC\u2019s obsession, dare I say it, the Today programme\u2019s obsession about this. \u201cMr Naughtie quite shamefully said the other week that the ERG was like the National Front in France. He said it himself, it was his view. He is a BBC person, he is paid by the license fee.\u201d The BBC presenter stepped in demanding Mr Rees-Mogg answer the question, enraging the Conservative Party Brexiteer. The Tory MP said: \u201cI am coming to the question. You must be patient and not interrupt so much because the answer needs to be given properly. \u201cThe BBC does have this obsession. What Mr Naughtie said was an outrageous slur and he wasn\u2019t challenged by whoever was interviewing him. That wasn\u2019t raised.\u201d\nThat to me seems typical of the Today programme\u2019s leftie approach Jacob Rees-Mogg\nMs Husain claimed the remark from Mr Naughtie was not \u201chis view\u201d, before Mr Rees-Mogg added: \u201cWell it was a view he expressed. \u201cWhen Mr Naughtie quotes someone, and it is not his view, that\u2019s fine. When I quote somebody and it is not my view, that\u2019s a great shock. \u201cThat to me seems typical of the Today programme\u2019s leftie approach. An obsession with this issue.\u201d Mr Rees-Mogg posted a video on Sunday of the German AfD co-leader Alice Weidel speaking in Germany\\'s parliament. Alongside the video, the Tory MP wrote: \"The AfD leader asks \\'Is it any wonder the British see bad faith behind every manoeuvre from Brussels?\\'\"\nLabour MP for Tottenham David Lammy responded to the Tweet, claiming Mr Rees-Mogg was \u201cpromoting Germany\\'s overtly racist party, AfD\". He wrote: \u201cJacob Rees-Mogg promoting Germany\\'s overtly racist party, AfD. Our country\\'s proudest moment was defeating the far-right. Now we are supposed to sit back while xenophobes, nativists, nationalists & isolationists do their best to tear Europe apart again. We must not let them win.\u201d Speaking on LBC on Monday, Rees-Mogg said: \u201cI\\'m not supporting the AfD. But this is a speech in the Bundestag of real importance because it shows a German view of Brexit.\u201d In March, BBC host James Naughtie sparked fury and apologised after likening members of the ERG to France\u2019s National Front.",
