    "text": "Lewis Hamilton has hailed Ayrton Senna ahead of Formula One\\'s 1000th meeting\nThe Chinese Grand Prix will bring up 1000 F1 races in motorsport\\'s premier competition. Hamilton is hoping to follow up on his Bahrain victory to leapfrog Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas to the top of the Drivers\u2019 Championship. The Brit was asked to reflect on the most memorable race of his lifetime. And watching his late hero in action at Donington, where he overtook four drivers including the legendary Michael Schumacher on the opening lap, stood head and shoulders above the rest.\n\u201cI think everyone knows I was inspired by Ayrton Senna, and that\u2019s where a lot of my passion for F1 came from,\u201d Hamilton told the Chinese Grand Prix race programme. \u201cI started watching Formula 1 with my dad when I was just four or five years old. I loved cars. \u201cAt the time, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost were the leaders of the pack and they immediately caught my attention. \u201cI would come home from school and quite often put on a video of Ayrton Senna. I wanted to be him. I aspired to drive the way he drove, and to achieve something similar to what he achieved.\nAyrton Senna won the 1993 European Grand Prix\n\u201cAnd Ayrton\u2019s great races would be among my favourites. You think of the amazing performances in Monaco. \u201cBut the one that obviously stands out for everyone is his incredible first lap of Donington, in the wet, at the European Grand Prix in 1993. \u201cIt was just phenomenal to watch.\u201d Hamilton\u2019s own personal favourites come from his five Championship-winning drives.\nLewis Hamilton won the Bahrain Grand Prix last time out",
