    "text": "Nigel Farage claimed he was \u201cabsolutely\u201d sure Brexit would be delivered after a Sky News host asked him if \u201chis vision had died\u201d. Mr Farage also said the longer extension allowed the British people go to out and vote in European elections and show their frustration. Speaking on Sky News, host Isabel Webster, said: \u201cJust the very fact we are talking about delays to Brexit, down that in many ways mean that Brexit is over really.\n\u201cThat it is a pipe dream, that your vision has died now.\u201d Mr Farage replied: \u201cWell, let\u2019s be frank, the Prime Minister and most people in the Houses of Parliament have done their best to try to kill Brexit stone dead. \u201cThey have done it by endlessly kicking the can down the road. \u201cBut, what they haven\u2019t noticed is the growing anger in this country, and not just among Leave voters, a lot of Remain voters are saying \u2018what kind country are we if we don\u2019t keep to our democratic principles\u2019.\u201d\nBrexit news: Nigel Farage delivered an epic response after being told his vision had \\'died\\'\nSo, do I think Brexit will happen? Absolutely Nigel Farage\nHe added: \u201cThe world is looking on astonished at what has happened to our nation. \u201cSo, do I think Brexit will happen? Absolutely, I think Brexit will happen. \u201cI think the genie is out of the bottle, I just fear there are more battles to fight until we get there\u201d. Mr Farage claimed the \u201cone good thing\u201d about extending Article 50 further is \u201cit gives the British people the opportunity on May 23 in a European election to express their view.\u201d\nOn Friday, Mrs May wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to Article 50 until June 30. The Prime Minister said she will seek to ratify her withdrawal agreement before the European Parliament elections on May 23, but will make \"responsible preparations\" to take part if that does not prove possible. In her letter, she wrote: \"I am writing, therefore, to inform the European Council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty. \"The United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June 2019. If the parties are able to ratify before this date, the Government proposes that the period should be terminated early. \"The Government will want to agree a timetable for ratification that allows the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union before 23 May 2019 and therefore cancel the European Parliament elections, but will continue to make responsible preparations to hold the elections should this not prove possible.\" Mrs May said if ongoing talks with Labour do not lead to a \"single unified approach soon\" then the Government would instead look to establish a \"consensus\" on options on a future relationship that could be put to the Commons.",
