Guess what? We are still members of the European Union. Despite the fact, we were supposed to be leaving. \u201cThe Prime Minister telling us over 100 times we would leave. 500 MPs voting for us to leave on that day, with or without a deal. \u201cI have to say, for me, I think this is one of the saddest, worst episodes in the history of our country. \u201cI fear that our democracy is dying and our faith in our whole electoral system, our governmental system, I think it is a bad moment.\u201d\nBrexit news: Nigel Farage delivered a passionate speech seconds into his radio show\nI have to say, for me, I think this is one of the saddest, worst episodes in the history of our country Nigel Farage\nAfter her plan was rejected by MPs, by 344 votes to 286, the Prime Minister warned she feared \u201cwe are reaching the limits of this process in this House\u201d.
