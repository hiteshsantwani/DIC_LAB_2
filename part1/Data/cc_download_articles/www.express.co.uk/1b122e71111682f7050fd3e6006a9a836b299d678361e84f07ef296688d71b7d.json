    "text": "A BBC Question Time audience member snapped at the Remain backing MP claiming a second Brexit vote would be \u201cundemocratic\u201d. Mr Lammy has repeatedly demanded a People\u2019s Vote and delivered a speech at last months anti-Brexit march. Speaking on Question Time, the audience member claimed the UK would be playing a \u201cdangerous game\u201d if it advocated another referendum.\nThe Question Time audience member said: \u201cLet\u2019s put Brexit aside for one moment. A lot of things that have been said on the panel are sounding slightly undemocratic. \u201cWe have had the largest turn out ever in British politics where 17.4million people voted to the simple question of \u2018Remain in the EU\u2019 or \u2018Leave in the EU\u2019. \u201cThe dangerous game we are playing here is you are going against the will of the people and to even mention a second referendum Mr Lammy is just undemocratic.\u201d The Labour MP for Tottenham tried interrupting as he shouted out, \u201cno it\u2019s not\u201d.\nBBC Question Time audience member ripped in Labour\\'s David Lammy over Brexit\nA lot of things that have been said on the panel are sounding slightly undemocratic BBC QT audience member\nThe BBC Question Time audience member replied: \u201cHold on. Hear me out. Hear me out. \u201cIf we go to the next election and we are not too happy with the result because Labour got in or another party got in, what do we do? \u201cOh, \u2018let\u2019s put it back to the people\u2019, I am not happy. Best out of three, best out of five, best out of ten.\u201d He added: \u201cBefore we had democracy, does anyone recall the system we had before democracy? It was violence.\n\u201cThe majority rule came in, you accept what the majority say because otherwise, people won\u2019t follow any rules.\u201d This week the Prime Minister has been meeting with the Labour Party leader after Theresa May reached out to Jeremy Corbyn to help try and get Britain\u2019s exit from the EU over the line. The move from the Prime Minister enraged a number of Conservative Party colleagues with some in the Tory party\u2019s European Research Group calling for Mrs May to step down. Discussions around a second Brexit vote have taken place, and Ministers have considered the possibility of giving MPs a vote on holding a referendum on a deal as part of the talks with Labour, the Daily Telegraph reported.",
