    "text": "Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer, who succeeded Angela Merkel as party leader, warned that Britain\u2019s turbulent departure from the EU should silence European campaigns to quit the Brussels project. The new CDU leader is attempting to use Brexit to quash eurosceptic movements in her own country ahead of the European Parliament elections. She accused Theresa May for allowing the British Government\u2019s agenda to be hijacked by populists.\nPro-European candidates fear that Brexit and the UK\u2019s continued presence in the EU could wreak havoc to their campaigns ahead of the May vote. In an interview with Germany\u2019s Welt am Sonntag newspaper, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer said: \u201cIt should be clear to everyone what happens when the populists can set the agenda. \u201cThere are also parties in Germany that support leaving the EU. \u201cEveryone can see in the example of Britain what consequences that would have.\u201d\nAngela Merkel successor Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (L) says Brexit is an example to eurosceptics\nHer comments were echoed by Germany\u2019s European affairs minister Michael Roth, who described the Brexit negotiations as a \u201cs***show\u201d. In an undiplomatic attack on Britain, he said: \u201cBrexit is a big s***show, I say that now very undiplomatically.\u201d He also suggested \u201c90 percent\u201d Mrs May\u2019s Cabinet have \u201cno idea how workers think, live, work and behave\u201d and politicians \u201cborn with silver spoons in their mouths, who went to private schools and elite universities\u201d won\u2019t suffer the consequences. MPs will attempt to seize control of Brexit this evening in a second attempt to challenge Mrs May\\'s controversial EU withdrawal deal.\nPoliticians will vote on, depending on the Speaker John Bercow\u2019s choices, up to nine alternative Brexit options. Included in the current list a second referendum, remaining in the EU\u2019s customs union and the so-called \u2018Common Market 2.0\u2019 approach, which would see the UK remain in the single market with a complex customs arrangement. Any of tonight\u2019s winners could be pitched against the Prime Minister in a fourth vote on her Brexit deal tomorrow. Downing Street will likely confirm its own plans after the indicative votes scheduled for around 8pm tonight. Liz Truss, chief secretary to the Treasury, claimed \"it\\'s not clear something like a customs union actually commands support\". Remainer MPs would crash Mrs May\\'s Government if they force the Prime Minister to pursue a customs union.",
