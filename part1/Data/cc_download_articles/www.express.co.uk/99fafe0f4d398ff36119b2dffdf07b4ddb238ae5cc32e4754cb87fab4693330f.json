    "text": "Jacob Rees-Mogg has claimed the UK should \u201cbe very difficult\u201d and frustrate the EU should there be a lengthy Brexit delay. The Conservative MP for North East Somerset said the UK would have the opportunity to \u201cveto\u201d the European Union\u2019s budget and halt French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s plans for \u201cfurther deep integration\u201d. Speaking to Sophy Ridge, the Chairman of the Tory party\u2019s eurosceptic European Research Group claimed the UK should become the \u201cmost difficult member possible\u201d if Brexit is delayed even further.\nJacob Rees-Mogg said: \u201cThe greatest reason being the potential to split up the United Kingdom at the behest of the EU, which is why I said last week that if we are forced to Remain in, we should be the most difficult member possible. \u201cI don\u2019t think the EU and its jargon has behaved towards us with sincere cooperation. I don\u2019t think sincere cooperation could possibly include trying to break up the unity of a member state when it leaves the European Union. \u201cTherefore I think we are no longer obliged to follow sincere cooperation in return. When the Multiannual Financial Framework comes forward, if we are still in, this is our one in seven-year opportunity to veto the budget and to really be very difficult. \u201cAnd I hope that any British Prime Minister would take that opportunity.\u201d\nBrexit news: Jacob Rees-Mogg urged the UK to frustrate the EU if long Brexit delay\nWe should be the most difficult member possible Jacob Rees-Mogg\nWhen asked what he meant by being as \u201cdisruptive as possible\u201d, Mr Rees-Mogg replied: \u201cMany things now are taken over by qualified majority vote, and there is nothing we can do about it. \u201cIn terms of the budget, each annual budget is set by majority voting, but the seven-year budgetary framework requires unanimity and therefore we could veto that. \u201cWe would also be able to stop Mr Macron\u2019s plans for further deep integration because they would almost certainly require treaty change, so as they start to progress, if we were still a member, we would be able to stop them. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to stop further integration, and trying to make ensure that it does not cost us any more money. \u201cThese would be things that were not just difficult for their own sake but were also in the British national interest if we were still a member state.\u201d\nBrexit news: Theresa May has asked the EU for a further Brexit delay until the end of June\nOn Friday, Mr Rees-Mogg tweeted: \u201cIf a long extension leaves us stuck in the EU we should be as difficult as possible. \u201cWe could veto any increase in the budget, obstruct the putative EU army and block Mr Macron\u2019s integrationist schemes.\u201d Responding to the remark on Twitter, the European Parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt, wrote: \u201cFor those in the EU who may be tempted to further extend the Brexit saga, I can only say, be careful what you wish for.\u201d Prime Minister Theresa May wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to the Article 50 process until June 30. The Prime Minister said she will seek to ratify her withdrawal agreement before the European Parliament elections on May 23, but will make \"responsible preparations\" to take part if that does not prove possible.",
