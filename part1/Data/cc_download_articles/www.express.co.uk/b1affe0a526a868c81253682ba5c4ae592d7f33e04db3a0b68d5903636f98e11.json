    "text": "Brexit support and Member of the Welsh Assembly Conservative Group, Mark Reckless insisted the UK should not have signed up to the EU\u2019s sequencing of negotiations, which put Britain on the back foot from the start. Former Conservative Party MP, Mr Reckless, who joined Ukip in 2014, said the decision to sign up to the EU\u2019s sequencing of Brexit negotiations was \u201ccompletely ridiculous\u201d. Mr Reckless also claimed the Prime Minister \u201chad the wool pulled over her eyes\u201d with the controversial backstop mechanism within the withdrawal agreement.\nHe told Express.co.uk: \u201cWe should never have agreed to the sequencing of agreeing on money, and I think citizens rights is non-consensus, but agreeing on money before agreeing to a trade deal. \u201cIt\u2019s completely ridiculous trying to agree what the arrangements should be for trade and administering the Northern Irish border in advance of the trade deal. \u201cBecause what the arrangements are for that, fall out of what our trade agreement is with the European Union, as long as we come to a reasonable agreement and there is goodwill on both sides, I am sure we would. \u201cThen that should mean we don\u2019t need to see a hard border or any sort of infrastructure on the Northern Ireland border, that is completely unnecessary as the Irish themselves accepted earlier in the process, as they have accepted now in terms of planning for no deal and not having it if we don\u2019t have an agreement.\u201d\nBrexit news: Mark Reckless pointed out May\\'s crucial mistake in negotiations\nThe politicians need to deliver for the people and if they don\u2019t I don\u2019t know what will happen next Brexiteer Mark Reckless\nMr Reckless added: \u201cI think that the issue of the Irish backstop has been exploited and used in order to try and frustrate the will of the British people for Brexit. \u201cI think that is unacceptable, and I think the Prime Minister has gone along with that or had the wool pulled over her eyes, in the way that no British Prime Minister should have done.\u201d Commenting on the state of negotiations, Mr Reckless said: \u201cWe said that we were going to leave on March 29 and the Prime Minister said that over 100 times in the Commons and we are not doing that. \u201cI don\u2019t think people in Westminster understand how much people outside will feel betrayed by that, and I don\u2019t use that word lightly. \u201cThe politicians need to deliver for the people and if they don\u2019t I don\u2019t know what will happen next. It is not the country I thought we were as a democracy.\u201d\nThis week the Prime Minister has been meeting with the Labour Party leader after Theresa May reached out to Jeremy Corbyn to help try and get Britain\u2019s exit from the EU over the line. The move from the Prime Minister enraged a number of Conservative Party colleagues with some in the Tory party\u2019s European Research Group calling for Mrs May to step down. On Wednesday MPs also voted to seek a delay to Brexit rather than risk the UK crashing out of the bloc on April 12, which was passed by 313 votes to 312. The Bill is currently being debated in the House of Lords and peers are scheduled to return to the Chamber on Monday before voting, where it is expected to be passed for Royal Assent.",
