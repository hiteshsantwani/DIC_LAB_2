    "text": "The extreme weather will hit the continent on Thursday when two Atlantic fronts will bring heavy rain to Italy and the UK as well as heavy snow to parts of Spain and the Italian Alps. Low pressure will contribute to warm air from north-Africa to reach the continent from the south at the same time, causing a meteorological clash that could cause some severe avalanches. BBC Weather forecaster Susan Powell said: \u201cWe\u2019re still looking at a very mobile weather pattern to western European at the moment with areas of low pressure barrelling from the Atlantic pulling a lot of warm air from the south across the Mediterranean.\n\u201cStirring quite a bit of dust across northern Africa. \u201cSome wet weather piling into northern Italy on Thursday, some heavy snow on the Alps and the mild air close by will mean an increased risk of avalanches. \u201cIt\u2019s still looking very stormy across the north-west. Some heavy rain as well for Sicily and much of Italy, Sardinia and Corsica. \u201cRain for northern Portugal and showers feeding across France and across the UK.\u201d On Friday, Spain and Portugal will also experience some heavy snow on their respective northern hills. In the UK, The Met Office has also issued a yellow snow warning for Southern Scotland and Northern England following winds from the Arctic.\nBBC Weather forecast: Europe braces for heavy snow and risk of avalanches\nSome heavy snow on the Alps and the mild air close by will mean an increased risk of avalanches Susan Powell\nThe warning also indicated the possibility of travel disruption in this area, however by the evening commute transport should return to normal. Met Office Meteorologist Aidan McGivern said: \u201cFrequent showers across much of the UK with hail, thunder and even some snow mixed in. \u201cIt will, of course, be another cold day and there will be more persistent wind and rain with hill snow as we start the day. \u201cGales across northern and eastern parts of Scotland and you can see this band of wet weather across western parts of Scotland. \u201cSnow especially over the hills but even some snow coming down to lower levels as we start off Wednesday. \u201cMaybe some slushy bits and pieces for Edinburgh and Dundee for example as Scotland has unpleasant conditions.\u201d",
