    "text": "BBC\u2019s Europe Editor Katya Adler has claimed some EU leaders could be ready to grant the UK another short extension to try to get Brexit over the line. Reports suggest European Council President Donald Tusk favours a longer extension, of around a year, with the option to cut the delay short if a Brexit deal is agreed. Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show, BBC\u2019s Europe Editor Adler claimed if there is a longer extension \u201cEU leaders worry this could just go on forever\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cAt the emergency Brexit summit on Wednesday in Brussels, all the 27EU leaders will first listen to Theresa May. \u201cShe will then be asked to leave the room while they discuss what to do about her extension request. \u201cVery importantly they have to come to a unanimous decision under EU law and fireworks are predicted, whether it\u2019s a massive display or just a regular one, we don\u2019t quite know at the moment. \u201cBasically the Prime Minister has asked for another extension ending at the end of June, there are EU leaders at the moment who say \u2018well you know what, the advantage to that is it would keep MPs under pressure\u2019.\nBBC\\'s Katya Adler claimed some EU leaders may favour a short Brexit delay\n\u201cBecause if it is a short extension, they have to come to a decision, and based on past performance, EU leaders worry this could just go on forever. You have a longer extension and everybody will just go round and round.\u201d She added: \u201cThey are really fed up with this process, they are not really fed up with the United Kingdom, and I think that\u2019s really important to distinguish. \u201cSome leaders are now saying, \u2018might the UK change its mind\u2019, but whatever happens if we leave it is in the EU\u2019s interest, socially, economically and politically to keep us as close as possible and keep relations as close as possible. \u201cThose who see a longer extension would be a good idea, so you have got Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council, he is calling for this so-called \u2018flextension\u2019, so it is a longer extension, but we can get out once a Brexit deal has been ratified. \u201cThen it comes to Emmanuel Macron who has been saying loud and clear, \u2018do not take any extension for granted because you Theresa May have to come to us with a very clear plan\u2019. Again, a slight health warning on this. He said it last time and I think just when the Prime Minister speaks or Jeremy Corbyn, they are speaking to their own audiences.\u201d\nThere are EU leaders at the moment who say \u2018well you know what, the advantage to that is it would keep MPs under pressure\u2019 Katya Adler\nOn Sunday the Prime Minister delivered a video message from her Chequers country retreat on delivering the result of the 2016 referendum. Mrs May said: \"There are lots of things on which I disagree with the Labour Party on policy issues. \"But on Brexit I think there are some things we agree on: ending free movement, ensuring we leave with a good deal, protecting jobs, protecting security. \"And so we are talking. Can we find a way through this that ensures that we can get a good deal and a deal agreed through Parliament? \"It\\'ll mean compromise on both sides but I believe that delivering Brexit is the most important thing for us.\" The Prime Minister wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to the Article 50 process until June 30. She said she will seek to ratify her withdrawal agreement before the European Parliament elections on May 23, but will make \"responsible preparations\" to take part if that does not prove possible. Reports suggest Mr Tusk is recommending a longer postponement of one year, with a break clause in the case of earlier ratification, in a so-called \"flextension\" deal.",
