    "text": "The Ukip leader and MEP shocked the European Parliament with his speech in which he ridiculed European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker and Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier for working with Remainer \u201ctraitors\u201d in Britain to scupper Brexit. During a fiery European Parliament speech, the MEP said the Brexit vote is \u201cthe only weapon the ordinary people have\u201d as he urged Britons to vote for his party in EU elections. Mr Batten said: \u201cHas the whole Brexit process fiasco been an elaborate conspiracy between Mrs May and the EU or is it just due to her monumental incompetence?\nBy all means ban me and watch my vote go up in the United Kingdom Gerard Batten\n\u201cEither way we have to hand it to you Mr Juncker and Mr Barnier \u2013 you have done what Philip of Spain, what Napoleon, what Kaiser Wilhelm and Hitler couldn\u2019t do. \u201cYou have brought Britain to its knees without firing a single shot.\u201d SNP MEP Alyn Smith branded Mr Batten\u2019s speech a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and was greeted with a round of applause as he told MEPs: \u201cHe does not speak for the people of the United Kingdom. \u201cHe barely speaks for his own party such as it still exists. \u201cTo use that sort of rhetoric in this house of democracy utterly shameful.\nBrexit news: Gerard Batten says his vote will soar if he is banned from European Parliament\n\u201cCan I suggest that you and the presidency think whether or not this house should continue to give a platform to these to recurse for their poison. Thank you.\u201d In response, Vice President of the European Parliament Mairead McGuinness shut down the MEP\u2019s attempts to respond and said: \u201cExcuse me, Mr Batten, I have the microphone and I will speak and then I may allow you to speak. \u201cCan I say that I will definitely bring your issue to the president? I was also concerned about the use of another term, punishment beating, I find that a difficult term in the context of my own country. Sir, do you have a point?\u201d Mr Batten then was given the microphone and roared: \u201cThis gentleman represents the party it claims it wants independence and yet it is happy to be subservient to the European Union.\u201d The British MEP then raised his voice once more and shouted: \u201cBy all means ban me and watch my vote go up in the United Kingdom.\u201d Britain is set to leave the EU without a deal on April 12 but leaders will convene with Theresa May days before in an attempt to negotiate another Brexit delay.",
