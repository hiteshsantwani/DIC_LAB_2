    "text": "Brexit news: John Humphrys clashed with Bruno Bonnell over a Brexit delay\nTheresa May wrote to EU Council President on Friday asking for a Brexit delay until June 30 but wants to terminate any extension before the European polls if she is able to get a deal through Parliament. The Prime Minister is currently engaged in EU talks with the Labour Party after she reached out to Jeremy Corbyn to try to deliver Brexit, sparking fury among MPs in the Conservative Party\u2019s eurosceptic European Research Group. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, an MP for En Marche! Bruno Bonnell, claimed France would not accept another short extension but would be open to the idea of a longer delay.\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a no, a no for many reasons. First one being we have been giving some delays so far, with no result. \u201cThere is such a misunderstanding here in France, about the attitude of the UK Parliament, we just don\u2019t understand what they are doing, so why would we give more time for a dead end at this point? \u201cWe have to accept that a no deal might be the option.\u201d BBC host John Humphrys stepped in asking what if the Prime Minister asked for a longer delay. He said: \u201cWhat if she were to say instead, let\u2019s have one year, two years, five years, what would you say then.\u201d\nIt\u2019s either a long delay like beyond five years, or it is a very short delay to clarify the situation Bruno Bonnell\nMr Bonnell replied: \u201cThat would be different. My point was, why don\u2019t we give another week, like last call before next Wednesday\u2019s meeting, so we can have a perspective signature of this treaty. \u201cOr we effectively give five years. We welcome in UK representatives at the European Parliament to prove that we can change the EU Parliament and therefore there will be a reevaluation later on. \u201cIt\u2019s either a long delay like beyond five years, or it is a very short delay to clarify the situation.\u201d The BBC presenter responded saying: \u201cOf course, a really long delay would be utterly unacceptable to a huge number of people in this country.\u201d The French MP said he \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d what the reaction would be in the UK. He said: \u201cI have seen very conflicting opinions.\n\u201cWe have seen 6 million people plus signing a letter requesting another referendum. We have seen people who feel they have been cheated. And we have seen people that want a Brexit no matter what. \u201cFrom the European perspective, it is very confusing and probably very embarrassing at this stage that we can\u2019t get out of this situation.\u201d On Friday, Mrs May wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to Article 50 until June 30. The Prime Minister said she will seek to ratify her withdrawal agreement before the European Parliament elections on May 23, but will make \"responsible preparations\" to take part if that does not prove possible.",
