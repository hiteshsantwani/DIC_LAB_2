    "text": "Prime Minister Theresa May travelled to the EU summit in Brussels on Wednesday after sending a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk last week requesting an extension to the Article 50 process until June 30. Mr Tusk originally called for a \"flexible extension\" to Brexit lasting \"as long as necessary and no longer than one year\". Arriving in Brussels at the EU summit, Latvia\u2019s Prime Minister, Arturs Krisjanis Karins, claimed the UK has three Brexit options remaining.\nHe said: \u201cLook, the decision of what to do is up to the British Government, the British Parliament and the British people. They have really three choices. \u201cYou can always go for a no deal, you can go for a deal, that\u2019s been negotiated. \u201cAnd, there\u2019s the third option, in the end, to revoke Article 50. It\u2019s up to the British to decide.\u201d He added: \u201cThe future of Britain is in Britain\u2019s hands.\nBrexit news: Latvian PM outlined three options remaining for the UK\nThe future of Britain, is in Britain\u2019s hands Arturs Krisjanis Karins\n\u201cThe British Government is asking us for an extension. We will be discussing that this evening. \u201cI think it makes sense. If the Brits are saying they need a little bit more time to decide what they want, I don\u2019t think we should be saying no to that. \u201cI think we should be open because, in the end, we have negotiated in good faith, a withdrawal agreement, if that\u2019s what\u2019s wanted, but until now there has been no agreement if that\u2019s what is wanted from the Parliament side. Let\u2019s see.\u201d Arriving at the EU summit on Wednesday, the Prime Minister was asked if she was \u201cembarrassed\u201d about asking for an extension. Mrs May replied: \u201cI know many people will be frustrated that the summit is taking place at all because the UK should have left the EU by now. \u201cI greatly regret the fact that Parliament has not been able to pass a deal that would enable us to leave in a smooth and orderly way.\u201d She added: \u201cBut, I and the Government continue to work to find a way forward. We have been talking with the opposition and there has been serious constructive talks. They will continue tomorrow.\n\u201cThe purpose of this summit is to agree to an extension which gives us more time to agree to a deal to enable us to leave the EU in that smooth and orderly way. \u201cWhat matters I think is that I have asked for an extension to June 30, but what is important is that any extension enables us to leave at the point of which we ratify the withdrawal agreement. So we could leave on the 22 May and start to build our brighter future.\u201d Speaking in Brussels, EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that any extension to the Article 50 process \u201cmust serve a purpose\u201d. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte opened up on the division among the EU27 over the length of any extension.",
