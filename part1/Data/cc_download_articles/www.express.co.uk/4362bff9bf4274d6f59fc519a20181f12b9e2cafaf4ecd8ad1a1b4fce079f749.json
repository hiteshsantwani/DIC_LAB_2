    "text": "Prime Minister Theresa May will make a personal plea to France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron in Paris today not to veto her request for a further delay to Brexit. Mrs May will also hold talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin to try and bolster support for her request to delay Brexit until June 30. EU leaders will be under pressure to decide whether to grant Britain another delay, a decision that can be vetoed by any of the other 27 member states.\nEmmanuel Macron really has sold himself as Mr Europe and that\u2019s the message that he keeps pushing Catherine Nicholson\nBut France 24\u2019s Catherine Nicholson said the French President is set to take a hard line against the UK at an EU summit on Wednesday over fears the Brexit deadlock is destabilising the EU. She told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: \u201cEmmanuel Macron, he keeps repeating that it\u2019s Europe\u2019s interests that really has to come first here. \u201cHe really has sold himself as Mr Europe and that\u2019s the message that he keeps pushing.\u201d President Macron could demand there be no extension of the Article 50 process unless the Prime Minister signs up to binding commitments to stand aside from the EU decision-making process.\nBrexit news: Theresa May to make personal plea to Macron over extension\nWhereas Max Hoffman, who is Bureau Chief at Deutsche Welle in Brussels, said Angela Merkel is likely to be more patient than any other EU leader. Mr Hoffman added: \u201cAngela Merkel is most likely one of those willing to have the most patience with the UK Government. \u201cShe has repeatedly said that there is still time. \u201cAnd I have no doubt, just like many colleagues here in Brussels, that she will try and up until the last minute to avoid a no deal Brexit.\u201d",
