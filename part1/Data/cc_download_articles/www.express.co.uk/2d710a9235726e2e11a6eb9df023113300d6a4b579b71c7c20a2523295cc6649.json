    "text": "The furious Brexiteer demanded the European Union show \u201cmutual respect\u201d as he warned the British people are growing \u201cincreasingly angry\u201d at the lack of Brexit progress. During a passionate speech at a Bruges Group event on Tuesday, Mr Francois said: \u201cWe are generally slow to anger. Not for us, the donning of yellow jackets and setting fire to Oxford Street.\nUK must \\'look beyond EU\\' for trade growth \u2013 \\'world going GANGBUSTERS\\'\nBrexit has already gone on long enough\n\u201cBut nevertheless, we do, in our very British way, have a strong sense of fair play and what is and isn\u2019t right.\n\u201cAnd I believe that the British people are growing increasingly angry at attempts by some of their own Government, in cahoots with those in Parliament and the European Union, to essentially keep us in against our will.\u201d\nThe Brexiteer MP reiterated that Britain voted to Leave in the 2016 referendum, adding: \u201cLet\u2019s just do it.\u201d\nMr Francois concluded the speech with a stern message to the EU and said: \u201cMy earnest message to the European Council is simple. Brexit has already gone on long enough.",
