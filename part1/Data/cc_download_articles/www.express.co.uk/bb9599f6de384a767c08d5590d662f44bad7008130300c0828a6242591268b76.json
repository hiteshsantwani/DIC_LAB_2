    "text": "Valentino Dixon got a golf lesson from the great Tom Watson on his first, emotional visit to the Masters this week.\nDixon, 49, spent 27 years in prison for a crime he did not commit before he was released last year. While inside, he drew a picture of the iconic short 12th hole here and it was published in Golf Digest \u2013 and the magazine then fought successfully for his release.\n\u201cI come from a different world. For this world to embrace me means everything. I was trying to hold back the tears today,\u201d said Dixon, who is working for Golf Digest here this week.\n\u201cI\u2019m able to see things that I didn\u2019t see before. Previously, I\u2019m drawing from magazine pictures and stuff like that.\n\u201cA lot of it I recognised. This one tree that bends over, I\u2019ve drawn it so many times but just being able to see the detail in person, and the bridge and the colouring of the stone - a photograph can\u2019t capture that.\u201d",
