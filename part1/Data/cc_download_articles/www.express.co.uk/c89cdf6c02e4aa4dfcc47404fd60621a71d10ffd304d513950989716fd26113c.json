    "text": "The European Parliament Vice-President Mairead McGuinness claimed the European Union shared none of the blame - an answer met with silence from the audience - for the Brexit impasse after being quizzed on Question Time. BBC presenter Fiona Bruce asked the European Union chief if the bloc could have done more as the Prime Minister has been forced to enter talks with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to try to deliver Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc. Bruce said: \u201cOne of the criticisms of Theresa May is that she triggered Article 50 too soon, but also that was something that came from the EU.\n\u201cThe EU was not prepared to negotiate until Article 50 was triggered. That was made completely explicit. \u201cObviously there is a lot of criticism of Theresa May and her Government, does the EU share any of the responsibility for the mess we are in now, because of that?\u201d Ms McGuinness replied: \u201cFrankly, no.\u201d The host quickly interrupted: \u201cBecause if we hadn\u2019t triggered Article 50, some might argue we might have been able to reach a consensus and then trigger Article 50.\u201d\nBBC Question Time\\'s Fiona Bruce quizzed Mairead McGuinness\nThat would be disrespecting the treaty, and rules matter Mairead McGuinness\nMs McGuinness said: \u201cThat would be disrespecting the treaty, and rules matter. \u201cBefore we even get to Theresa May, David Cameron came to Europe before he had the referendum, he got concessions which he completely refused, if you like failed to communicate, and he went for a referendum that frankly I knew he couldn\u2019t win, because I didn\u2019t think he was convinced himself. \u201cThe trouble for Europe is, why you are having this conversation, we are watching, and it\u2019s not good for the European Union. \u201cWe would love you to stay, we respect your decision to leave, but we would like to know how you are going to go, and when.\n\u201cIt is profoundly sad what the UK is doing. I am an Irish Member of Parliament, we are neighbours, we are close. \u201cThe Irish issue is obviously fundamental to the withdrawal agreement, I represent all of the counties along the invisible border. There is deep upset and hurt. \u201cI think that Britain is hurting, that\u2019s how I read it. I think there is a need for strong politics and maybe brave politics as well that would say we are in such uncertainty, that is it a longer extension you need, and when is that going to be asked for, and how is that going to be delivered?\u201d Ms McGuinness added that the EU was at fault for \u201cnot taking on the Brexiteers in the European Parliament 10-years ago\u201d. She added: \u201cThat we should have done\u201d.",
