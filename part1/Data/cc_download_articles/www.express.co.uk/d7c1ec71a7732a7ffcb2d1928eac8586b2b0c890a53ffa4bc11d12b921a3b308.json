    "text": "Norbert Rottgen, chairman of the German foreign affairs committee and an ally of Angela Merkel, insisted granting Britain a longer Article 50 extension \u201cwould have been better\u201d for the EU. He claimed the French President was demanding a brief delay to benefit his own European Parliament election campaign. On Twitter, Mr Rottgen wrote: \u201cA longer Brexit extension would have been much better!\n\u201cBut Macron prioritised his own election campaign and interests over European Union. \u201cThe UK now needs to use the new deadline to either decision on the case or a political path forward. \u201cGood news: time should be sufficient for that.\u201d The German\u2019s rant comes after EU leaders agreed to delay Brexit until October 31 with a \u201creview\u201d of the process to take place at June\u2019s European Council summit.\nAngela Merkel ally hits out at Emmanuel Macron over Brexit delay row\nMr Macron was left entirely isolated in his push for a short Brexit delay, according to a senior EU official. The source said: \u201cOf the EU27, 19 member states supported a longer extension, 7 were in between and the rest went short.\u201d Donald Tusk, the European Council President, warned Mrs May not to \u201cwaste this time\u201d given to her. He refused to rule out another extension though, adding: \u201cI am too old to exclude another scenario.",
