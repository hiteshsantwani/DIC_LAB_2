    "text": "The young Brexiteer argued remaining in the European Union - should the result of a second referendum reverse that of the 2016 vote - would have significant consequences on the country\\'s status quo. Ms Westley dismissed the claim \"everything will stay the same\" if Brexit was revoked as she stressed the Brussels bloc would rapidly become a \"superstate\" under which the UK would lose its independence.\nFarage has \\'SURPRISE\\' for Remainers \u2013 \u2019this is the FIGHT BACK\\'\nShe told TalkRADIO: \u201cThis idea that somehow by staying in the EU nothing would change, it\u2019s the status quo, the EU is moving at a very quick pace towards a centralised power.\n\u201cThey\u2019re moving towards federalisation. They want to centralise tax policies, they want to centralise all sorts of things.\n\u201cThey want a European Army. It\u2019s not the status quo.\n\u201cAnd so it\u2019s really actually quite dishonest to come on the radio and say \u2018oh we can just turn back the clock and remain and everything will stay the same\u2019.\n\u201cThis country will change significantly if we stay in the EU.",
