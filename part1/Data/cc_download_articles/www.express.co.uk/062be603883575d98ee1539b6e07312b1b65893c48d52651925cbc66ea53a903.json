    "text": "Emmanuel Macron is expected to be the biggest obstacle to a smooth transition into a longer Brexit extension after the French President signalled he is not ready to agree to a delay without imposing new conditions on the UK. Theresa May travelled to Brussels on Wednesday to attend an emergency meeting with the EU27 to secure their support to postpone Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union until June 30. But addressing the press before the meeting, Mr Macron warned he will not allow Brexit to \u201cget in the way\u201d of the European project.\nBrexiteer delivers brutal ONE-WORD response to what May should do next\nBBC Kuenssberg STUNS May with brutal question \u2013 \\'Are you embarrassed?\\'\nWe have a European renaissance to carry out and I don\u2019t want Brexit to prevent us going onwards\nThe French leader said: \u201cI come to this emergency summit with some simple principles.\n\u201cThe first principle is that we have a European project. It\u2019s been 34 months since the UK referendum was held ad the key for us is that the European project is maintained in its coherence.\n\"We have, in these 34 months, managed to progress the matter at hand. We have, in these 34 months, managed to make decisions and above all managed to stay united, together.\n\u201cI think this union is important but the unity of the European project is still at risk.\u201d\nLISTEN HERE: Latest Brexit news from the Express.co.uk Final Countdown podcast",
