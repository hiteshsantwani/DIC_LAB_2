    "text": "All alternative Brexit options were rejected in the Commons by MPs on Monday night as MPs voted to try to find an alternative solution to the Brexit stalemate. BBC\u2019s Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg has claimed the Remainer sects within the Commons have failed in trying to \u201csit down and make peace\u201d as they found to find a majority on any alternative. Kuenssberg also claimed a Remainer cabinet minister was \u201chopping mad\u201d with the Scottish National Party as they abstained from voting on the customs union amendment.\nThe BBC\\'s Political Editor said: \u201cThe Government minister I bumped into was absolutely hopping mad that the SNP didn\u2019t come over to the customs union. \u201cHe said \u2018I can\u2019t believe it, this is our way out\u2019. This is someone who is a soft Brexiteer, who is a strong Remainer but wants a Brexit compromise. \u201cThose Remain forces, former Remainer forces, have all been working ahead together behind the scenes and he was furious. \u201cLots of different factions. Lots of different tribes who haven\u2019t been willing to sit down and make peace.\u201d\nBBC News: Laura Kuenssberg revealed cracks in Remain supporters bid for a soft Brexit\nLots of different tribes who haven\u2019t been willing to sit down and make peace BBC\u2019S Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg\nShe added: \u201cInterestingly even the People\u2019s Vote guys, even the Independent Group, quite of lot of acid commentary tonight that the new Independent Group that wanted a new type of politics are proving to be just as unwilling to comprise as some of those from the more traditional parts.\u201d BBC\u2019s Europe Editor Katya Adler claimed all Remainer groups within the Commons were trying to be the \u201clast one standing\u201d in a bid to get their preferred option over the line. She added: \u201cIsn\u2019t it just that everybody still just thinks if they are the last ones standing they will win out in the end. \u201cSo they are just unwilling to compromise because they just think, \u2018well everybody else will just compromise and we will just stick to our guns and we will get what we want\u2019. \u201cFrom here it feels like the EU, they cannot believe it again tonight to be honest.\u201d\nThe Prime Minister and her senior ministers will meet on Tuesday morning after MPs failed to find a majority for any Brexit alternative. A call for a customs union with the EU was rejected by just three votes, while a demand for a second referendum was defeated by 12 and a Norway-style deal put forward by Nick Boles by 21. Following the defeat of his amendment, Mr Boles immediately declared that he would no longer sit as a Conservative MP, blaming the party for refusing to compromise on a means of leaving the European Union. A statement from Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay read: \u201cThis is the second time the House has considered a wide variety of options for a way forward, it has once again failed to find clear majority for any of the options. \u201cAnd yet the result of the House\\'s decision on Friday not to endorse the Withdrawal Agreement means that the default legal position is that the UK will leave the EU in just 11 days\\' time. \u201cTo secure any further extension, the Government will have to put forward a credible proposition to the EU as to what we will do with that extra time. This House has continuously rejected leaving without a deal, just as it has rejected not leaving at all. Therefore the only option is to find a way through which allows the UK to leave with a deal.",
