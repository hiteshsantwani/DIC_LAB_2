    "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron is \u201cworried\u201d about Britain remaining in the EU, or Brexit having a lengthy delay, Janet Daley, from the Sunday Telegraph has claimed. Speaking on BBC\u2019s Dateline London, Daley claimed Emmanuel Macron\\'s \u201cutopian dream\u201d about Europe was \u201cdiametrically opposed\u201d to the Tories and to \u201cBritain\u2019s history and its institutions\u201d. Ms Daley commented on the prospect of a lengthy delay to Britain\u2019s departure from the EU.\nShe said: \u201cIt\u2019s a question of what Europe would think. \u201cIt is already beginning to become apparent that Macron is seriously worried about either a long extension or us staying in permanently. \u201cHis utopian dream about Europe is diametrically opposed not only to the Tories but to the most fundamental democratic sense of Britain\u2019s history and its institutions. That is a reconcilable difference.\u201d She added: \u201cThey have created a logically impossible situation where it seems to be an unresolvable dilemma of coming out.\nMacron is \\'worried\\' about a Brexit delay or the UK remaining a political commentator claimed\nMacron is seriously worried about either a long extension or us staying in permanently Janet Daley\n\u201cBut, also staying in is irreconcilable from the EU\u2019s point of view.\u201d Ms Daley claimed if the UK remained in the European Union past the European elections, \u201cwe could legitimise an awful lot of the anti-EU eurosceptic sentiment that is so prevalent in Europe because we have this long tradition of stable democracy.\u201d She said: \u201cThat might not be very helpful to people like Macron who want to continue his centralising project and want to continue the federalisation of the EU.\u201d On Friday, Mrs May wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to the Article 50 process until June 30.\nThe Prime Minister said she will seek to ratify her withdrawal agreement before the European Parliament elections on May 23, but will make \"responsible preparations\" to take part if that does not prove possible. Mrs May said if ongoing talks with Labour do not lead to a \"single unified approach soon\" then the Government would instead look to establish a \"consensus\" on options on a future relationship that could be put to the Commons. Reports suggest Mr Tusk is recommending a longer postponement of one year, with a break clause in the case of earlier ratification, in a so-called \"flextension\" deal.",
