    "text": "Theresa May convinced the European Union to agree to a new extension postponing Brexit to the end of October. With the prospect of Britain being forced to field candidates for the European parliamentary elections scheduled for May, Brexiteer Mark Francois issued a dire warning to Brussels of an incoming onslaught of eurosceptic British politicians winning seats in the European Parliament. Speaking to France 24, the pro-Brexit Tory said: \"If there are going to be European elections because we have not left the European Union, then our MEPs will have exactly the same power in Parliament as the MEPs from any other country.\n\"The public in this country want to leave. If you try and hold us in against out will, we will make life difficult for you. \"If there are European elections on May 23, given the growing frustration in Britain, we will probably send you the most eurosceptic group of MEPs you have ever seen.\" The Prime Minister last week requested a delay of the Brexit deadline to June 30 in a last-ditch attempt to draft a satisfactory withdrawal deal with the help of Jeremy Corbyn. But as EU Council boss Donald Tusk and other EU leaders counteroffered - and appeared to agree to - a longer extension, Mr Francois predicted difficult times ahead for supporters of the European project.

Investors expect heightened political uncertainty after the May 26 election, in which 705 members of the European Parliament MEPs will be elected, or 751 if Britain fails to leave the EU as planned. Before the summit, Mr Tusk warned \"neither side should be allowed to feel humiliated at any stage in this difficult process\".",
