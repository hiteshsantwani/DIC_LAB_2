    "text": "Russia and China are the only nations it benefit from Brexit, it has been claimed\nWopke Hoekstra said the only nations to benefit from the UK\u2019s gruelling departure from the EU will be Europe\u2019s biggest rivals Beijing and Moscow, Bloomberg reports. Mr Hoekstra said in an interview in Bucharest: \u201cThe only countries that benefit are Russia and China and for us it\u2019s truly tragic that the largest military power is leaving the EU. \u201cBut it truly is a tragedy and is bad news for everyone involved.\u201d The news comes after Prime Minister Theresa May sparked outrage asking for yet another Article 50 extension from the EU, this time until June 30.\nThis followed talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, another act she was widely condemned for by Brexiteers and even Remainers in her Tory Party. The talks came amid her controversial withdrawal agreement being rejected in three shocking meaningful votes in the House of Commons. Despite the UK struggling to leave the EU, the bloc said at the meeting in Romania it was ready for Brexit.\nEU Commissioner for Economic Affairs Pierre Moscovici said: \u201cWe are prepared also for a no-deal in the field of customs.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are ready to re-establish, if needed, controls.\u201d Today, hardline Brexiteers came together in an attempt to block EU legislation should there be a delay to Article 50.\nBrexiteers came together in an attempt to block EU legislation should there be a delay to Article 50\nJacob Rees-Mogg, chair of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, said that \u201cif a long extension leaves us stuck in the EU we should be as difficult as possible\u201d. He suggested: \u201cWe could veto any increase in the budget, obstruct the putative EU army and block Mr Macron\u2019s integrationist schemes.\u201d But a spokesperson for the European Commission suggested that the Brexiteer was irrelevant.",
