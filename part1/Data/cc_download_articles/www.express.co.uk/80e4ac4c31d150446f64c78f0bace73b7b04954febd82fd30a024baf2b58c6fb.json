    "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron is \u201ctempted\u201d to let Brexit Britain leave the European Union with no deal to deliver a \u201clesson to the eurosceptic nationalists\u201d standing in the European polls at the end of May, BBC\u2019s Europe Editor Katya Adler has claimed. Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Mrs Adler was asked about the prospect of a longer Brexit delay, after the Prime Minister said she would seek a date past April 12 to allow her to speak with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to try to get Britain\\'s exit over the line. She said: \u201cThey have to come to a unanimous decision to a longer Brexit delay. Mr Macron for one, and he is not alone, questions the Prime Minister\u2019s ability to follow through on her promise yesterday to look for compromise and national unity.\n\u201cMr Macron is tempted to go for a sharp shock of no deal on April 12 as a lesson to the eurosceptic nationalists standing for election in the European parliamentary polls next month. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, he does see himself as Mr Europe.\u201d Adler added: \u201cThat said, it is so nuanced here. The bottom line is EU leaders with Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel in the forefront don\u2019t want to have any blame in a no deal Brexit scenario if they can avoid it. \u201cIf Theresa May asks leaders for an extension and agrees to EU conditions attached they can\u2019t really say no or there could be a backlash in those European parliamentary elections anyway by European citizens and businesses affected by no deal, which could play into eurosceptic politicians like Marine Le Pen or Matteo Salvini.\nBBC News: Katya Adler claims Macron is tempted to go for no deal\nMr Macron is tempted to go for a sharp shock of no deal on April 12 BBC\u2019s Europe Editor Katya Adler\n\u201cThe likely answer for an extension is yes, but there will be EU conditions attached.\u201d Mrs May said she would seek a longer extension past next week to allow talks with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to ensure Britain leaves the EU. But, the move has angered Brexit supporters, with some members of the Conservative Party\u2019s eurosceptic European Research Group claiming it is time for Mrs May to step down. After a mammoth Cabinet meeting discussing the future of Brexit, the Prime Minister reached out to the Labour Party leader to help deliver Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc. Mrs May said: \u201cThe ideal outcome of this process would be to agree an approach on a future relationship that delivers on the result of the referendum, that both the leader of the Opposition and I could put to the House for approval and which I could then take to next week\\'s European Council.\n\"However, if we cannot agree on the single unified approach, then we would instead agree a number of options for the future relationship that we could put to the House in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue. \"Crucially, the Government stands ready to abide by the decision of the House. But to make this process work, the opposition would need to agree to this too.\" In response, Mr Corbyn said he would not set any \"limits\" ahead of the meeting with the Prime Minister, but that his principles ahead of it were to recognise the \"needs of the people that elected all MPs to Parliament and the need to avoid the dangers of crashing out\". European Research Group (ERG) chairman Mr Rees-Mogg criticised the Prime Minister for planning to collaborate with \"a known Marxist\" in the Labour leader. He said: \u201cI think getting the support of a known Marxist is not likely to instil confidence in Conservatives. This approach to Government is an unsuccessful one and it also lacks democratic legitimacy.",
