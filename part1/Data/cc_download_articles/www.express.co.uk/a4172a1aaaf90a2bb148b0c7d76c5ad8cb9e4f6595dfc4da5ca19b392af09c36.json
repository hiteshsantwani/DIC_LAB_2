    "text": "Julian Smith, the Conservative Party chief whip launched a furious attack on the cabinet over the way they have managed the Brexit process. Mr Smith claimed the discipline within the divided cabinet was \u201cnot as good as it should be\u201d adding he was growing \u201cfrustrated\u201d. The Conservative Party chief whip also claimed the Government should have been clearer about the consequences of the 2017 general election result and that it would \u201cinevitably\u201d lead to \u201ca kind of softer type of Brexit\u201d.\nHe told the BBC: \u201cThe thing that people forget is that the Conservative Party went to get a majority in order to deliver Brexit, failed to get a majority. \u201cThe Government as a whole probably should have just been clear on the consequences of that. \u201cThe Parliamentary arithmetic would mean that this would be inevitably a kind of softer type of Brexit.\u201d He added: \u201cThe EU are playing pretty hardball. I\u2019m knackered dealing with colleagues 24/7.\nBrexit news: Julian Smith launched a stinging attack on the cabinet\nThe worst example of ill-discipline in cabinet in British political history Julian Smith\n\u201cFrustrated with the fact that people don\u2019t see the light as clearly as I do. \u201cAs you\u2019re aware, discipline is not as good as it should be. This is, I think, the worst example of ill-discipline in cabinet in British political history.\u201d The revealing interview with Laura Kuenssberg will air on Monday evening as MPs prepare to hold further indicative votes to find a solution to the Brexit stalemate. Responding to the interview, former Conservative Party MP and now the interim leader of Change UK - The Independent Group, Heidi Allen, tweeted: \u201cHe\u2019s not wrong! A few us have been saying it and saying it\u2026\u2026\u201d\nPolitical correspondent for ITV News, Paul Brand, tweeted: \u201cUnderstand Chief Whip agreed to BBC documentary assuming it would be retrospective. Hence he is so candid. But in the end delayed events mean it\u2019s being aired before any Brexit deal has passed / resolution has been found.\u201d He later added: \u201cAlthough am also told final interview with him was on Friday, so maybe he\u2019s quite happy to let rip!\u201d The Prime Minister\u2019s Brexit withdrawal agreement was defeated on Friday afternoon by MPs in the House of Commons by 344 votes to 286. Speaking after the defeat, Mrs May said: \u201cThis House has rejected no deal. It has rejected no Brexit. On Wednesday it rejected all the variations of the deal on the table. \u201cAnd today it has rejected approving the withdrawal agreement alone and continuing a process on the future. \u201cThis Government will continue to press the case for the orderly Brexit that the result of the referendum demands.\"",
