    "text": "The European Parliament\u2019s agriculture committee voted to approve a ban on vegetarian and vegan food products carrying the same names as their meat-based alternatives. Steaks, sausages, escalope and burgers are all set for protected status after the committee voted 80 percent in favour of the changes. The decision will see meat-related terms and names \u201cexclusively for edible parts of the animals\u201d.\nThe proposal still needs to be approved by the full European Parliament after May\u2019s Euro election, as well as the European Commission and remaining 27 member states. Eric Andrieu, the French socialist MEP tasked with overseeing the legislation, said the bizarre changes are just \u201ccommon sense\u201d. He said: \u201cIt has generated a considerable debate among the political groups and a large majority wanted to clarify things. \u201cParticularly in the light of history, the history we share, you can have a steak or burger, you can\u2019t call it something else.\u201d\nEU Parliament agriculture committee vote to rename veggie burgers\nHe added: \u201cWe felt that steak should be kept for real steak with meat and come up with a new moniker for all these products. There is a lot to be done in this front, a lot of creativity will be needed. \u201cPeople need to know what they are eating. So people who want to eat less meat know what they are eating \u2013 people know what is on their plate.\u201d The legislation will likely take years to implement, and that is if it is even considered worthwhile by the EU\u2019s institutions. Mr Andrieu has urged Brussels to \u201cget on with it\u201d.\nLiberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder suggested that the plan was just another \u201cweird\u201d proposal to emerge from the EU Parliament\u2019s agriculture committee. She said: \u201cThis is just an Agricultural committee decision. They come out with a fair amount of bizarre proposals. \u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely this decision will pass the full Parliament.\u201d Britain will be forced to follow EU guidelines on food labelling and safety even after Brexit.",
