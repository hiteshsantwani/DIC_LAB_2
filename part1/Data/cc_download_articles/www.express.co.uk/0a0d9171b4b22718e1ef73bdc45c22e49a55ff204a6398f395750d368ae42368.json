    "text": "Diane Abbott refused to say whether Brits having the final say on any Brexit deal had to be the outcome of EU talks with the Government as she was pressed by a BBC host. The Labour Party has been engaged in negotiations with the Government this week after Theresa May reached out to Jeremy Corbyn to try to get Brexit over the line, which sparked fury among many in the Conservative Party. Speaking on BBC\u2019s Today programme, the shadow home secretary was quizzed over whether a second Brexit vote was a \u201cnecessity\u201d of the negotiations with the Government, before she admitted Leave would likely win again.\nMs Abbott said: \u201cThe Labour Party is united on the fact a People\u2019s Vote is still on the table, that is the conference position.\u201d Pressed by Webb on whether any agreement with the Government must have a second vote attached to it, Ms Abbott said: \"We are not saying anything definitively but we have a position.\" The BBC host snapped back: \u201cHold on a second, if you had a position you would be saying it definitively wouldn\u2019t you? \u201cLots of your support, I imagine quite a lot of people listening now, would be saying, \u2018we need another vote and we need Labour, which is overwhelmingly supported actually by people who would like another opportunity to say they want to remain in the EU, we need to have an opportunity to say that\u2019.\u201d\nBrexit news: Diane Abbott clashed with BBC\\'s Justin Webb\nMs Abbott replied: \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote was part of the policy package we passed at conference. Of course, you can have different types of People\u2019s Vote, you can have what is called a confirmatory ballot, where you get a deal and you put it back to the people. That\u2019s a standard trade union process, you negotiate a deal, then you bring it back to your members for a vote. \u201cOr you could have a People\u2019s Vote if you thought it was the only way to stop a no deal Brexit, but the principle of the Labour Party supports some kind of People\u2019s Vote was set out in the policy agreed at conference.\u201d The BBC host demanded to know if the British people having another vote after negotiations was a \u201cred line\u201d. Ms Abbott said Labour was a \u201cmember led party and the members are being clear on this question of some kind of People\u2019s Vote, so it has to be part of our negotiations with the Government.\u201d The BBC host asked whether it \u201chad to be part of the outcome\u201d, to which the Labour frontbencher replied: \u201cIt has to be part of our negotiations.\u201d\nWe are not saying anything definitively but we have a position Diane Abbott\nWebb said: \u201cHold on a minute Diane, that\u2019s crazy, isn\u2019t it? I understand you go in with various things, but what I am trying to get from you, because it is so important to so many of your supporters, is another referendum an absolute necessity of doing a deal with the Government or is it something that you might say \u2018no it\u2019s okay it\u2019s a good enough deal, we will just go with it\u2019.\u201d Ms Abbott replied: \u201cI have said to you we have not gone into these negotiations being dogmatic we have gone into these talks with a preexisting position, and there are different types of People\u2019s Vote that you can have. \u201cThere is no question of the Labour Party leadership dismissing the views of the party as expressed at party conference.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary said she thought a People\u2019s Vote \u201chas its difficulties\u201d claiming that \u201cif we had that vote tomorrow I believe Leave would win.\u201d During the interview, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: \"We engaged in these talks in good faith. Keir Starmer has written to the Government to say he wants to continue the talks, so in that sense, they are going on. There is concern that the Government doesn\\'t want to alter the political declaration.\u201d She added: \"There\\'s no question that the mess we are in is Theresa May\\'s mess, even Tory MPs accept that. The Labour Party has stepped up, we want to help. \u201cWe are engaged in these talks in good faith but the Government perhaps has to show a little more flexibility than it seems to have done so far.\"",
