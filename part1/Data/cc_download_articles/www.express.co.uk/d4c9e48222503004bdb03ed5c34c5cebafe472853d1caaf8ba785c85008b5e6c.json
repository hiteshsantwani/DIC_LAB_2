BBC Weather forecaster, Ben Rich, warned some parts of the Alps would see \u201csignificant\u201d snowfall, with the Swiss Alps potentially seeing up to two metres of fresh snow. Rich said: \u201cWe may be well into Spring now, but, there is a decidedly wintry feel across the western side of Europe over the next few days.\n\u201cYou can see various stripes of cloud pushing in from the northwest. Frontal systems bringing in outbreaks of rain. Behind that this speckled cloud, indicates some wintry showers.\u201d He added: \u201cThose showers are going to become quite widespread across the western side of Europe during Wednesday across the British Isles, into France, northern Spain, and notice this weather system here bringing significant snow up over the Alpes. \u201cStill got a scattering of thunderstorms across the south and the southeast of Turkey, one or two of those in Cyprus as well. \u201cTurns increasingly cloudy across the Balkans and we will see some really strong winds blowing up across the Adriatic as well.\nBBC Weather: Snow forecast to crash into the continent this week\nOver the Swiss Alps over the next couple of days we could see one to possibly two metres of fresh snow BBC Weather forecaster, Ben Rich\n\u201cSouthern Spain and Portugal fine with one sunshine, northern Spain, intro France seeing those wintry showers, a mixture of rain, sleet, and hail. Some snow over the Pyrenees and over the Alps. \u201cIn fact, over the Swiss Alps over the next couple of days, we could see one to possibly two metres of fresh snow. \u201cOutbreaks of heavy rain into Italy, still those strong winds into the Adriatic. Generally into the western side of Europe, a rather cool feel to the weather on Thursday.\u201d Moving towards the weekend, the BBC Weather forecaster added: \u201cIn Madrid on Friday, 9C, that is your top temperature, there will be some showers, showers not too far away from Rome as we move into the next five days, in London, it does turn a little less chilly.\nSnow map shows where in Europe is likely to see snow this week\n\u201cCooling off a bit in Berlin, Moscow mainly dry for the next five days.\u201d It comes as the UK is bracing for snow to fall with bone-chilling Arctic air returning to Britain this week. BBC Weather forecaster Matt Taylor warned, \u201ccolder air\u201d was on its way threatening to bring snow, rain and thunderstorms. He said: \u201cColder air is on its way this week. April showers in the mix as well. A mixture of hail, rain, sleet, even some snow at times and that could give a coating to the hills of northern England, potentially.\u201d Moving into Wednesday, the BBC Weather forecaster said: \u201cThe weather front remains across eastern counties of England, into the end of the day, it is all linked to this area of low pressure which will remain by into Wednesday.
