    "text": "BBC Weather forecaster Darren Bett warned there could be \u201cdangerous travelling conditions\u201d in Finland as snow continues to fall. The BBC\u2019s Ben Rich said an area of high pressure will take charge for most of northern Europe on Tuesday, which will offer fine and settled weather for much of Scandinavia, the British Isles and into northern Germany. But the BBC Weather forecaster warned that as soon as the weather front moves out cooler air will push in and cause temperatures to plummet.\nLow pressure spinning across the north east of Europe, feeding some snow one again across Finland BBC Weather\nMr Rich said: \u201cWe do have one area of low pressure spinning across the northeast of Europe, feeding some snow one again across Finland. \u201cOn the eastern flank of that low, some pretty warm air wafting its way northwards into the likes of Moscow. \u201cNow, further south, things generally very unsettled. Lots of showers and thunderstorms flinging themselves through the Mediterranean, across the Balkans, parts of Greece and Turkey. \u201cLots of heavy downpours across Italy on Wednesday. Perhaps not as many showers at this stage across southern Spain and the southern half of Portugal.\nBBC Weather: Snow set to strike in Finland\n\u201cA scattering of downpours across France and into the south of Germany. Northern Germany largely dry.\u201d Temperatures will drop to the single digits in Berlin on Wednesday as a thick band of cloud covers the city. The BBC forecaster added: \u201cThat sort of weather continues on into Thursday. The snow perhaps starting to ease across Finland by this stage. Lots of showers still across central and eastern parts of the Mediterranean. \u201cIn Madrid, these temperatures recovering over the next few days and getting up to around 20C on Saturday.",
