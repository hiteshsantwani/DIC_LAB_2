More than 400 people came together on the south coast of England to ask for the help of the European Union with mirrors to flash their distress call across the Channel. Artist Duncan McKellar set up the anti-Brexit stunt with the help of several volunteers who pitched up their mirrors around midday on Monday.\nMr McKellar acted with the permission of the local coastguard branch.

Diplomats have said the Prime Minister\u2019s deal is non-negotiable, and with the UK\u2019s exit currently scheduled for April 12, they have warned rival plans would not excuse Britain from taking part in elections to the European Parliament, scheduled for May 23-26.\nBrexit news: MPs will have a chance to vote on eight options to end the deadlock",
