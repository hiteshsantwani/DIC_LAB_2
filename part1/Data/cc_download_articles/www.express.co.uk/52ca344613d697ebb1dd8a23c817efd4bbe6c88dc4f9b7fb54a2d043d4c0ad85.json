    "text": "The EU official will \u201ctake stock of the developments in London\u201d during several meetings in Dublin. He will also meet with Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, and finance minister Paschal Donohue. Britain could leave the EU without a deal as early as Friday if leaders fail to agree another Brexit extension when they meet on Wednesday.\nThe meetings will focus on preparations for emergency European Council summit and no deal plans for the Irish border, according to a European Commission spokesman. They said: \u201cThis is part of his frequent visits to the 27 capitals, ahead of the European Council, of course. \u201cThis visit reflect the ongoing and intensive discussions on the planning of no-deal scenarios, and he\u2019s accompanied by Commission officials to cover all of the Article 50 state of play.\u201d Ahead of Mr Barnier\u2019s Dublin trip, Mr Coveney said the visit represents the Commission and EU\u2019s ongoing show of \u201csolidarity\u201d with Ireland.\nMichel Barnier to hold no-deal Brexit talks with Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar today\nMr Coveney said: \u201cWhat he will want to do first of all is show solidarity with Ireland. \u201cBut also I think he\u2019ll want a detailed conversation in terms of Ireland\u2019s perspective on the most recent ask from the prime minister for an extension of time. \u201cIreland is, of course, willing to give the process more time, but we, like many other EU member states, will want to see a plan to go with that to show that there is a proposed way of finding a majority of support in Westminster for a way forward.\u201d Mr Varadkar and Mr Barnier are expected to host a joint press event after their meeting this afternoon.\nTheresa May last week requested to delay Brexit until June 30 in order to give her more time to win the support of MPs for her deal. Mr Coveney said he could support a short or long extension, he said: \u2018We\u2019re open to either in truth. \u201cAs long as there is a credible plan to get a deal across the line, then I think European leaders will look at an extension positively. \u201cBut they will need to see a credible plan to go with the ask.\u201d Mrs May will also hold her own pre-summit meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday.\nOver the weekend, Mr Varadkar attempted to address the possibility of France vetoing another extension of the EU\u2019s Article 50 exit clause. The Irish leader said he does not believe another member state would veto the delay as \u201cthey would never be forgiven\u201d. Luxembourg\u2019s foreign minister Jean Asselborn suggested the Prime Minister was to blame for the impending no-deal Brexit. He told reporters: \u201cThe British hard turned a deal into a no deal. And now they want to turn the no deal into a deal.",
