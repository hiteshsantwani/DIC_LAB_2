    "text": "Phil Hogan, the European Commission\u2019s agriculture chief, claimed a no deal Brexit would have consequences on both sides of the Channel. The Irish eurocrat described the prospect of a hard divorce as \u201csimply crazy\u201d as he set out implications for no deal. He warned that there would be \u201csignificant disruption\u201d to the agri-food market if Britain quits the EU without a deal, causing significant financial upset across the bloc.\n\u201cDespite the madness of Brexit, I still believe common sense will prevail,\u201d he said. \u201cNo deal makes no sense, it\u2019s simply crazy. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a good outcome in relation to Brexit, but I believe that a no-deal Brexit is the worst of all outcomes.\u201d The largest hit will likely come to EU farmers, who currently sell more to Britain than any other country in the world. Mr Hogan said: \u201cThe EU27 and United Kingdom are very significant trading partners. The EU27 enjoys a \u20ac25 billion surplus with the UK for agri-food products, with exports of \u20ac41bn on an annual basis.\nEU official Phil Hogan warns of \u00a320 billion hit to European farmers in no-deal Brexit\n\u201cThis surplus is higher than the overall EU trade surplus of \u20ac21bn with the rest of the world.\u201d Britain could leave the EU without a deal as soon as Friday unless Theresa May can agree another Brexit delay with EU leaders this week. The European Commission has vowed to offer farmers on the Continent financial support in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Brussels-based executive has tried to shift the emphasis of hard Brexit damage onto Britain, suggesting the country\u2019s farmers would be hit the hardest.\n\u201cOne should not underestimate the importance of the EU market for the UK. given that the EU will treat the UK as any other third country, with application of tariffs and SPS checks, this presents a significant challenge for UK producers and exporters,\u201d Mr Hogan added. Commission officials have suggested that a no-deal Brexit would likely trigger a food shortage in Britain. Sources claim that there is no \u201calternative ready source\u201d for Britain to import agri-food products outside of the EU. They said: \u201cThe UK is hugely reliant on imports from the EU and for particular products, for example fruit and vegetables.",
