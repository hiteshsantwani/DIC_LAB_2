    "text": "The Independent Group MP got into a fiery debate as he called for Britain to have a so-called \u2018People\u2019s Vote\u2019 on the final Brexit deal. The heated exchange began when the Sky News host said: \u201cInterestingly, you spoke about an extreme Brexit. Well, a while ago I was talking to Sir Bernard Jenkin and he said to me that 90 percent of people who voted Leave in the 2016 referendum would prefer the UK to leave on no deal.\n\u201cSo, he is set in his position and that\u2019s not going to move. You are stuck in your position where you are calling for a People\u2019s Vote. So, we remain at this impasse \u2013 we are not moving forwards on this.\u201d\nIn response, Mr Umunna said Bernard Jenkin was one of the \u201carchitects of this mess\u201d, adding: \u201cHe was a leading figure who created the Vote Leave campaign.\u201d\nBut the Sky News host quickly fired back and said: \u201cHe could accuse you of being an architect for this mess because of the fact that you were calling for a People\u2019s Vote and we have already had a referendum.\u201d\nMr Umunna replied and claimed Britain does not have a People\u2019s Vote so it is not \u201ccausing the chaos we find ourselves in now\u201d.",
