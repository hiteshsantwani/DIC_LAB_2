    "text": "John Elliott, the founder of the manufacturer of washing machines and dehumidifiers in the UK, has called for Britain to leave the European Union with no deal and \u201cplay hard\u201d in order to get a pragmatic response from the Brussels bloc. Speaking to BBC 5 Live\u2019s Emma Barnett, Mr Elliott said: \u201cI think the problem with the EU is it is not a very good organisation \u2013 they add nothing but cost and bureaucracy. So, that\u2019s why, I think, the European Union will eventually fail.\u201d\nAs long as they think that they will play hard, as soon as we are out they will become more pragmatic John Elliott\nThe multi-millionaire businessman said there are \u201clots of mistakes\u201d in the claims made surrounding a no deal Brexit, adding: \u201cRemember, the EU want Brexit to fail and we are giving them hope for that as well. \u201cSo, as long as they think that they will play hard, as soon as we are out they will become more pragmatic.\u201d Mr Elliott insisted the EU \u201cadds nothing but cost\u201d and said it is best for Britain to walk away from the Brussels bloc and set its own tariffs. If the UK left the EU without an arrangement in place it would automatically trade under WTO rules.\nBrexit news: Ebac CEO says EU \"adds nothing but cost\" and Britain should leave with no deal\nThe Brexiteer said Britain does not need to stay close to the Union and added: \u201cWe joined the common market where we import more than we export. And we pay for money that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d He ridiculed the negative sentiment from large businesses surrounding Brexit and said: \u201cIt\u2019s the big organisations because they like the EU, don\u2019t they? \"It\u2019s more important what is right for the country than individual businesses. \u201cWe will survive. It\u2019s what is right for the country \u2013 that is more important than what is right for businesses. Businesses serve the people and not the other way around.\u201d",
