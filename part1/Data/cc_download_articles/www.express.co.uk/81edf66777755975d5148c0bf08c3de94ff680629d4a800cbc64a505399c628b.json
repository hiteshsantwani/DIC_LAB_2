    "text": "As Brexit talks reach deadlock and Prime Minister Theresa May battles to find a solution before Friday\u2019s scheduled exit day, the ITV host launched into a furious rant and said the French are \u201claughing\u201d at Britain. Following an interview with former Tory leader Lord Howard about the Brexit impasse, the ITV host said: \u201cI\u2019ve just come back from France over the last few weeks, and I am not making this up when I say I was getting free coffees and croissants in the cafes that I go to a lot there because they feel sorry for me because I am British.\nThey are actually laughing at us. They think we are pathetic Richard Madeley\n\u201cThey are actually laughing at us. They think we are pathetic. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t like us very much but they still think we are pathetic.\u201d Prime Minister Theresa May is travelling to Paris on Tuesday to make a plea for France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron not to veto her request for a further delay to Brexit. President Macron could demand there be no extension of the Article 50 process unless the Prime Minister signs up to binding commitments to stand aside from the EU decision-making process.\nBrexit news: Richard Madeley said French think British are \"pathetic\"\nEU leaders this week must decide whether to grant Britain another Brexit delay, a decision that must get unanimous backing by all 27 member states. The EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has warned the UK will \u201cnot discuss anything\u201d if there is to be a no deal Brexit. Mr Barnier met with Irish premier Leo Varadakar in the Irish capital to \u201ctake stock\u201d of developments in London. Mr Barnier claimed the EU \u201cstood fully behind Ireland\u201d and would \u201crefuse\u201d to talk to the UK under a no deal exit \u201cuntil there is an agreement for Ireland and Northern Ireland\u201d.",
