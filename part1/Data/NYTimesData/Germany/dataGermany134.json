BERLIN â€” Frankfurt prosecutors searched apartments and offices across Germany as part of a broader investigation into a fraudulent share-trading scheme, they said on Thursday.
The practice, known as cum-ex, involves cross-border trading of company shares around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to create the impression of numerous owners, with each entitled to a tax rebate.
There are seven suspects - six men and one woman - aged 46 to 55, the prosecution office said in a statement. The searches were conducted on Tuesday.
The investigation into the scheme began as far back as 2013. Prosecutors have said it misled the German government into paying tax refunds that have cost the country billions of euros.
