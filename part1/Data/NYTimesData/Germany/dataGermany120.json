BERLIN â€” Germany's EU Affairs Minister Michael Roth said on Thursday all options are on the table for Britain after European Union leaders gave London six more months to leave the bloc.
"All options are on the table! Dear British friends, deliver right now," Roth said on Twitter https://bit.ly/2UuG1hX.
He also said a flexible deadline extension - or "flextension" - for Brexit should be as short as possible.
