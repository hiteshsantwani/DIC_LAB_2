COPENHAGEN, Denmark â€” The developers of a natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany applied Monday for a third route south of Denmark's Baltic Sea island of Bornholm, as they try to overcome objections from the country.
The Danish Energy Agency says Nord Stream 2 has applied for an alternative route in the seas south-east of Bornholm in Denmark's exclusive economic zone. It could not say when a permit might be granted but said only one can be granted.
The Switzerland-based Nord Stream 2 confirmed it had been asked to submit an application for another route.
It said in a statement that asking for a third route option "can only be seen as a deliberate attempt to delay the project's completion," adding European consumers could lose as much as "at least 20 million euros" a day.
