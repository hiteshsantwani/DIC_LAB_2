LOHHEIDE, Germany — On a former Cold War base, German and Dutch soldiers, serving together in one tank battalion, stood to attention one recent morning and shouted their battle cry in both languages.
“We fight —,” their commander bellowed.
“— for Germany!” the battalion replied in unison.
“We fight —,” the commander shouted.
“— for the Netherlands!” his soldiers yelled back.
They are not shouting “for Europe.” Not yet.
But the battalion — Europe’s first made up of soldiers from two countries — is an important baby step toward deeper European military cooperation. First floated after World War II, the idea of a European army is as old as the European Union itself, but has yet to become a reality.
Now, though, the idea has taken on new urgency because of the Trump administration’s threat to withdraw the Continent’s security guarantee if it does not spend more on its defense. At a high-level security conference last weekend, the breach between the United States and Europe burst into the open, leaving many European officials feeling increasingly on their own.
