ESLOHE, Germany — German conservative leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said divisions in the ruling coalition about planned military spending were undermining Germany's credibility worldwide.
Speaking at a political rally in the northern state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Kramp-Karrenbauer said she was growing convinced that her conservatives could not rely on their Social Democratic (SPD) coalition partners on the issue of military spending.
While voicing its commitment to multilateralism, Germany is facing increasing criticism from disenchanted allies for making go-it-alone decisions on defense spending, energy and arms exports.
"The big problem we have is that the world has doubts whether it ... can rely on us, and it’s up to us as the CDU to lead, because I have the increasing impression that on this question, we cannot rely on our coalition partner," Kramp-Karrenbauer said.
