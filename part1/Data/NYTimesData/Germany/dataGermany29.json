“We will be watching this very closely,” he said.
The pipeline is fraught with geopolitical significance. United States officials had gone so far as to threaten sanctions against the companies building it, saying it would make Germany even more dependent on Russian energy. Countries including France and Poland shared American concerns.
“It is important to send the signal that we are ready to make progress; we are ready to cooperate,” Mr. Altmaier said during an appearance with Mr. Brouillette at a conference that included representatives of German industry.
Both men said there was no formal deal, but they exuded relief that at least one point of conflict had been eased.
Analysts say a terminal for liquefied natural gas on Germany’s northern shore, where the port would be built, is probably superfluous. Terminals in Belgium, the Netherlands and Poland can pump gas into Germany’s network and are operating far below capacity. And gas transported in tankers is likely to be much more expensive than gas sent by pipeline from Russia.
“If the Germans want to import L.N.G., the obvious way to do it is by the Belgian terminal or the Dutch terminal — not to build their own terminal,” said Jonathan Stern, distinguished research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. “But this is how politics intruded on the situation.”
The Germans are eager to prevent the Trump administration from following through on threats to impose tariffs on imported Mercedes, Porsche, BMW and Audi vehicles. The Commerce Department is expected to submit a report within days that would establish a legal basis for doing so.
By taking steps to import more gas, the Germans are addressing Mr. Trump’s complaints that Germany sells more goods to the United States than it imports.
