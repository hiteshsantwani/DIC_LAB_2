BERLIN â€” A German teenager has gone on trial for the fatal strangling of another boy who allegedly refused his advances.
German news agency dpa reported that the trial opened on Thursday with the defendant's lawyer reading a statement in which the 15-year-old acknowledged responsibility for the 16-year-old victim's death.
Prosecutors accuse the teen of strangling the older but weaker boy after they agreed to meet in a wooded area last October.
The killing prompted widespread shock in Germany.
The teenager on trial hasn't been named due to his age. He faces a prison sentence of up to 10 years if he is convicted of manslaughter. A verdict is expected in June.
