KIRCHHEIMBOLANDEN, Germany â€” For most people, reaching 100 would be reason enough to put one's feet up and take things easy, but Lisel Heise has other ideas.
The German centenarian, a former sports teacher, has started a new chapter in her life by running for election to the council in her home town of Kirchheimbolanden.
She's focusing her campaign on reopening the town's outdoor swimming pool, which closed in 2011.
Heise has long been vocal in her efforts to resurrect it - she dislikes its replacement on the outskirts of town - but has found that, as an older woman, her opinions have often been ignored.
Now that she's reached three figures, she hopes to turn age to her advantage.
"The microphone was often turned off when I started to speak about the swimming pool, and then of course you stop, there's no point," she told Reuters.
