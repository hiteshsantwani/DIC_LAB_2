BERLIN â€” German investor morale improved for the sixth month in a row due to a resilient global economy and a delay to Britain's departure from the EU, a survey showed on Tuesday, but the growth outlook for Europe's largest economy remains clouded by external risks.
The German government is expected to slash its 2019 growth forecast later this week as exporters struggle with weaker demand from abroad, trade tensions triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's "America First" policies and Brexit uncertainty.
ZEW President Achim Wambach said the slight improvement in economic sentiment was largely based on the hope that the global economy would develop less poorly than previously assumed.
"The postponement of the Brexit deadline may also have contributed to buoy the economic outlook," Wambach said.
