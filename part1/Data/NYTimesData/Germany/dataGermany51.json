KARLSRUHE, Germany â€” Pro-euthanasia doctors and patients petitioned Germany's Constitutional Court on Tuesday to overturn 2015 legislation that outlaws commercial assisted suicide.
Like several other European nations, Germany does allow assisted dying - but not when money is involved.
Six complainants, including medics, suicide assistance organizations and terminally ill people, brought the case against the law that stipulates fines and up to three years' prison for commercial help for people to die.
Hans-Juergen Brennecke, suffering from a rare and aggressive form of cancer, said he was fighting both for himself and others with similar conditions. "Everyone should take the final steps in their lives in the way they want," he told Reuters.
