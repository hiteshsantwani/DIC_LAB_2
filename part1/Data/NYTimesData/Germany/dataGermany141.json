FRANKFURT â€” Germany's markets regulator said on Tuesday it had filed a complaint alleging market manipulation in the shares of Wirecard, a payments company whose shares slumped after a Jan. 30 report in the Financial Times alleged financial wrongdoing.
A spokeswoman for regulator Bafin said the complaint, filed to the Munich Prosecutor's Office, concerned around a dozen people it suspects of market manipulation in a short-selling attack.
"We have filed a complaint to the Munich Prosecutor's Office citing suspected market manipulation in the form of a short-selling attack on Wirecard AG," Bafin said, adding it continued to investigate other potential market manipulation.
Bafin does not have the power to file charges in the case. The Munich prosecutor - which is already investigating FT reporter Dan McCrum - does. A spokeswoman for the Munich prosecutor confirmed receipt of the Bafin complaint but declined further comment.
