BERLIN â€” German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has said financial leaders must use talks in Washington this week to avoid any escalation in trade disputes as political risks pose the biggest threat to a slowing world economy.
U.S. President Donald Trump's threat this week to impose tariffs on $11 billion worth of European Union products, including commercial aircraft, has opened a new front in his global trade war and deepened a long-running transatlantic subsidy dispute surrounding Boeing and Airbus.
"All parties must do their part to avoid an escalation of trade disputes," Scholz told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday, ahead of the April 12-14 International Monetary Fund and World Bank Spring Meetings.
Scholz, also vice chancellor in Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing coalition, said the global economy was losing steam, but there was still growth in Europe and Germany, and that political problems such as the U.S. trade disputes and Brexit could be solved.
