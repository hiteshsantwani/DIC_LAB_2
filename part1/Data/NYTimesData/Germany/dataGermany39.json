“These basic points will not make any legal claims in Germany easier,” he said in an interview.
A major hurdle for legal claims is the question of who can represent groups of peoples, tribes or families who owned the artifacts more than a century ago.
But Klaus Lederer, the Berlin senator responsible for culture, wrote in an email exchange that the agreement was an important first step in a “process of discussion,” which German states need to follow up. “It was important to me that colonial injustice is clearly named as such,” he said.
In agreeing to a common set of principles, the authorities also vowed to distinguish between art looted during the Nazi era — on which the country has made some progress since signing the Washington Principles two decades ago — and artifacts taken during colonial times — which until recently were mostly ignored.
Last year, Berlin’s state museums returned nine artifacts to indigenous groups in Alaska. The artifacts, which came from a burial site, were not taken from a German colony, but the return of the items signaled a shift in how museums were dealing with objects that were collected by European explorers at a time when it was common to take foreign artifacts without regard for their ownership.
The Humboldt Forum, a state-funded museum that is set to open this fall with large archaeological and ethnological collections, is at the center of the debate about restitution in Germany. It has drawn protests from activists who say the museum has not done enough to research the provenance of objects in its collection.
Berner Wolter, a spokesman for the museum, said the new guidelines would “change very little for us.”
“The Humboldt Forum has already followed these principles in its plans in recent years,” he said, adding that the agreement “represents a renewed call to to pursue this topic even more intensively.”
