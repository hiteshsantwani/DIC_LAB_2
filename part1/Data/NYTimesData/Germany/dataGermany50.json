(Reuters) - Recruiter Hays posted quarterly net fee growth below market expectations on Tuesday, as its biggest market Germany was hit by slowing growth and a trade spat between Beijing and Washington.
The staffing company had in February flagged a lower level of contractor extensions in Germany, reducing its overall growth rate, as Europe's largest economy reported its weakest growth rate in five years.
Hays, which is focused on white collar jobs, reported a 6 percent rise in net fees for the third quarter through March, against 10 percent a year earlier and a consensus expectation of 7 percent, according to Liberum analysts.
Shares in the company, which had hit a five-month high of 163.5 pence on Monday, were down 3.9 percent at 156.7p by 0807 GMT, making them the second biggest losers on London's midcap index.
