BERLIN â€” German industrial output rose by 0.7 percent in February as mild weather helped a surge in construction activity but manufacturing production dipped, doing little to boost spirits in Europe's largest economy after a run of negative news.
Germany is suffering from trade friction and Brexit angst after narrowly avoiding recession last year. Leading economic institutes slashed their forecasts for 2019 growth on Thursday and warned a long-term upswing had come to an end.
The rise in output exceeded expectations for a 0.5 percent increase on the month. January's reading was revised up to show no change from a previously reported contraction of 0.8 percent, Statistics Office figures showed.
"The industrial sector is expected to remain subdued given the weak development in orders and the gloomier business climate," the Economy Ministry said in a statement.
