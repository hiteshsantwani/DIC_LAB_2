BERLIN â€” German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz will urge financial leaders next week to strive for a minimum level of corporate taxation globally and increase debt transparency in developing countries, a senior German government official said on Friday.
The talks in Washington will be dominated by political risks such as trade disputes and Britain's departure from the European Union, said the government official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Scholz, who is likely to face calls to increase fiscal stimulus to counter the effect of a slowing economy, will tell allies that Germany's large current account surplus will shrink gradually due to vibrant domestic demand, rising real wages and increased state spending, the official added.
"This won't happen rapidly, this will happen step by step," the official said.
Germany expects its current account surplus, by far the largest in the world, to shrink to the equivalent of 6.8 percent of its economic output next year from 7.3 percent this year.
