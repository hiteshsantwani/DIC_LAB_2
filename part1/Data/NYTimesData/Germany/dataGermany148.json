BRUSSELS â€” German electronics firm Bury has asked European Union antitrust regulators to investigate Nokia's licensing practices on patents essential to car communications, the second such complaint after Daimler.
While companies with key patents are expected to offer these on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, the lack of clear rules on calculating license fees and terms inevitably lead to disputes when companies fail to agree on the charges.
Bury, a family-owned company with production plants in Germany, Poland and Mexico, said it had filed a complaint to the European Commission.
"Nokia refuses to license mobile components. Instead, Nokia insists on indirect licensing of the entire vehicle," Bury said in a statement.
