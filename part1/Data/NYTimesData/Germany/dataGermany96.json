SPREMBERG, Germany â€” A German far-right party is using a simple message to attract voters in a mining region threatened by government plans to phase out coal: jobs are more important than the environment.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's aim to wean Europe's biggest economy off fossil fuels is the main issue in a September election in the state of Brandenburg, where the Alternative for Germany (AfD) is almost neck-and-neck with her conservatives.
"People are counting on us to stop this nonsense," Steffen Kubitzki, an AfD candidate seeking a seat in the Brandenburg assembly, told supporters at a campaign event last month in Spremberg, a town of 23,000 near the Polish border.
"We won't get a second chance. We will go from village to village, door to door, and tell people to vote for us," he added, drawing applause from the 50 men and five women gathered at a restaurant in the mining town. "Jobs are on the line."
