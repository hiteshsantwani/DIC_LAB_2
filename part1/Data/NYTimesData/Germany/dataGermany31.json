BERLIN — A potential merger between Germany’s two biggest banks, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, has generated a lot of debate, but Chancellor Angela Merkel sees no role for herself, or her government, in the discussions.
In a speech on Tuesday, Ms. Merkel urged her government “not to interfere” in the exploratory talks that were announced on Sunday. A merger would aim to create a German banking giant capable of competing globally, but the talks have drawn criticism from unions and opposition lawmakers.
The German government holds a 15 percent stake in Commerzbank, which it acquired as part of a bailout in 2009. But the chancellor insisted that is not large enough to justify involvement in the process.
“It is a small stake, therefore, this is an absolutely private decision with all of the challenges, opportunities and risks that only those involved can and must weigh,” said Ms. Merkel, a member of the conservative Christian Democratic Union, speaking at the Global Solutions Summit, a policy forum, in Berlin.
