BERLIN â€” A longer Brexit extension would have been better, a senior German conservative said on Thursday, after European Union leaders gave Britain six more months to leave the bloc.
Norbert Roettgen, a senior member of Chancellor Merkel's conservatives, said French President Emmanuel Macron had put his election campaign and interests before European unity. Macron fought a largely solo campaign to persuade EU leaders not to give the British up to another year.
Roettgen - who is head of the foreign affairs committee in Germany's parliament - wrote on Twitter: "#UK now needs to use new deadline to either decide on the case or a political path forward. Good news: time should be sufficient for that."
