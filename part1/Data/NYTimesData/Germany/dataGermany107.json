BERLIN â€” The European Union should agree to a Brexit extension if it enables Britain to avoid a chaotic exit, a senior German conservative said after British Prime Minister Theresa May asked the EU for a delay of Brexit until up to June 30.
Armin Laschet, the premier of Germany's biggest regional state, North Rhine-Westphalia, said on Twitter: "If Britain asks for an extension to avoid a chaotic exit from the EU with incalculable risks for hundreds of thousands of jobs, we should agree."
He added: "The longer the better. That means the Brits take part in the European elections too."
