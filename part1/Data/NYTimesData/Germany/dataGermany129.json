BERLIN â€” The European Union should help Britain reach an agreement for an orderly Brexit, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday, adding that he hoped a chaotic departure from the bloc could be averted.
"Everyone in Europe hopes that there will be an agreement between the government and opposition about the way to get an agreed Brexit," Scholz said.
"It's the task of the European Union to be helpful in a process in the United Kingdom like this," Scholz said. "I hope that the risk of a no-deal Brexit is decreasing."
German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants European Union leaders meeting later on Wednesday to grant Britain a delay in its divorce from the bloc, but also to make sure once a decision is made in London, Brexit can take place quickly.
