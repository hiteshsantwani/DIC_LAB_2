BRUSSELS â€” The 'De Gaulle moment' that many had speculated about before Wednesday night's Brexit summit did not come, but President Emmanuel Macron still lived up to the spirit of the post-war French leader by throwing his weight around the EU table.
Macron may not have used his veto, but his dogged determination to block a one-year extension to Britain's divorce talks with the EU, favored by a majority of European leaders, irritated many in Brussels - and chiefly Germany.
That could signal a new willingness to challenge Angela Merkel's moral leadership in Europe as the German chancellor nears the end of her reign and France grows impatient with what it sees as her tendency to procrastinate.
Unusually, the EU's two most powerful leaders failed to reach a Franco-German compromise at their bilateral meeting in Brussels before the summit with the other EU leaders started, diplomats said.
