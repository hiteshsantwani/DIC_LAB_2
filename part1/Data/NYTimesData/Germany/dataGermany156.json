FRANKFURT — Deutsche Bank managers used to boast that theirs was one of the few global investment banks to survive the financial crisis without a government bailout.
That was before the scandals, the multibillion-dollar fines and the plummeting stock price. Now, a decade after the global meltdown, it looks like Berlin may intervene after all.
The market chatter is that the government will strong-arm Deutsche Bank into a merger with its Frankfurt crosstown rival Commerzbank, which also has major problems. The two banks are Germany’s largest, and the government’s likely aim is to ensure the country has at least one big-league lender.
Neither the banks nor officials in Berlin are commenting on persistent reports in a wide variety of German publications, including the Handelsblatt newspaper and Manager magazine, but a government manifesto in February effectively endorsed the idea. Germany needs a bank that can “stand up to competitors from the United States and China,” the document said.
