CARACAS â€” German public television broadcaster Deutsche Welle said on Monday that its Spanish-language channel was restored to Venezuela cable television following a government order that took it off the air over the weekend.
Deutsche Welle on Sunday said state telecoms regulator Conatel had halted its broadcasting in the South American nation.
"I would like to thank the many Venezuelan users who have spoken on social networks in favor of the reception of DW," Deutsche Welle Director General Peter Limbourg wrote on Twitter.
A spokeswoman for the German Foreign Ministry on Sunday urged Caracas to allow broadcasting to resume.
