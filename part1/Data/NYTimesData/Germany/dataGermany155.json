Venezuela: President Nicolás Maduro used Cuban doctors, who were in the country on medical missions, to coerce voters. The doctors went door-to-door, warning ill and elderly people that care would be cut off if they did not vote for the governing party.
West Bank: An assailant believed to be Palestinian killed an Israeli soldier in the occupied West Bank. The attack came amid a heated campaign for an April 9 election.
Philippines: The country formally withdrew from the International Criminal Court as it faced a preliminary inquiry into whether President Rodrigo Duterte has engaged in mass murder and crimes against humanity.
