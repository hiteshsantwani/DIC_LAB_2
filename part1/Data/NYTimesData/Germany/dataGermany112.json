BUCHAREST â€” Italy's economic situation is "delicate" and needs to be monitored closely, the European Union economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici said on Friday, as concerns are growing over the threat of recession there and a slowdown in Germany.
Moscovici's worries were echoed by France's finance minister Bruno Le Maire, who openly talked of a recession in Italy arriving at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Bucharest which will also discuss the implications for Italy's huge public debt caused by the emigration of skilled workers.
Moscovici said some estimates showed Italy could be in a recession this year. "These are figures that we need to follow very closely," he said.
Earlier this week the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, a club of mostly rich nations, forecast a 0.2 percent output fall in Italy this year.
