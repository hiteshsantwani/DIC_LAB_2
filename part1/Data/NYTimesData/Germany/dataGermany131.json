BERLIN â€” Germany's state-funded public broadcaster Deutsche Welle said on Sunday that Venezuela's broadcast authority had blocked its Spanish-language channel from cable networks in the country.
Germany, the United States and most other Western countries consider the 2018 election of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro illegitimate and have recognised opposition leader Juan Guaido as the company's interim president. Maduro dismisses Guaido as a U.S. puppet.
DW's general manager Peter Limbourg urged broadcast authority Conatel to "urgently resume distributing the signal of DW."
The Venezuelan Ministry of Information, which controls Conatel, had no immediate comment.
A German foreign ministry spokeswoman urged Caracas to allow the Deutsche Welle (DW) broadcasts to continue.
