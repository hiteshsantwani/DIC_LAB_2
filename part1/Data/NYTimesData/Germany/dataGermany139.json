BRUSSELS â€” Germany, France, Luxembourg and the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier favored a shorter delay to Britain's departure from the bloc in talks on the eve of a summit of EU leaders in Brussels, a document seen by Reuters showed.
EU leaders meeting on Wednesday are set to grant Britain a second delay to Brexit but have not yet decided how long this new extension should be.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May has asked for an extension until June 30. Summit chair Donald Tusk favors a longer, flexible Brexit delay of up to 12 months.
EU ministers on Tuesday were divided on the duration of the extension, the document shows.
Those backing a shorter respite for Britain said it would keep up pressure on the divided British parliament to ratify the withdrawal agreement May reached with the EU in November.
