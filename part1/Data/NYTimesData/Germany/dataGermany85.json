ATHENS, Greece â€” Greece's prime minister said Wednesday his government "promptly" will formally revive a long-standing demand for Germany to pay vast reparations for the World War II Nazi occupation.
Alexis Tsipras said that now Greece has exited its bailout programs, in which Germany was a key creditor, it can't be accused of trying to offset its massive debt with the reparation demand.
He told a special parliamentary session that Athens will make use of European and international law to back its demand, which Germany has repeatedly rejected.
"We will await the German government's response," Tsipras said. "But whatever that response is, this time we must not allow the issue to lie dormant ... this time we will insist."
