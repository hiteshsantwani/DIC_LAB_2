FRANKFURT â€” A boom in property prices is boosting private wealth in Germany but it remains unevenly distributed across the country, a Bundesbank study showed on Monday.
The net wealth of the median German household was 70,800 euros in 2017, a 17 percent increase from the previous survey three years earlier, largely due to a jump in the value of primary residences.
The study illustrates some of the effects of the European Central Bank's ultra-easy monetary policy, which has helped fuel a German property boom by depressing borrowing costs.
This policy has long been criticised in the country for bringing down yields on fixed-income investments popular with local savers.
