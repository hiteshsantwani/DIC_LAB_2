BERLIN — Poland should follow Greece in stepping up pressure on Germany to pay billions of euros in damages for Nazi occupation during World War Two, a lawmaker in charge of Warsaw's reparations campaign said on Thursday.
Greece's parliament voted a day earlier to launch a diplomatic push to press its case - and Berlin responded by reiterating its position that all such claims by invaded countries had long been settled.
Arkadiusz Mularczyk, who heads the Polish parliamentary committee on reparations, said in a tweet that the Greek vote showed WW2 compensation had become an international issue.
"It’s time for a decision from the Polish Sejm (lower house of Parliament)," added the lawmaker from the ruling nationalist Law and Justice party.
