BERLIN â€” The German government is expected to halve its economic growth forecast for 2019 to 0.5 percent from 1.0 percent due to weaker exports in the wake of global trade tensions, the news magazine Der Spiegel reported late on Thursday.
It said the new forecast for Europe's largest economy, which is to be released next Wednesday, could still change marginally.
The government expects gross domestic product to grow by 1.5 percent in 2020, partly because of positive calendar effects from four public holidays falling on weekends, Spiegel reported.
Germany's leading economic institutes last week also revised down their 2019 growth forecast to 0.8 percent from a previous estimate of 1.9 percent.
