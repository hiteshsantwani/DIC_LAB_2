Re “Autobahn Speed Limits? Voting With Lead Feet” (Germany Dispatch, front page, Feb. 4):
Having lived and worked in Germany for about eight years, I feel that this article paints a rather one-sided picture of driving on the autobahns. I have no issue with the benefit of reasonable speed limits and believe that Germans’ resistance to them is irrational. But the article makes it sound as though driving the autobahns is like the Wild West.
Far from it. German drivers are, on the whole, far more regimented and diligent than the American drivers I encounter now that I’m back living in the United States. My two biggest complaints here (and they’re related) are people driving slowly in the passing lanes, and tailgating.
In Germany, drivers strictly adhere to the concept that you drive in the right-hand lane and use the left lane only to pass a car, moving immediately back to the right lane. This frees up the “fast” lane for cars that choose to drive faster. Here, cars drive any speed they choose in any lane, with the result that cars wanting to drive faster either tailgate or continually change lanes and pass on the right — both actions that increase the risks of an accident.
Which is more dangerous — no speed limits with diligent drivers or what we have on our freeways?
