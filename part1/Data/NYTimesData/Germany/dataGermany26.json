WASHINGTON — The rules-based order of multilateralism is increasingly under threat and leaders must uphold international cooperation, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said in Washington on Friday, calling on the United States to overcome trade differences with Europe.
U.S. President Donald Trump's threat this week to impose tariffs on $11 billion (£8.4 billion) worth of European Union products, including commercial aircraft, has opened a new front in his global trade war and deepened a long-running transatlantic subsidy dispute surrounding Boeing and Airbus.
The U.S. government is also mulling higher import tariffs on European cars on grounds that they are posing a threat to the national security of the country. The move would particularly hurt the German economy and its huge car industry.
Speaking at a forum at the Peterson Institute on the sidelines of the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Scholz said both the United States and the EU had been advocates of open and fair trade for decades.
