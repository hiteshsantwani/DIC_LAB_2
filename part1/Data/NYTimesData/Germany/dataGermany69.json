BERLIN â€” Germany's parliamentary watchdog has ordered the far-right opposition party Alternative for Germany (AfD) to pay a fine of more than 400,000 euros for violating party donation rules, the AfD said on Tuesday.
The party said it would appeal the decision by the parliament's administration, which said the AfD had breached rules prohibiting German parties from receiving donations from entities outside the European Union.
German media have reported that two AfD members had funded their campaigns in two German state elections in 2016 and 2017 in part with donations from Goal AG, a public relations company based in Switzerland, which is not an EU member.
A spokesman for the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, was not immediately available for comment. The Swiss company also could not immediately be reached for comment.
