Portuguese officials had previously said they had not yet identified the victims by name or nationality.
People at the roadside are also thought to be among the injured.
Tomasia Alves, head of the Funchal hospital, said authorities hope to have a list of victims by Saturday. She said the victims were roughly between 40 and 60 years old and included no children.
She said 28 people were taken from the accident scene to a morgue, and another person died later in hospital.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he was "deeply shaken by the tragic bus crash." He was due to travel to Madeira on Thursday afternoon and meet his Portuguese counterpart there.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed "sadness and shock" at the accident. "My sincere sympathy goes especially to all of the families who have lost their loved ones in this tragedy," she said.
