BERLIN/WASHINGTON â€” The German government is set to halve its 2019 growth forecast for Europe's biggest economy, a government source told Reuters on Friday, reflecting a worsening slowdown led by a recession in the manufacturing sector.
The source said the government, which will update its forecast next week, now expects the economy to grow by 0.5 percent this year, lower than a recent estimate of 0.8 percent by Germany's leading economic institutes. The government's last forecast in January was for 1 percent growth in 2019.
In Washington on Friday, the president of Germany's central bank Jens Weidmann said German economic growth would slow sharply this year as trade disputes and Brexit uncertainty are weighing on exports and investment activity.
The Bundesbank chief was speaking on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings.
