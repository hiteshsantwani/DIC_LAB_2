BERLIN — After a brief ceasefire, Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats are fighting among themselves again over the future shape and leadership of their party as the chancellor stage-manages her exit as German leader.
The battle, ostensibly over a new industrial strategy led by Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, is symptomatic of a deeper struggle in the party over its future and has broken a truce agreed in December after a divisive leadership contest.
At stake are both the direction the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) takes as it starts to chart a course for the post-Merkel era, and the prospects of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer - the new party leader and Merkel's protege.
The debate pits supporters of a more interventionist industrial policy like Altmaier against CDU traditionalists who seek to limit the state's role to creating the right legal framework for competition to flourish. They see this approach, known as "ordo-liberalism", as key to Germany’s postwar economic revival.
