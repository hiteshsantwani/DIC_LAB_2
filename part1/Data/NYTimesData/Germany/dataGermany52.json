BERLIN â€” Activity in Germany's services sector rose to a seven-month high in April, a survey showed on Thursday, adding to expectations that Europe's biggest economy will get impetus from its domestic market as falling exports hurt its manufacturers.
IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) measuring activity in the services and manufacturing sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy rebounded to 52.1.
The bounce back was mainly driven by services where activity was measured at 55.6, the highest reading since September 2018.
The manufacturing sector shrank for the fourth month in a row, however, although the contraction was slightly smaller than in March.
