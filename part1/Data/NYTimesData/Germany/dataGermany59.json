BERLIN — The German government on Wednesday slashed its 2019 economic growth forecast for the country for the second time this year, halving its outlook to a meager 0.5%.
The update came less than three months after the government cut its forecast to 1% from 1.8% in late January.
Weaker growth elsewhere as a result of global trade tensions and uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union has weighed on Germany's prospects — along with the after-effects of its own weak performance at the end of last year, when output was dragged down largely by one-time factors related to new car emissions standards.
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier predicted growth of 1.5% in 2020, a marginally worse outlook than the 1.6% forecast in January. Last year, gross domestic product expanded by 1.4%.
