A former El Museo board member, Alex Gonzalez, said he had asked the museum how Princess Gloria, who was reported to have once blamed the nature of Africans for spreading AIDS on that continent, “aligns with the mission and purpose of a Latinx institution” — but had not received an answer.
“Her views on the African AIDS crisis were so lacking in humanity and expressed so publicly on live TV that it should have raised a red flag,” he said on Wednesday in an email message.
After inquiries by The New York Times on Wednesday, the museum issued a statement on Thursday morning. “As a cultural institution founded on the principles of inclusion, civil rights and diversity, El Museo del Barrio is committed to honoring individuals that uphold those values and support the elevation of Latino and Latin American art and culture both in the United States and beyond,” the museum said. “As a result, El Museo del Barrio has decided to part ways with H.S.H. Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis.”
Princess Gloria, reached on Thursday by email, said: “I am disappointed to what degree the society is divided today and that there seems to be absolutely no room for tolerance whatsoever. My conservative religious views have absolutely no impact on my open mind on cultural diversity and inclusion. I have been friends with all sorts of people of different political and religious views all my life.”
The criticism is the latest in a series of controversies to buffet El Museo, a respected institution that has put on well-received shows but which has also experienced serious setbacks. Financial shortfalls have forced staff cuts and reduced operating hours. Several high-profile executive departures have created a sometimes acrimonious climate.
