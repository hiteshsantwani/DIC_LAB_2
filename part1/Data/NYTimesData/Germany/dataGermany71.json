They seem like nice people, Victor the doctor and Martha the maid, chatting away companionably in his comfortable office at the clinic.
It’s bitter winter in Winkelheim, Germany, and wartime has made coffee a luxury. But behind his desk Victor sips a precious morning cup, and while Martha tidies the room he asks after her son, whose chest cold is lingering.
“You should take him to a doctor,” Victor says. “Not me, obviously.”
No, not him, and certainly not here, where the young patients — so called — are intended to be killed.
Directed by Ethan McSweeny in a powerfully performed production at the Sheen Center, Stephen Unwin’s historical drama “All Our Children” takes place in 1941, as the Nazis are quietly exterminating thousands of children. The state has deemed them “unworthy of life” because they have Down syndrome or cerebral palsy or any number of other conditions.
