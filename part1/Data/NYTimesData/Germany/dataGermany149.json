BERLIN — German wind turbine manufacturer Senvion, which filed for insolvency last week, has signed an agreement with its lenders and main bond holders for a 100 million euro (£87 million) loan.
Senvion said in a statement the facility meant the group could continue operations and allows for substantial drawings already this week, helping the company to stabilise its affairs and provide funds to non-insolvent subsidiaries.
"This is particularly helpful since we managed to significantly ramp up our installations in the first quarter," said Chief Executive Yves Rannou, who took the helm in January.
Senvion said it installed 366 MW worldwide in the period, more than twice as much as a year ago, with the majority of the new capacity in growth markets in Latin America and Australia.
