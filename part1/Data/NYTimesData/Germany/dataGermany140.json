BERLIN â€” Former German Football Association (DFB) president Reinhard Grindel on Wednesday announced his resignation from the world and European soccer bodies, FIFA and UEFA, after leaving the DFB last week over an expensive gift.
Grindel had had to apologise for accepting an expensive watch from a Ukrainian colleague as a gift, and said he had not known its value.
Now he said he was also leaving his UEFA Vice Presidency and his seat on the FIFA Executive Council.
"I am mainly interested in protecting the good name of UEFA," he said in a statement. I also do not want to burden FIFA on its path to more transparency and good governance."
