BRUSSELS â€” The European Union will grant Britain another delay to Brexit on certain conditions, including that it holds European Parliament elections, according to a draft statement by the bloc's national leaders, who are due to decide on the matter on Wednesday.
The EU would cut Britain off on June 1 if it failed to honor that condition - but so far the draft conclusions have left the end-date of the postponement blank before national diplomats discuss them later in the evening in Brussels.
According to the draft seen by Reuters, the EU will agree "an extension to allow for the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement". It could be cut short if both the EU and Britain ratify the Brexit deal before it runs its course.
The EU will demand that Britain's extended stay in the bloc cannot undermine its key institutions.
"If the UK is still a member of the EU on 23-26 May 2019 and if it has not ratified the Withdrawal Agreement by 22 May 2019, it must hold the elections to the European Parliament in accordance with Union law," the draft said.
