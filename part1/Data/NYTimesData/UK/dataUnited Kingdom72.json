Stately Seclusion off the Coast of France
$2.6 MILLION (1.95 MILLION POUNDS)
This four-bedroom house is in the northern parish of St. John on Jersey, a British dependency that is one of the Channel Islands, 15 miles off the northwestern coast of France. The 5,428-square-foot house sits among a group of buildings on a former 19th-century farmstead and includes an attached duplex workshop, a two-car garage and an 8,700-square-foot yard.
Built in 1875 with a granite ashlar facade and slate roof, the house consists of a three-story main portion and a perpendicular one-story section. It has been renovated in the past decade, incorporating modern features inside while retaining much of its historic character, said Simon Torode, the founder and chief executive of Livingroom, the Jersey-based agency that has the listing.
“Jersey’s historic buildings are a tangible part of the island’s distinctive cultural heritage,” he said.
Several two- and three-story structures on the site have been converted into homes and are not included in the sale. The original developer of the property also lives on the site, in a small walled complex.
