WASHINGTON â€” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on President Donald Trump Tuesday to sign into law a resolution ending American involvement in the war in Yemen.
"The situation in Yemen ... has left an indelible scar and stain on the conscience of the world," Pelosi told reporters. She said the resolution passed by Congress last week sets "a standard for what kinds of military engagements we take part in."
Trump has already pledged to veto the measure.
Under the War Powers Resolution enacted in 1973, the president is required to "consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities."
The White House statement threatening a veto argued U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen does not constitute engaging in "hostilities," meaning the War Powers Act doesn't apply. It also said the bill raises "serious constitutional concerns."
