A Turkish television network broadcast video on Monday showing men with suitcases supposedly containing the remains of Jamal Khashoggi, the dissident writer killed by Saudi agents in October.
After weeks of shifting stories about Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance, Saudi Arabia said that its agents had killed him in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul during a botched mission to take him back to the kingdom.
The Saudi account of the killing has continued to change since then, without providing clues about an enduring mystery of the murder: What happened to Mr. Khashoggi’s remains?
Turkish officials have said that Saudi agents disassembled Mr. Khashoggi’s body with a bone saw, and probably carried the remains out of the consulate in suitcases.
