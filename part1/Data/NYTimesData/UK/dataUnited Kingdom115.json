BRUSSELS â€” An alliance of pro-EU conservative, socialist and liberal parties would win an absolute majority in next month's European Parliament election, though eurosceptic groups will gain ground, a survey showed on Thursday.
With Britain expected to participate after its departure from the European Union was delayed, the proportion of the assembly's seats held by eurosceptics is seen rising to 14.3 percent from around 10 percent currently, according to the compilation of national polls commissioned by the European Parliament.
The figure was 13.0 percent in the previous survey in March, which did not include British voters.
Currently, a coalition of centre-right and centre-left groupings holds a majority.
Under the new survey, which includes national polls published up to April 15 and assumes the number of seats will remain at 751, the centre-right European People's Party (EPP) will remain the largest grouping with 180 seats, which represents 24.0 percent of the total, down from nearly 29 percent currently.
