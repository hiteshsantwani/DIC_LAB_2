DALLAS â€” The Latest on the Boeing's troubled 737 Max jet (all times local):
2:40 p.m.
Boeing has made 96 flights to test a software update for its troubled 737 Max jet, the company's CEO says.
Dennis Muilenburg said Thursday that more test flights are planned in the coming weeks as Boeing attempts to convince regulators that the plane is safe.
The Max was grounded by regulators around the world last month after a second deadly crash involving the plane, in Ethiopia.
In that crash and an October crash in Indonesia, faulty information from a sensor caused anti-stall automation to kick in and push the plane's nose lower. Pilots were unable to save the planes.
