Saudi interrogators have reportedly tortured at least four of the women with electric shocks, and by whipping their thighs and sexually harassing and assaulting them, Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Thursday.
The nations’ statement said, “We call on Saudi Arabia to take meaningful steps to ensure that all members of the public, including human rights defenders and journalists, can freely and fully exercise their rights to freedoms of expression, opinion and association, including online, without fear of reprisals.”
The rebuke also signaled the enduring international outrage over the murder of Mr. Khashoggi six months after Saudi agents killed and dismembered him at the consulate. The Saudi authorities have charged 11 people in the case, but it has denied American intelligence reports that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing.
The 36 nations that backed the rebuke, among them Australia and Canada, urged Saudi Arabia to cooperate with an inquiry into the murder led by a United Nations expert, Agnès Callamard. She is to submit her findings to the Human Rights Council in June.
“The circumstances of Mr. Khashoggi’s death reaffirm the need to protect journalists and to uphold the right to freedom of expression around the world,” the statement said.
Though the 28 members of the European Union spoke with one voice Thursday in the council to condemn Saudi human rights abuses, the bloc’s leaders in Brussels backed away from a proposal to blacklist the kingdom over accusations that it helps fund terrorism and launders money.
European lawmakers said last month they planned to expand a list of states seen as weak when it comes to cracking down on tainted money, proposing to add Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Panama, among others, to a roster that already included countries such as North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Ethiopia and Afghanistan.
