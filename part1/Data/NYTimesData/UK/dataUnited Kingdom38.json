BRUSSELS â€” European Union will have more meetings without Britain and will demand the country refrains from undermining the bloc "in particular when participating in the decision-making processes" during an extension, according to updated draft conclusions.
EU leaders are meeting in Brussels to agree a second delay to Brexit and their summit's draft conclusions were updated on Wednesday evening with more safeguards aimed at preventing Britain from being a disruptive member during an extension.
In particular, the draft, which was seen by Reuters and could still be changed during the talks, said: "The 27 Member States and the (European) Commission ... will continue to meet separately at all levels to discuss matters relations to the situation after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom."
