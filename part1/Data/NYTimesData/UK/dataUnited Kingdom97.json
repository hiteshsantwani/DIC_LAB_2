DINARD, France â€” When Jeremy Hunt sat down on Friday with rights lawyer Amal Clooney to advocate better protection for journalists, Britain's foreign minister was at pains to stress its enduring importance on the world stage.
Why, given the chaos of Brexit, should anyone pay attention at a time when the country was struggling to run itself, reporters asked him.
"Be in no doubt the United Kingdom will continue to play a leading role championing democratic values around the world," Hunt batted back on the sidelines of a G7 summit.
"That's what we've always done and that's what we always will do."
With Britain anxious to assert its influence and broker new trade deals globally as it prepares to leaves the world's biggest trading bloc, Hunt in October set out plans to expand its diplomatic cadres after years of budget cuts.
