SYDNEY â€” Australia said on Friday it would oppose the death penalty for Julian Assange if he's extradited to the United States, as protesters in Sydney called for his release and Australia's journalists' union voiced its strong support for him.
The Australian WikiLeaks founder was arrested Thursday in London's Ecuadorian Embassy and the judge found him guilty of breaching his bail conditions. He faces a U.S. charge of conspiring to reveal government secrets.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said any extradition plans had "nothing to do with Australia," and that Assange would receive only standard assistance from Australian consular officials. Tthe 47-year-old would have to face the consequences of any breach of the law in foreign jurisdictions, Morrison said.
Foreign Minister Marise Payne, however, responded to fears from Assange's supporters over his possible punishment in the U.S., saying Australia is "completely opposed to the death penalty." She said Britain had sought assurances from the U.S. that Assange would not be exposed to the death penalty if he was extradited.
