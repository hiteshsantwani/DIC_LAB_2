Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, facing criticism that the Trump administration has sought to sweep away the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi’s brutal killing, announced on Monday that 16 Saudis, including one of the closest aides to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, were being barred from entry to the United States.
The list included the close aide, Saud al-Qahtani, who officially served as the royal court’s media czar, but appeared to have overseen the operation to seize Mr. Khashoggi. It was one of a dozen or so operations by what American intelligence officials called the Saudi Rapid Intervention Group, set up by Mr. al-Qahtani to silence or eliminate dissent about Prince Mohammed’s rapid rise to become the de facto Saudi leader.
But conspicuously missing from the list is Prince Mohammed himself, despite the conclusion by American intelligence agencies that he was ultimately responsible for sending the team to Istanbul to kill Mr. Khashoggi, and for other actions by the Rapid Intervention Group. More than a year before Mr. Khashoggi’s death, American intelligence officials intercepted a communication from the crown prince saying that if Mr. Khashoggi, a Washington Post journalist who lived in Virginia, did not voluntarily return to the kingdom and cease publishing his criticism, the state should go after him “with a bullet.”
Based on the findings of the C.I.A., which he led until last year, Mr. Pompeo would have been free to add the crown prince to the list, though that would have been an unusual move to take against a leader of a close ally. But Mr. Pompeo has at times also sounded passive about the investigation, saying he was giving the Saudis time to complete their own inquiry.
