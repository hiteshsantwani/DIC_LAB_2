LONDON â€” A case in a London court to extradite Arif Naqvi, the founder of collapsed private equity firm Abraaj, to the United States on fraud charges, was adjourned until April 26, a court official said on Thursday.
The official told Reuters that a former managing partner of Dubai-based Abraaj, Sev Vettivetpillai, had also been arrested and was facing a U.S. extradition request linked to the same charges.
Vettivetpillai could not be reached for a comment.
Whilst at Abraaj, Vettivetpillai was head of impact investing in a role that oversaw the firm's troubled healthcare fund.
Abraaj's executives are facing U.S. charges that they defrauded their investors, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
