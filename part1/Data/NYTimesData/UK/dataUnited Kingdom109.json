WASHINGTON â€” U.S. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday he was still trying to determine the best way to respond to the October murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate, but described the kingdom as an important U.S. ally against Iran.
"We're trying to figure out the best way to" respond, McConnell said at a roundtable meeting with reporters.
"Obviously what clearly happened is outrageous and unacceptable. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia's an important ally against the Iranians. So it is a difficult problem to figure out exactly the most appropriate response."
Members of Congress, including some Senate Republicans as well as Democrats, have been clamoring for Republican President Donald Trump to take a stronger line against Saudi Arabia.
