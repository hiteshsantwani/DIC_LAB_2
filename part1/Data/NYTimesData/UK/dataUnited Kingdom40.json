Sasson tells the story of Sultana, whose uncle King Faisal ruled Saudi Arabia until 1975, and shows how restrictions against women in Saudi Arabia affect even those in the privileged class. Sultana has nine sisters; one, married to a much older, sexually sadistic man, attempted suicide. Another was circumcised. Women in the Kingdom are valued mostly for their reproductive ability, Sasson says, and when Sultana was unable to bear more than five children, her husband tried to take another wife. In later books Sasson also writes about Sultana’s daughters and her social circle.

THE WIND IN MY HAIR
My Fight for Freedom in Modern Iran
By Masih Alinejad
400 pp. Little, Brown. (2018)
“Told poignantly and with a blunt honesty that seems a characteristic of Alinejad’s life and writing, here is a gripping tale that permits us to peek at the inner workings of the Iranian Revolution and consider the question of its health and longevity,” our reviewer wrote. Alinejad’s life has been defined by her rebellions against her society’s restrictions. As a teenager, she helped to print pamphlets calling for greater dissent, and as a young adult she spoke out against a cleric who admonished her for exposing her hair. Now, in her work as a journalist, she writes stories that expose the corruption of the Islamic Republic.
