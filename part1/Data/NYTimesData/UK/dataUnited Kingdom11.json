LONDON â€” The United Kingdom now has until Oct. 31 to leave the European Union but the British political elite is still squabbling over how, when or if to Brexit.
Some EU officials think the United Kingdom could change its mind - a spectacular reversal that would illustrate the bloc's fortitude and keep one of Europe's top powers inside the club.
Eurosceptic supporters of Brexit say the divorce is under threat from what they cast as an undemocratic plot that risks undermining political stability in the United Kingdom.
Below are possible scenarios:
1) NO BREXIT: The fresh delay gives time for the opponents of the divorce to push for a revocation of the formal Article 50 divorce notification, or for a referendum - either via parliament or an election.
