QUITO â€” Ecuador was not aware of any active extradition requests for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange before it terminated his asylum in the country's London embassy on Thursday, the foreign minister told the national assembly.
"At the time the decision to finalize his asylum was made, there was only a case in the United Kingdom for violating the conditions of his bail in 2012," Foreign Minister Jose Valencia told lawmakers in Quito, the capital.
U.S. prosecutors unsealed an indictment against Assange on Thursday, accusing him of conspiring with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to gain access to a government computer as part of one of the largest compromises of classified information in U.S. history.
