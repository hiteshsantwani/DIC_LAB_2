LONDON â€” British employers cut permanent staff-hiring at the fastest rate since mid-2016, a sign that the Brexit tumult may be starting to affect Britain's robust labour market, a survey of recruiters showed on Friday.
Demand for staff grew at the weakest pace since August 2016, shortly after the referendum result for a vote to leave the European Union, according to the monthly KPMG/Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) Report on Jobs.
The report added to a string of downbeat data from businesses ahead of Brexit, despite solid consumer spending and, up to this point, strong employment growth.
"We have a fantastic labour market that has delivered high employment and flexibility for workers because it helps companies meet their needs easily. It's a British success story. But Brexit uncertainty has put the brakes on," REC's chief executive Neil Carberry said.
