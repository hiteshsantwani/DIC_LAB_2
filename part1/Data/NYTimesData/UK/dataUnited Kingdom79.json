STOCKHOLM â€” Sweden's Prosecution Authority will charge three police officers over the fatal shooting of a 20-year old with Down's syndrome and autism in August last year in a case that has raised concerns over the use of deadly force.
Eric Torell, who had the mental age of a three year-old, died in a hail of bullets after sneaking out of his home in Stockholm in the middle of the night to play.
Police fired 25 shots at Torell in a residential courtyard believing a toy pistol he was carrying was a real weapon. Torell, was hit three times. Two of the shots, including the one that killed him, hit him in the back.
"I have decided that the police who have been charged for the shooting did not follow the procedures they should have done and had they done so, they would have realized that Eric - the victim - was not a threat," prosecutor Martin Tiden told reporters.
