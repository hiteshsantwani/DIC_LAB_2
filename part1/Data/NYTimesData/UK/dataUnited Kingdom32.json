LONDON â€” WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was arrested by British police and carried out of the Ecuadorean embassy on Thursday after his South American hosts abruptly revoked his seven-year asylum in a move his supporters said was illegal.
Following are comments and reactions to the news:
BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT
"Julian Assange is no hero, he has hidden from the truth for years and years.
"It's not so much Julian Assange being held hostage in the Ecuadorean embassy, it's actually Julian Assange holding the Ecuadorean embassy hostage in a situation that was absolutely intolerable for them."
BRITISH JUNIOR FOREIGN MINISTER ALAN DUNCAN
"It is our broad policy in all circumstances, so it equally applies to Julian Assange, that he will not be extradited if he is going to face the death penalty. So that will apply to him."
