The children of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi have received tens of thousands of dollars and millions in real estate from the rulers of the kingdom as compensation for the murder of their father by a team of Saudi agents, according to a person close to the family and a former Saudi official familiar with the arrangement.
The payments appear to be part of an attempt to deter the Khashoggi children from speaking out against the kingdom’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom American and other Western intelligence agencies have concluded ordered the killing.
Mr. Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist, had four adult children, at least two of whom are American citizens. Saudi Arabia has now provided each of the four with a house in the family’s home city of Jidda worth about $4 million in addition to a steady stream of cash payments of $10,000 to $15,000 a month, according to the people familiar with the arrangement. All spoke on condition of anonymity because the arrangement is confidential.
The former official said that the crown prince’s father, King Salman, had ordered the payments shortly after he had first learned that Saudi agents had ambushed and killed Mr. Khashoggi, and that the payments were intended as a form of financial support, without conditions, that would continue indefinitely.
