HONG KONG â€” The European Union's markets watchdog should reconsider its ban on trading thousands of shares outside the bloc if there is a no-deal Brexit, a senior French government official said on Wednesday.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) stunned exchanges last month when it said that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, 6,200 mostly EU-listed shares, but also 14 UK stocks, could only be traded on platforms inside the bloc.
London is Europe's biggest share trading centre, used by fund managers from across the continent who would be forced to accept less attractive prices if cut off from Britain.
"The good thing is that ESMA has taken a decision, sometimes you see that in other places it is difficult to have a decision," said Sebastien Raspiller, head of the financial sector department at France's finance ministry.
