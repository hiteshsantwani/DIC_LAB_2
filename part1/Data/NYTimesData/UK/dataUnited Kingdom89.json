FRANKFURT â€” Brexit is a major uncertainty overhanging the euro zone economy, European Central Bank ECB President Mario Draghi said on Thursday, adding that he was "still hopeful" that major disruptions such as breaks in value chains could be averted.

As she battles to get a divorce deal ratified by a divided British parliament, it remains unclear how, when or even if Brexit will happen.
"I think the consequences of Brexit are different whether it is a hard disorderly Brexit or whether it is properly managed with an adequate transition period," Draghi said. "They are having votes every day (in the British parliament) so it would not be right to anticipate one thing or another.
