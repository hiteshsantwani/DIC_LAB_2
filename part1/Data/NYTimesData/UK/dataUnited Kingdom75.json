LONDON â€” The United Kingdom will become the first country in the world to demand age verification for people viewing pornography online when new checks come into force in three months' time, the government said on Wednesday.
From July 15, commercial providers of online pornography will have to carry out age checks on users to ensure they are 18 or over, the government said.
Websites that break the new law risk having their payment services withdrawn or being blocked in Britain.
"Adult content is currently far too easy for children to access online," Britain's minister for digital and creative industries, Margot James, said.
