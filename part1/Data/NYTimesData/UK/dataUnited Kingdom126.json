Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials took the rapper 21 Savage into custody on Sunday for being in the United States illegally, according to an agency spokesman.
21 Savage, whose real name is Sha Yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, was arrested during an operation by federal and local law enforcement authorities in Atlanta, the spokesman, Bryan D. Cox, said in a statement.
Mr. Abraham-Joseph is an “unlawfully present United Kingdom national” who legally entered the United States in 2005 but was supposed to leave the next year, according to the terms of his nonimmigrant visa, Mr. Cox said.
