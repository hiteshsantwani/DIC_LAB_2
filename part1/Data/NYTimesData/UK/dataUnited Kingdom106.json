LOS ANGELES â€” The creators of global smash television series "Game of Thrones" say they knew how they would end the show five years ago, and are anxious that fans will like it.
"We want people to love it. It matters a lot to us," said D.B. Weiss, who along with David Benioff created the series that is based on the novels of George R.R. Martin.
"We also know that no matter what we do, even if it's the optimal version, that a certain number of people will hate the best of all possible versions," Weiss told Entertainment Weekly in an interview that was published on Tuesday.
The final six episodes of HBO's award-winning medieval fantasy series set among warring families in the fictional kingdom of Westeros launches on Sunday and concludes on May 19.
