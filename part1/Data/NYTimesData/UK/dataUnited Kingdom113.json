"At the time the decision to finalize his asylum was made, there was only a case in the United Kingdom for violating the conditions of his bail in 2012," Valencia told lawmakers.
U.S. prosecutors unsealed an indictment against Assange on Thursday, accusing him of conspiring with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to gain access to a government computer as part of one of the largest compromises of classified information in U.S. history.
Assange faces up to five years in prison on the American charge, the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement.
Assange and WikiLeaks have intervened in Ecuadorean affairs, Interior Minister Maria Paula Romo told reporters in Quito, and at least one Russian hacker involved with the organization is living in the country.
She would not confirm whether the hacker was involved in the creation of web pages that accuse Moreno of corruption, but said they had participated in the creation of a page later spread by WikiLeaks.
"We hope it will be the Ecuadorean justice system which will confirm the exact relationship," Romo said.
Romo on Thursday night said Ecuador had detained a person "very close" to WikiLeaks who is associated with former Ecuadorean foreign minister Ricardo Patino.
