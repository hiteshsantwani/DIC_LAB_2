LONDON — When executives from Saudi Aramco, the giant oil company in Saudi Arabia, pitched prospective investors on the company’s first international bond offering last week, they were shown the red carpet everywhere.
In central London, investors crowded into a room at the upscale Corinthia Hotel to hear details of the deal. In New York, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, made a rare appearance to talk up the bond sale.
All signs are that investors are eager for any piece of Aramco they can get — despite concerns about how closely its fortunes are tied to its owner, the government of Saudi Arabia, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Prince Mohammed’s connection to the murder of a prominent journalist and dissident, Jamal Khashoggi, caused a storm among politicians and members of the media. Yet demand for Aramco bonds has topped $60 billion, said a person briefed on the matter who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the deal — far surpassing the company’s initial goal of selling about $10 billion worth of debt. The company’s bankers are expected to set the price of its bonds on Tuesday.
