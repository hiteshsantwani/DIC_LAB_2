Good Thursday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.

• Beto O’Rourke, whose near-miss Senate run last year propelled him to Democratic stardom, joined the race for president this morning. In the crowded and competitive primary field, his entrance adds to the mix a relentless campaigner with a small-dollar fund-raising army. Here’s where he stands on the issues.
• Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, will serve seven and a half years in prison, after a federal judge nearly doubled his sentence, denouncing him as a man who “spent a significant portion of his career gaming the system.” It’s still far less than he could’ve served.
• Mr. Manafort has also been charged in New York with mortgage fraud and more than a dozen other state felonies, in an effort by the Manhattan district attorney to ensure he will still face prison time if Mr. Trump pardons him for his federal crimes.
