WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared on Wednesday that China is “in a league of its own when it comes to human rights violations,” and one of his top officials compared Beijing’s roundup of Muslim minorities to movements into camps not seen “since the 1930s.”
The official, Michael Kozak, who heads the State Department’s human rights bureau, did not explicitly mention Nazi Germany or the creation of concentration camps, but that was clearly the comparison he was making.
Taken together, the statements amounted to the most direct condemnation the United States has made to the roundup of millions of Uighurs and other minorities. The charge is bound to inflame the government in Beijing at a moment of high tension in trade talks and the standoff over Huawei, the Chinese communications giant seeking to operate in many Western markets.
The detention camps in China’s western Xinjiang region have expanded since 2017 to include an estimated one million Uighurs, Kazakhs and other Muslims in a program that tries to turn them into loyal supporters of the Chinese government. The camps have been broadly condemned, including by the United Nations, but China has brushed off the criticism; one official as recently as Tuesday likened them to “boarding schools where the students eat and live for free.”
