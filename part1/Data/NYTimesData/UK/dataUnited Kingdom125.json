LONDON â€” Two environmental activists climbed onto the roof of a train in London's Canary Wharf financial district on Wednesday as part of a third day of action to force Britain to take more radical measures to avert climate change.
The Extinction Rebellion group has ratcheted up its protests in recent weeks, blocking Marble Arch, Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge, smashing a door at the Shell building and shocking lawmakers with a semi-nude protest in parliament.
Nearly 300 people have been arrested so far this week after campaigners blocked some of the capital's most iconic locations, many camping in tents on the streets.
The group advocates non-violent civil disobedience to force governments to reduce carbon emissions and avert what it says is a global climate crisis that will bring starvation, floods, wildfires and social collapse.
