"But the failure to do that and this focus on holding the party together, in my view is an unedifying spectacle." said one former aide.
Her frustration after almost two years of EU talks boiled over in her March 20 TV address.
"You are tired of the infighting. You are tired of the political games and the arcane procedural rows," she said. "You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with. I agree. I'm on your side."
The backlash was swift, with some lawmakers accusing May of encouraging violence against them in an unashamedly populist speech.
ELECTION DISASTER
It all started to go wrong less than a year after May became prime minister.
When she took over, the Conservatives held a slim majority in parliament. May had always said she wouldn't call an election to reinforce her legitimacy but by early 2017 she was riding high in the polls and saw an opportunity to boost her majority and, hopefully, make the Brexit process smoother.
She triggered a snap election in June 2017 but it didn't go well.
May was uncomfortable with a campaign which she thought was trying to make her look presidential but did "not suit her in any way", the former aide said.
Her poll lead dwindled and while the Conservatives did win the most seats in parliament, May lost her majority and was forced to turn to the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to stay in power.
"You can look at the election in two ways. You can say, 'Well, she's the PM, she should have taken control, said it wasn't working and changed it'," the former aide said.
