1. President Trump declared a national emergency to try and build a border wall that Congress refused to give him.
“We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we’re going to do it one way or the other,” he said in a televised announcement at the White House, above. “It’s an invasion,” he added. “We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country.”
Nearly all of Mr. Trump’s claims about the southern border were misleading, exaggerated or false.
House Democrats plan to introduce legislation to block the president’s move. If approved by Congress, it would put the president in the position of issuing the first veto of his presidency. Here’s what might happen next.
