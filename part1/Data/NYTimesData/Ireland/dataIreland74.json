If there’s an upside to the crushing defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May’s laboriously negotiated plan for withdrawing from the European Union, it is that staring in the face of an exit without a deal 10 weeks from now may finally compel British lawmakers to accept reality.
That was far from evident in the immediate aftermath of the 432-to-202 vote in Parliament on Tuesday. Though it was the worst drubbing a British government had suffered in modern times and a dangerous step toward the cliff’s edge, the vote was cheered by many sides — by hard-core Brexiteers who would sever ties to the Continent at any cost; by “remainers” for whom any glitch in the Brexit process keeps alive the hope of staying in the union or at least softening the terms of a divorce; by Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn, who wants to oust Mrs. May so he can come to power.
Mr. Corbyn’s ambitions, at least, were dashed for the moment when many of the politicians from Mrs. May’s camp who defied her on Tuesday came to her support on Wednesday, opting to keep her in office rather than risk an election in which they had no acceptable alternative candidate.
On the Continent, the exasperation was tangible. “If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?” asked Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, which includes the European Union’s heads of state and government, in a tweet that implied that the solution should be for Britain to stay in the union.
