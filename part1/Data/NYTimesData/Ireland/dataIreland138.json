PRETORIA â€” Bulls coach Pote Human has called on six Springboks for the home Super Rugby clash against the Queensland Reds at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday, but will rest powerful number eight Duane Vermeulen with one eye on the Rugby World Cup in Japan.
The inconsistent Bulls let a late lead slip against the Jaguares last weekend, much to the irritation of Human, and he has freshened up the side for the visit of the Reds.
Boks Handre Pollard and Jesse Kriel return at flyhalf and centre respectively after they were rested against the Jaguares at the request of South African Rugby, who have devised a playing schedule for key individuals in this World Cup year.
Ivan van Zyl is back at scrumhalf, while Warrick Gelant returns to the fullback position after overcoming injury.
