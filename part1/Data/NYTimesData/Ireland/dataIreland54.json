BRUSSELS â€” A 'no-deal' Brexit makes no sense and is the worst possible Brexit outcome, European Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan said on Monday.
Asked about comments made by some in the British Conservative Party, such as the party's leader in the House of Commons, that a no-deal Brexit would be "not nearly as grim" as many people think, Irishman Hogan replied:
"Despite the madness of Brexit, I still believe that common sense might prevail. I hope it does. No deal makes no sense. It's simply crazy. There's too much at stake."
"There's no such thing as a good outcome in relation to Brexit, but I believe that a no-deal Brexit is the worst of all outcomes."
