The idea that the diaspora experience is central to America’s narrative is famously expressed in Emma Lazarus’s sonnet at the Statue of Liberty, with its celebrated line, “Give me your tired, your poor/Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”
Our immigration ethos, and an exploration of immigrants’ contributions to American arts and culture, are at the heart of Carnegie Hall’s Migrations: The Making of America festival, which is set to begin on March 9 and run through May 19, and will include concerts at the hall, as well as programming at 80 partner institutions around New York. (Each organization produces its own events.)

The goal, according to Clive Gillinson, Carnegie Hall’s executive and artistic director, is to examine the indelible link between the mass movement of people over the past century and American history. “We are inviting audiences to look more closely at how the migrations of people to and within this country, and the evolution of art forms that they have developed here, have been powerful influences on the creation and development of American culture,” he said in a statement.
Carnegie Hall will amplify the musical legacies of three migrations: the arrival of Eastern European and Russian Jews between 1881 and 1924; the Irish and Scottish migrations of the 18th and 19th centuries; and the Great Migration of African-Americans from the rural South to the big cities of the Northeast, Midwest and West between 1917 and the 1970s.
