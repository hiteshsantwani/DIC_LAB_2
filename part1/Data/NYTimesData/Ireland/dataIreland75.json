Conor McGregor has retired and un-retired before, so it is possible he will return to the Ultimate Fighting Championship.
But if McGregor, who loves to talk as much as he loves to fight and loves to win, has indeed left the sport for good after months of career and legal troubles, U.F.C. will be without its most popular and recognizable fighter just as it is trying to expand its footprint in a crowded sports landscape.
“In the short run, they’ll miss the attention that Conor gives them, no doubt,” said Marshall Zelaznik, who spent 10 years as a U.F.C. executive before leaving in 2016. “For the longevity of a promotion, you need these kinds of stars.”

U.F.C. has churned out other athletes with crossover appeal. Jon Jones, the first mixed martial artist with a Nike signature shoe, recently returned from a 15-month doping suspension. Ronda Rousey, who has become a professional wrestler, regularly drew huge pay-per-view audiences as recently as 2016.
