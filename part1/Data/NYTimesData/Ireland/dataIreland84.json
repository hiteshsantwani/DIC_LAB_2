Chloe Jackson's driving layup with 3.9 seconds left Sunday night lifted top-seeded Baylor to an 82-81 win over defending champion Notre Dame for the NCAA Women's National Championship at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla.
Jackson pumped in 26 points on 13-of-25 shooting for the Lady Bears (37-1), who joined Connecticut and Tennessee as the only women's programs to win at least three national titles. Baylor's previous championships came in 2005 and 2012.
The Fighting Irish (35-4) had a chance to force overtime, but Arike Ogunbowale missed the first of two foul shots with 1.9 seconds remaining. She tried to miss the second on purpose, hoping for an offensive rebound, but made it. The Bears were able to melt away the remaining time just trying to inbound the ball.
Baylor hung on despite losing 6-foot-4 junior Lauren Cox to a left leg injury in the closing minutes of the third quarter. The Lady Bears led by 12 at the time, and the Irish wasted little time taking advantage.
