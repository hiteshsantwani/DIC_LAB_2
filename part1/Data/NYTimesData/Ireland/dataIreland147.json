Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande have passed No. 1 on the Billboard chart to someone new: Hozier.
Andrew Hozier-Byrne, the Irish singer-songwriter who performs as Hozier, has topped the latest chart with his second album, “Wasteland, Baby!” (Rubyworks/Columbia), which had the equivalent of 89,000 sales in the United States, according to Nielsen. Of that total, 75,000 were for sales of the full album, helped by a deal that bundled copies of the album with tickets for Hozier’s latest tour.
“Wasteland, Baby!” is Hozier’s first No. 1. His last album, “Hozier,” from 2014, reached as high as No. 2, and contained “Take Me to Church,” which received a Grammy nomination for song of the year. (It lost out to Sam Smith’s “Stay With Me.”)
Also this week, Grande’s “Thank U, Next” holds at No. 2, and Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s “A Star Is Born” soundtrack fell two spots to No. 3. Next are two new rap albums, with 2 Chainz’s “Rap or Go to the League” opening at No. 4 and Lil Skies’ “Shelby” starting at No. 5.
Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” soundtrack is No. 6, and Solange’s new “When I Get Home” opened at No. 7.
