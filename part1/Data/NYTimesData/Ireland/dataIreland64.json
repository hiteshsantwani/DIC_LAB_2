This month marks the beginning of the end for “Game of Thrones,” the globally popular HBO hit that will kick off its final season on April 14. But beginning next year, “Thrones” fans will be able to get their Westeros fix in person.
HBO is turning one of the show’s former studios in Northern Ireland into a 110,000-square-foot tourist attraction. The Game of Thrones Studio Tour will be an interactive exhibition of the show’s sets, costumes, weapons and other props, and include exhibits that break down how the technically ambitious fantasy blockbuster was made. It will open in spring 2020.
“It’s going to be an immersive experience where fans will feel like they are inside their favorite sets from the show,” said Jeff Peters, HBO’s vice president for licensing and retail.
