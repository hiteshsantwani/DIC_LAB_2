LONDON — Twenty-eight women dragged 28 suitcases across Westminster bridge in London this week to protest restrictive abortion laws in Northern Ireland and demand the expansion of abortion rights.
The number of protesters was not random: The 28 demonstrators symbolized “the 28 women who are forced to make the lonely journey to England to access abortion services every week,” Grainne Teggart, the Northern Ireland campaign manager for Amnesty International, said in a phone interview on Wednesday.
The women — including members of the British Parliament and television stars — marched on Tuesday to the office of Karen Bradley, a Conservative member of Parliament and the Northern Ireland Secretary in Westminster. They carried with them a petition started by Amnesty International asking the British government to take action to reform Northern Ireland’s abortion law.
“Northern Ireland is now isolated as the only part of the U.K. and Ireland with a near total abortion ban,” Ms. Teggart said in a statement on Tuesday. “This is unacceptable.”
