“Maze” is, on its surface, an escape movie, but its true appeal lies elsewhere. Closely based on the 1983 mass breakout from the notorious Maze prison in Northern Ireland, Stephen Burke’s careful drama hits the familiar genre bases with almost soothing efficiency. Yet underneath the plotting and internecine tussles of the would-be escapees lurks something much more interesting: the story of a seduction.
The seducer is the real-life Larry Marley (a superb Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), an Irish Republican Army prisoner still smarting from the deaths of fellow hunger strikers some months earlier. (At the time, the I.R.A. was engaged in a violent struggle to free Northern Ireland from English rule.) A hard, pale man with intelligent eyes and a deceptively compliant manner, Marley knows that any escape from this fortress will require information only the guards possess. Accordingly, he embarks on a campaign to gain the trust of Gordon (Barry Ward), an officer he instinctively recognizes as more conflicted and vulnerable than the others.
