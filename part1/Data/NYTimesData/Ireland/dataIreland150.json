(Reuters) - Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards has reversed his decision to become Wigan Warriors head coach at the end of the season, the English Super League club said on Monday.
The rugby league team announced last August that Edwards, 52, would be the new coach of his hometown club on a three-year contract after the 2019 World Cup in Japan.
However, British media have reported that Edwards is set to extend his 11-year stay with Wales after winning the Six Nations Grand Slam this year as part of Warren Gatland's backroom staff.
"I will not be taking up the head coaching role at Wigan, the reason being my lack of preparation," Edwards said in a statement issued by Wigan.
