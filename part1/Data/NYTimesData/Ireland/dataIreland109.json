ACROSTIC — Sunday, March 17, is St. Patrick’s Day, and team Cox Rathvon has chosen an appropriate passage, from a book called “Irish Leprechaun Stories” by Bairbre McCarthy, a Gaelic name if ever there was.
Leprechauns make me think of “Finian’s Rainbow,” a movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola that I saw many years ago in a class, taught by a Coppola fanatic. I remember the movie as being extremely out there, and if you’re reading this on Saturday, March 16, you can actually catch it on Turner Classic Movies tonight (this whole notion seems so old-fashioned in the streaming era, but old films like this aren’t always easy to find on demand). I won’t recommend the horror movies starring a malevolent example (of a leprechaun, not a film studies professor), but they are out there, too, and probably available to view on this holiday. There’s also this odd “SCTV” sketch starring John Candy.
