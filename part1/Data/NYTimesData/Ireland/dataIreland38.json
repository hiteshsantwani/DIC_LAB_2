DUBLIN — Irish insulation company Kingspan has made a 700 million euro (£605 million) offer for the insulation and flexible foams units of Belgium's Recticel, it said on Tuesday.
The company has also struck a deal with a third party to sell on the flexible foams businesses if the acquisition goes ahead, it said.
The deal would tighten Kingspan's grip on the European insulation market, where Recticel's unit has manufacturing facilities in Belgium, France, Britain and Slovenia.
Recticel's board will analyse the proposal in line with its fiduciary duty and update the market, the Brussels-based company said in a statement.
