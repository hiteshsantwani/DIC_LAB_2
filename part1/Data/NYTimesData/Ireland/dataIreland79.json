DUBLIN â€” The European Union's chief Brexit negotiator said he hoped cross-party crisis talks in London would yield a positive outcome to allow his team to move swiftly in agreeing more ambitions terms on a future British-EU relationship.
Britain's exit from the EU hangs in the balance with Prime Minister Theresa May trying to coax the Labour Party into agreeing a divorce deal with a better chance of being ratified by the British parliament, two days before an emergency summit where she will try to delay the April 12 departure.
"We all hope that these talks will produce a positive outcome. I've said many times before, we can be more, much more ambitious in our future relationship with the UK," Michel Barnier told a news conference with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in Dublin.
"The political declaration provides for a range of outcomes including a customs union. We are ready to make this clearer if it helps and this work can be done extremely quickly."
