TOULOUSE, France — Former France coach Guy Noves is entitled to one million euros (£862,415) in compensation for wrongful dismissal by the national rugby federation, a French court said on Monday.
The FFR alleged Noves was guilty of serious misconduct, but a Toulouse labour tribunal decided otherwise. Noves was asking for 2.88 million euros.
Both parties have the right to appeal, although initial reactions suggested that they had accepted the outcome.
"I am satisfied with this decision. The FFR said there was serious misconduct and the tribunal said there was none," Noves, the first France rugby union coach to be sacked, told reporters.
