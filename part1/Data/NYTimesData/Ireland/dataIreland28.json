No spoilers on this week’s podcast, we swear. Patrick Radden Keefe talks about his new book, “Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland.” The book begins in December 1972, when 38-year-old Jean McConville, a mother of 10 and recently widowed, was taken from her home by a group of masked intruders who abducted her in front of her children. “Say Nothing” uses the central mystery of what exactly happened that night, and why, to also investigate the history of the Troubles in Ireland and write about the lives of many people involved on each side of the conflict.
Keefe eventually reveals (in the book, not on the podcast!) exactly what happened to McConville.
“In doing that,” he says of detailing McConville’s fate, “I’m drafting on an incredibly brave effort by her children, starting in the 1990s, to come out and break the code of silence in Ireland, and say: ‘We need to know what happened to our mother. We’ve been waiting decades for answers, for a body.’ And I think it took great courage for them to do that.”

Frans de Waal visits us this week to discuss “Mama’s Last Hug: Animal Emotions and What They Tell Us About Ourselves.” “I think animal intelligence and emotions are completely intertwined,” he says. “Also in humans, I think, you cannot separate the two. You can barely think without emotions, and you can barely have emotions if there’s not some cognition involved.”
