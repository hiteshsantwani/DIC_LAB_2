Mr. Adams has denied the characterizations of his behavior as abusive or manipulative and challenged the accuracy of The Times’ reporting, though he apologized on Twitter “to anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally.” Mr. Adams has also denied he has ever engaged in sexual communications with someone he knew was underage.
The allegations led to a rapid response in the United States: Mr. Adams’s next album, “Big Colors,” was put on hold indefinitely. Two musical equipment companies that worked with the singer also suspended their relationships with Mr. Adams. Several musicians who had worked with him spoke out in support of the women who made the accusations.
But uncertainty had remained over Mr. Adams’s tour of Britain and Ireland despite fans calling for refunds online and in the British media. One fan who paid more than $200 to attend “Ryan’s pinball lair experience” at a concert, a form of V.I.P. package, told The Guardian that she had felt “physically sick” after reading the allegations in The Times. “I don’t want to support such a person,” she added.
Despite the pressure, SJM Concerts did not respond to media requests about the tour until Friday.
Earlier this week, it appeared that the tour would go on. On Tuesday, a spokesman for London’s Royal Albert Hall, which was to host two concerts, said in an email that SJM Concerts had advised them the concerts were happening.
