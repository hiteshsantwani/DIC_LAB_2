The #MeToo movement has swept across television and movie studios, investment banks and factory floors, fundamentally remaking the thinking around gender and harassment.
Has it also swept into a corner of one of the country’s biggest celebrations of Irish heritage?
For the first time since its founding shortly after the Revolutionary War, a group that puts on a formal dinner to raise money for charity just before the St. Patrick’s Day parade in New York City will allow women to attend.
Specifically, the Society of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in the City of New York is inviting “the wives, daughters, sisters, mothers, aunts, nieces and female cousins, friends and colleagues of our members” to its dinner at the New York Hilton.
It has taken only 235 years. And it has only been 30 years since a woman led the St. Patrick’s Day parade as grand marshal for the first time.
