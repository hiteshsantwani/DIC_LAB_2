DUBLIN â€” Ireland's Central Bank has requested from government the power to activate a so-called systemic risk buffer that would impose additional capital requirements on banks to further protect the economy, Governor Philip Lane said on Tuesday.
Systemic risk buffers have been applied in some other European Union economies. Lane said that, for Ireland, the aim would be to add resilience against "tail risks" - economic shocks unlikely to occur but which would have a significant impact on the economy and financial system if they did.
Lane said the main such risk facing Ireland - leaving aside Brexit - is its high dependence on multinational firms and that if there were a persistent shock to that sector, the cumulative economic decline "would dwarf a normal cyclical recession."
Ireland is the European home for firms such as Google and Facebook that account for around one-in-ten jobs among the country's two million workers, and contribute almost 20 percent of the state's total tax revenues via corporation tax.
