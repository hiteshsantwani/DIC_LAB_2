(Reuters) - Chris Woakes believes it would be unfair for England selectors to ask any player to make way for the uncapped all-rounder Jofra Archer in the World Cup squad.
Barbados-born Archer, who shone for Sussex last season and in Australia's Big Bash Twenty20 league for Hobart Hurricanes, is eligible for national selection under new England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB) residency rules.
Archer's ability to bowl at over 90 miles per hour and his lower-order power-hitting skills have earned him a number of high-profile admirers including England regulars Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler.
Some are concerned about who would be left out if he were to join the England squad, however.
"If he was to come in and someone was to miss out, it would be extremely unfortunate," all-rounder Woakes told BBC Sport.
