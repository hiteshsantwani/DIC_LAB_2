Chloe Jackson's driving layup with 3.9 seconds left Sunday night lifted top-seeded Baylor to an 82-81 win over defending champion Notre Dame for the NCAA Women's National Championship at Amalie Arena in Tampa.
Jackson pumped in 26 points on 13-of-25 shooting for the Bears (37-1), which joined Connecticut and Tennessee as the only women's programs to win at least three national titles. Baylor's previous championships came in 2005 and 2012.
The Fighting Irish (35-4) had a chance to force overtime, but Arike Ogunbowale missed the first of two foul shots with 1.9 seconds remaining. She tried to miss the second on purpose, hoping for an offensive rebound, but made it. The Bears were able to melt away the remaining time.
Ogunbowale scored a game-high 31 points on 11-of-27 shooting, while Marina Mabrey added 21. Brianna Turner contributed 12 points, 12 rebounds and five assists, and Jessica Shepard chipped in 11 points and 10 rebounds.
