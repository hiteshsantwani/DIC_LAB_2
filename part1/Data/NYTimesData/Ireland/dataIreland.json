in say nothing a true story of murder and memory in northern ireland patrick radden keefe trains a cold eye on an incendiary subject despite having irish ancestors who immigrated to the united states in the 19th century keefe a journalist for the new yorker shares little of the tribal solidarity with the old country that was ubiquitous in boston where he grew up i never felt any particular interest in the conflict in northern ireland he writes whatever feeling he had about the troubles the vicious fighting between the mostly protestant loyalists who wanted to remain british subjects and the mostly catholic republicans who didn t amounted to a detached concern it s a somewhat startling admission coming toward the end of this resolutely humane book but an outsider s perspective is what gives say nothing its exacting and terrifying lucidity the title comes from a poem by seamus heaney that describes the famous northern reticence the tight gag of place and times keefe s book is as much about this penumbra of silence as it is about lives lost and blood shed the book begins with a longstanding mystery who abducted jean mcconville and why mcconville was a mother of 10 born to protestants and married to a catholic so overwhelmed by the daunting task of caring for her brood after her husband died that she seemed to have no time for anything else much less sectarian intrigue yet in december 1972 at the end of the bloodiest year of the troubles a group of masked men and women barged into her belfast home dragging the 38 year old widow away as her frightened children looked on  the irish backstop a portion of the agreement for britain s planned withdrawal from the european union has been a near constant point of tension since the country began the brexit process but the two players most affected by the potential outcome of this particular element of the exit ireland an independent nation that will remain a part of the european union after britain s exit and northern ireland a region that is part of the united kingdom and is set to leave the bloc often get left out of the conversation so what do ireland and northern ireland want as britain heads toward the next brexit deadline and can both be satisfied what is the backstop and why is it a factor ireland and northern ireland have recently enjoyed cooperation across their shared border which for decades had been a pressure point in sectarian struggles known as the troubles  but as anyone who goes to the border discovers you can t ignore the past talk to people in northern ireland and they ll bring up events from decades or even centuries ago with a visceral emotion that would make you think they d happened just last week investigators are still churning up the soil searching for the bodies of people who were murdered during the troubles and buried in secret graves make no mistake the border is a scar and the scar is about to open brexit has foundered in no small measure on the question of how to cope with the irish border prime minister theresa may has promised future technological innovations that would allow for a frictionless customs border but for the moment that is magical thinking under the withdrawal agreement rejected for a third time on friday both the united kingdom and the european union are committed to a backstop which in the event that they have failed to negotiate a future relationship by the end of 2020 would prevent the abrupt reintroduction of a hard border but that is at best a temporary measure will the violence return it already has in january a car bomb exploded in derry this month a dissident group claimed responsibility for several unexploded letter bombs that were sent from ireland to london and glasgow i don t believe that we will see a return to the full blown violence of the troubles the paramilitary groups that oppose the good friday agreement are marginal players with none of the resources or popular support that empowered the i r a and others but then conflicts seldom start because most of the population wants them to the troubles ignited in the first place in large measure because limited acts of violence were met with irrational escalation station a customs man at a border crossing and kids are going to throw rocks at him so you bring in the cops to stand guard then some fool with a rifle shoots a cop what happens next one solution which the european union proposed last year was to shift the border for customs purposes into the irish sea so northern ireland and the republic could trade without barriers the british government rejected this idea on the grounds that doing so would undermine the unity of the united kingdom it s a further measure of the brexiteers naïveté that they don t realize that by forcing northern ireland to choose between the united kingdom and europe they may have inadvertently hastened the eventual reunification of ireland some prominent irish republicans have already called for a referendum on the question of irish unity how strange to think it could be brexit that finally gets the british out of ireland an outcome that three decades of appalling violence failed to achieve   what s next for northern ireland it is about who owned the language or got the most out of it yes the times were known as the troubles but as the belfast writer jan carson puts it in her upcoming novel the fire starters troubles is too less a word for all of this it is a word for minor inconveniences such as overdrawn bank accounts slow punctures a woman s time of the month it is not a violent word so the i r a invented the armed struggle violence joins injustice it was the work of a marketing genius and the solid conviction of hundreds thousands of men and women it was their war their struggle what keefe captures best though is the tragedy the damage and waste and the idea of moral injury dolours price and many like her believed that after the signing of the good friday agreement in 1998 she had been robbed of any moral justification for the bombings and abductions the last section of the book the tricky part of the story life after violence after the end the unfinished business the disappeared and the refusal of jean mcconville s children to forget about her i wondered as i read if keefe was going to carry it off he does he deals very well with the war s strange ending the victory that wasn t while much of the language of say nothing takes me back to my youth a new word makes its appearance on one of the final pages brexit it would be ironic to say the least keefe writes if one inadvertent long term consequence of the brexit referendum was a united ireland an outcome that three decades of appalling bloodshed and some 3 500 lost lives had failed to achieve a more likely outcome i fear is a fresh border dividing ireland right on top of the old one when the republic of ireland and britain joined what became the european union on the same day in 1973 the border immediately started to become less relevant the e u is a big part the boring part of the story the border is there but hard to discern spot the border is a popular game with people driving across it driving north the kilometers become miles and the road signs are in english instead of both english and gaelic but there s no evidence of the checkpoints or observation towers that were there before the good friday agreement since the brexit referendum much has been said and promised about soft borders and hard borders but as someone observed i can t remember who all borders are hard and the line across ireland will be the only land border dividing britain from the e u there will be checkpoints there might also be observation towers there will be men and women in uniform there might also be armed soldiers with english and scottish accents there will be trouble and there might also be troubles say nothing is an excellent account of the troubles it might also be a warning  to the editor re how a no deal brexit could create irish unity news article feb 16 twenty years of peace in the aftermath of the good friday agreement cannot mask the continued commitment of the irish to the ultimate reunification of ireland here in america as well as there there are no good options for the british parliament as it wrestles with what to do about the open border between the two irelands after brexit either the border remains open as majorities in both irelands want which would mean that northern ireland remains in the european union as the rest of britain secedes or a hard border is reinstated threatening economic livelihoods on both sides and potentially reigniting the troubles those of us who are committed to preventing a hard border have been meeting with leaders on both sides of the atlantic to let london know that we are prepared to bring whatever pressure we can muster against a post brexit american british trade agreement unless the border stays open it should be lost on no one that northern ireland along with scotland where brexit has reignited independence passions as well voted to remain in the european union all of the irish desire to remain in the union and the british ignore that desire at their peril  twenty years have passed since the good friday agreement to a german visiting northern ireland a couple of similarities with my own country reunited 30 years ago spring to mind social cleavages have softened but not vanished a heavily protected barrier that once was a symbol of unnatural separation has given way to a natural coalescence but unlike in germany the former oppressor is still a political player in northern ireland germany has its regional differences but there is no doubt that we are all germans not so on the island where resentment at what is seen as english highhandedness runs rife and where few believe that things will be any better post brexit mr o rawe worried that a new visible dividing line on the island would revive ancient division and anger a hard border would cement the injustice that has been historically perpetrated against the irish people he said it would be presented as the british government asserting a warped definition of democracy in ireland to suit their own agenda and would energize the adage that britain only respects one thing the barrel of a gun in the 2016 brexit referendum a majority of people in northern ireland 55 8 percent voted to remain in the european union this means that it would be dragged out of the union against its will and in particular against the will of its irish nationalists support for independence and a reunification with the irish republic is growing in london prime minister theresa may has vowed to respect the peace accord and avoid a hard border in ireland but neither she nor anyone else has yet explained how not to control a border that separates a european union country from a nonunion country mrs may s brexit plan leaves open the possibility of at least customs checks along the border without a plan in place a hard border will almost certainly be needed mr o rawe believes that the british government preoccupied with political strife in westminster has given no thought to what brexit might bring in terms of violent republican reaction they see a weak dissident campaign at present he said and tell themselves that they ve nothing to worry about but they are blinkered fools in january just a few miles from were i met the angry local man a car bomb exploded in the center of derry no one was injured luckily but

words of the poet seamus heaney ended the troubles remarkably it has held the peace while essentially erasing the border between the republic of ireland and the swath of historic ulster belonging to britain no one wants to put up guard stations and customs checks along the invisible 310 mile line separating prosperous ireland a member of the e u from the shakily peaceful six counties of the north which would exit and only the most hateful elements on both sides want a return of violence that is sure to come with a hard border the solution it s there in the not so fine print of the peace agreement should a majority of northern ireland residents desire to leave britain it is required to call for a vote of those people that majority is fast approaching what prime minister theresa may of britain calls our precious union is held together by 10 members of parliament representing the old hatreds of north ireland the democratic unionist party it was founded by ian paisley a bigot with a bible who opposed the peace agreement and referred to catholics as scum who multiply like vermin keefe quotes an english journalist as saying that the unionists are more british than the british about whom the british care not at all paisley is no longer with us nor is most of the dark sentiment he stirred up when the borders came down so did many of the walls of religion and nationality catholics long a persecuted minority will soon be a majority in northern ireland if demographic trends continue but the conflict is less about one christian sect against another it s more about how to thrive in an interconnected world the republic of ireland is proudly progressive led by an openly gay taoiseach leo varadkar who is of irish and indian heritage after a series of scandals the influence of the catholic church has greatly diminished last year ireland had the fastest growing economy in europe  in 1916 irish nationalists sparked the easter rising a bloody revolt against the british who had controlled ireland for some 700 years they failed in their immediate goal and many of them were executed or jailed in retribution but the violence left behind a wave of separatist sentiment across the island three years later with the ink from the armistice ending world war i still drying and president woodrow wilson calling for political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike the surviving nationalists realized they had a second chance on jan 21 1919 they declared independence ireland was probably not on wilson s mind when he uttered those words wary of alienating britain he and other world leaders did not look kindly on the irish cause and yet ireland a wee speck of an island with a diasporic population spanning the globe manifested wilson s vision for a postwar world that squared national self determination the diplomatic buzzword of the age with international cooperation state autonomy with global alliances the events of jan 21 began at the mansion house in dublin where 27 nationalists met to form the dail eireann ireland s first self governing assembly outside more than a thousand people gathered in the streets some climbing lampposts to gain a better view inside guests priests and the press filled the floor and gallery of the mansion s round room elected representatives of the sinn fein party mostly young men with no gray hairs among them reported the irish times entered with countenances of funereal solemnity then from a table draped in green baize the assembly delivered a declaration of independence announced its democratic program publicly implored the free nations of the world to recognize their new government and enacted a provisional constitution under which it would operate the new york times called the proceedings dull because they were held in irish which few of the people in the room understood this was a tribute to sentiment the newspaper explained but it was deadening to interest lost in translation was the soaring rhetoric that voiced ireland s commitment to both its own interests and those of the global community fixing irish independence firmly in the promised era of self determination and liberty  what is your name for the playground game in which one child chases the rest and anyone who is touched becomes the pursuer for each question choose whichever answer comes

that bit of bread on the table a roll a bap or a bun and do the words but and put rhyme when you say them out loud the answers to these questions and others like them divide the various regions of ireland and britain just as much as say the question of soda pop or coke splits the united states the way that people speak the particular words they use and how they sound is deeply tied to their sense of identity and it s not just about geography education gender age ethnicity and other social variables influence speech patterns too these dialect markers are so ingrained into people s sense of self that they tend to persist well after they move away from home identity is what underlies most people s retention of at least some of their local features said clive upton professor emeritus of english language at the university of leeds because ultimately what we say is who we are in ireland and britain the local dialect can change wildly just 10 or 20 miles down the road there s a vast amount of variation over a small area especially when compared with a place like the united states language differentiation takes time so the longer a language has to simmer in one location the more diverse it becomes said raymond hickey a professor of linguistics at the university of duisburg essen english speakers first settled in ireland in the late 12th century and old english has its beginnings in no surprise england almost 1 600 years ago so it has had plenty of time to diversify do you have suggestions or english language regionalisms that you re curious about please let us know for dialectologists the patterns of people s speech reveal a great deal about the historical development of the english language regional dialect variation allows you to hear echoes of earlier forms of the language it isn t just about chronicling oh that s a funny noise or oh that s a strange word mr upton said underneath all that it s very seriously trying to get to grips with the question of how language changes and the english language is always changing while some of the finer village by village accent distinctions in ireland and britain are eroding there is no evidence that regional speech differences are about to disappear regardless of technological changes we are not about to start all speaking the same way anytime soon that s not how language works people always form linguistic communities each with its own speech patterns additionally a generational component built into language development ensures that english will continue to evolve each generation wants to separate themselves from the previous one mr hickey said that change is not going to stop you re not going to get teenagers who want to dress like their parents and listen to the same music as their parents and there s a linguistic aspect to that as well as english continues to spread around the world it will lead to an increasing number of new emergent varieties of world englishes it doesn t belong to england anymore mr upton said just as you in north america have done things with it and own it yourselves so people in africa and the far east and so on are doing the same it s all very exciting  belturbet ireland when he crossed into northern ireland recently patrick o reilly felt his body tense up a feeling that was once all too familiar but that he thought would never return yet now the fear and anxiety were creeping back like a long lost relative suddenly appearing out of nowhere looking for trouble mr o reilly blames britain for stirring up those grievances its expected departure possibly a messy one from the european union known as brexit is reopening old wounds and resentments in ireland against its former colonial master the british said mr o reilly a retired pub manager as he wove back and forth across the barely detectable border in his car are about to kick us in the teeth again in the tortured history between the two island nations brexit is just the latest in a long line of perceived slights the irish have suffered at the hands of the british and now with the possible exception of britain no country stands to lose more from brexit and particularly from a damaging no deal departure than ireland  dublin for decades some of ireland s church run mother and baby homes gave the bodies of many of the children who died in their care to medical schools for dissection a government inquiry reported on wednesday indicating that the scale of the abuses at the homes for single mothers was greater than previously known the mother and baby homes commission of investigation created in 2015 by the irish government revealed that in dublin alone several of the homes run by the roman catholic church had sent the bodies of 950 children almost all born to single mothers to medical schools as anatomical subjects the practice continued until 1977 some other homes also kept few if any records of what had been done with the bodies of the children who died in their care the report found   we are hoping that the women will engage with us like they do in other countries she said sometimes they are just looking for someone to tell them not to do it and show them a better way the stakeouts have spread so widely that abortion rights groups have begun calling for exclusion zones around abortion facilities dr caitriona henchion the medical director of the irish family planning association which provides legitimate abortion services said the main aim of the protests was to intimidate doctors people are really afraid i think particularly in rural parts she said at her clinic which has been at capacity since the service started at the beginning of the year doctors sending their kids to the local school don t want them to be abused or shouted at because it becomes known that their mother or father is offering abortion services the clinic has been working around the clock to ensure that women do not miss the 12 week mark that would force them to go abroad for the procedure although the services are running far more smoothly now than they were at the beginning of the month dr henchion said many women still worry about the limited options in some facilities especially at hospitals and the continuing difficulty in getting an abortion i was one of the first women to get an abortion in ireland arlene the woman who had to travel to a town 40 minutes away for the procedure said i know this is huge but my case was pretty straightforward and even then it was complicated the fact that women are still traveling shows that there are problems with the legislation she said i m sure that once everyone catches their breath from the referendum there will be protests  londonderry northern ireland gary donnelly a city councilor in londonderry has fought for years to end british rule in northern ireland after the 1998 peace agreement many of his allies put aside the struggle to expel the british and reunify with the irish republic but not mr donnelly now in the unremitting gloom that has been northern ireland s lot in recent years he has sighted a beacon of hope in britain s withdrawal from the european union or brexit as the possibility grows of britain s crashing out with no deal so too does the likelihood of the reimposition of a hard border with the irish republic that many people see as a dire threat to peace and stability but mr donnelly has a different take while he shares a sense of alarm about a hard border he also thinks talk of its return has brought much needed clarity to the irish question brexit has highlighted the absurdity of partition mr donnelly said others had always been brushing it under the carpet  this classic poundcake has a boozy twist that s perfect for parties st

building had once been a carriage house for horses women in fancy dresses and men in suits would wait for their carriages to be ready the image captured her imagination and eventually would give the

via infected needles while 53 percent were attributable to sex between men according to health officials at the same time the proportion of new cases via heterosexual transmission once a small part of the total has now risen to 33 percent dr igoe said many of these new cases involved migrants who were not aware of an infection and had come from countries with a much higher prevalence of heterosexual h i v transmission such as in sub saharan africa barriers to medicines may have also contributed to the increase andrew leavitt a spokesman for the irish chapter of the international h i v activist group act up said the use of medications to prevent infection before and after exposure so called prep drugs that are particularly effective at reducing transmission among gay and bisexual

decades had some of the most restrictive abortion laws in europe in a referendum last year voters repealed a clause in ireland s constitution that effectively outlawed abortion and legislation passed at the end of 2018 allowed for unrestricted terminations of pregnancies up to 12 weeks the legalization was immediately met by small scale protests with a demonstration at a clinic in galway gaining national attention on thursday after a handful of anti abortion activists gathered outside the entrance with signs that read real doctors don t terminate their patients and say no to abortion in

mystery of what exactly happened that night and why to also investigate the history of the troubles in ireland and write about the lives of many people involved on each side of the conflict keefe

economic shocks unlikely to occur but which would have a significant impact on the economy and financial system if they did lane said the main such risk facing ireland leaving aside brexit is its high dependence on multinational firms and that if there were a persistent shock to that sector the cumulative economic decline would dwarf a normal cyclical recession ireland is the european home for

the association s finances and corporate governance as well as calls for sweeping board changes the fai s state funding was suspended last week as the failure to disclose the deterioration in its

and northern ireland would also be bound by many rules of the single market european leaders not only demanded the backstop but they also insisted that it have no expiration date britain could therefore be outside the european union with no voice in shaping its rules but remain closely tied to the bloc indefinitely to mrs may s hard line pro brexit colleagues that is a nightmare scenario that could leave britain permanently powerless to determine its own trade destiny the prime minister could ignore the pro brexit factions in her party and cut a deal with the labour party for a soft brexit that would at minimum leave britain in the customs union but that would risk alienating those who voted in the referendum to leave and it would risk tearing the conservatives apart an outcome that many believe is mrs may s greatest fear european officials have suggested that britain could largely avoid the single market standards by having only northern ireland abide by those listed in the backstop while a different set of rules could be adopted for the rest of the country british lawmakers have rejected that out of hand because they say that it would create a virtual border in the

provision known as the irish backstop will not last forever if mr cox proclaims his satisfaction that the backstop is not meant to be perpetual and that brussels does not intend to trap britain into a customs union then maybe just maybe mrs may can secure a parliamentary majority before the withdrawal date of march 29 mrs may has promised a vote by next tuesday if mr cox says that he is not satisfied then it is likely that a divided british cabinet and parliament will vote to ask the other member states of the european union to extend the cutoff date for at least three months an extension likely to be agreed upon at a key summit meeting on march 21 22 such a delay would avoid an unregulated exit by britain with unhappy though unclear consequences for both sides  dublin

conference in brussels with the irish prime minister leo varadkar  this reciprocity between project and place extends beyond the countryside another reason the marriage between thrones and the region

pretty consistently been for the past decade it s worth noting that throughout that whole period conservative critics of the fed the same people now backing trump attacked the institution for keeping interest rates too low not too high still it s now clear that the attempt to normalize monetary policy was premature but the fed s premature rate hikes aren t why the trump tax cut is failing how do we know that because all those boasts about why the tax cut would work miracles were based on a specific story about what is holding the u s economy back and that story was and is all wrong the trumpist theory which was i m sorry to say endorsed by conservative economists who should have known better was that there was a huge pile of money sitting outside the u s that companies would bring back and invest productively if given the incentive of lower tax rates but that pile of money was an accounting fiction and the tax cut didn t give corporations an incentive to build new factories and so on all it did was induce them to shift their tax avoidance strategies as brad setser of the council on foreign relations points out a casual glance at the data seems to suggest that american companies earn a lot of their profits at their overseas subsidiaries but a closer look shows that the bulk of these reported profits are in a handful of small countries with low or zero tax rates like bermuda luxembourg and ireland the companies obviously aren t earning huge profits in these tiny economies they re just using accounting gimmicks to assign profits earned elsewhere to subsidiaries that may have a few factories but sometimes consist of little more than a small office or even just a post office box these basically phony profits then accumulate on the books of the overseas subsidiaries rather than the home company but this doesn t affect their ability to invest in america if apple wants to spend a billion dollars here it can always borrow the money using the assets of its irish subsidiary as collateral in other words u s taxes weren t having any significant effect in deterring real investment in the u s economy when trump cut the tax rate some companies brought money home but for the most part this had no economic significance here s how it works apple ireland transfers some of its assets to apple u s a officially apple ireland has reduced its investment spending while paying a dividend to u s investors in reality apple as an entity has the same total profits and the same total assets it did before it hasn t devoted a single additional dollar to purchases of equipment r d or anything else for its u s operations not surprisingly then the investment boom trump economists promised has never materialized companies didn t use their tax breaks to

museum its sole exhibit was a handwoven tapestry 263 feet in length mounted along the curves of a display wall in the style of the bayeux tapestry which related the history of the 11th century norman conquest of britain it consisted of a seamless series of panels illustrating scenes of a violent history a child pushed from a tower by a man with golden hair a hooded figure savaged by a gigantic wolf as a woman with bleeding hands looked on a knight beheading a horse with his sword a woman in a cave naked giving birth to a creature made of shadows these neatly delineated horrors went on and on becoming more and more vivid as the tapestry progressed luckily my son hadn t stuck around long enough to be subjected to these images he d taken one look at the tapestry pronounced it just a big cloth going around the room and demanded to be taken to the toilet on a lower floor by his mother the tapestry i realized was now further along in the history of the show s war of the five kings than i myself was i was midway through season 2 having lately gotten into it in the most absurd manner possible witnessing for the first time the beauty of northern ireland on those location tours i wanted to see it transformed into westeros in its recording the episodes of an imagined history the tapestry was also a gantlet of spoilers what it really was of course was a clever marketing device dreamed up by hbo and tourism ireland and made real by a group of highly skilled belfast linen weavers for every episode a new panel was added so that shortly after the series finale aired in may the game of thrones tapestry would be longer than the bayeux tapestry itself i didn t know whether i found the tapestry ingenious or horrendous or some volatile combination of both but mostly i just couldn t discount the sense that what i was looking at was in fact some form of historical artifact further evidence of the encroachment of the realm of westeros upon our own i arrived at the end of the tapestry at the point where recorded history gave way to an uncertain future and i thought again of borges of tlön of the way in which a complex and confusing reality yields to the man made order of a fictional world given the fragility of digital records compared with physical artifacts it was possible to imagine future historians misunderstanding this cross promotional tie in as a real historical document it was possible to imagine in fact that this would not be a misunderstanding at all i came to a scene of a banquet massacre lavishly rendered throats slit torsos pierced with arrows a pregnant woman daggered in the belly the terrible violence of the image was rendered appealingly neat even pretty by the skillful weaving the red of the blood gushing from the wounds pooling on the banquet hall floor reminded me of the paint splashed on the welcome to northern ireland sign at the border ahead of me a bearded man in his late 20s had been glossing each panel for the benefit of his female companion who seemed less impressed by his historical knowledge than he did himself he inclined his head now toward the woven scene of butchery that s the red wedding he said his face set in a performance of stern scholarship one of the all time great episodes the woman said nothing only nodded equably it was unclear how interested she was in any of this the world i thought was already yielding to westeros the truth is that it longed to yield  mr adams has denied the characterizations of his behavior as abusive or manipulative and challenged the accuracy of the times reporting though he apologized on twitter to anyone i have ever hurt however unintentionally mr adams has also denied he has ever engaged in sexual communications with someone he knew was underage the

may and make another effort to garner support for any other alternative jeremy corbyn leader of the opposition labour party said that the margin of defeat for one of the options tonight was very narrow indeed and the prime minister s deal has been rejected by very large majorities on three occasions if it is good enough for the prime minister to have three chances at her deal then i suggest that possibly the house should have a chance to consider again the options that we had before us today in a debate on wednesday so that the house can succeed where the prime minister has failed after monday s votes a lawmaker who tried to forge one of the compromise plans nick boles said he was resigning from the conservative party because he said it has shown itself to be incapable of compromise mr boles said he would remain in parliament as an independent if mrs may s plan does not get another vote she could try to pursue an exit without any agreement but that would split her cabinet and some members might resign also parliament has indicated that it does not support an exit without a deal  kabul afghanistan if ever a team needed to win big for its fans sake it was this one at this moment on monday afghanistan s beloved national cricket squad prompted cheers back home by winning its first ever match in the test format the sport s highest level of competition the win against ireland at a test match in northern india is an increasingly rare commodity a good news story in afghanistan security forces there are fighting a desperate bloody campaign against the taliban and many fear that if the united states reaches a deal with the insurgents it could jeopardize human rights and the safety of ethnic minority groups people are in love with cricket and amid the news of suicide attacks bombing of civilians and losses of security forces it is the only thing that brings happiness said nazim jar abdurrahimzai the game development manager at the afghanistan cricket board  it is a measure of english brexiteers political acumen that they were initially oblivious to the volatile irish question and contemptuous of the scottish one ireland was cynically partitioned to ensure that protestant settlers outnumber native catholics in one part of the country the division provoked decades of violence and consumed thousands of lives it was partly healed in 1998 when a peace agreement removed the need for security checks along the british imposed partition line the re imposition of a customs and immigration regime along britain s only land border with the european union was always likely to be resisted with violence but brexiteers awakening late to this ominous possibility have tried to deny it a leaked recording revealed mr johnson scorning concerns about the border as pure millennium bug stuff politicians and journalists in ireland are understandably aghast over the aggressive ignorance of english brexiteers businesspeople everywhere are outraged by their cavalier disregard for the economic consequences of new borders but none of this would surprise anyone who knows of the unconscionable breeziness with which the british ruling class first drew lines through asia and africa and then doomed the people living across them to endless suffering the malign incompetence of the brexiteers was precisely prefigured during britain s exit from india in 1947 most strikingly in the lack of orderly preparation for it the british government had announced that india would have independence by june 1948 in the first week of june 1947 however mountbatten suddenly proclaimed that the transfer of power would happen on aug 15 1947 a ludicrously early date as he himself blurted out in july a british lawyer named cyril radcliffe was entrusted with the task of drawing new boundaries of a country he had never previously visited given only around five weeks to invent the political geography of an india flanked by an eastern and a western wing called pakistan radcliffe failed to visit any villages communities rivers or forests along the border he planned to demarcate dividing agricultural hinterlands from port cities and abruptly reducing hindus muslims and sikhs on either side of the new border to a religious minority radcliffe delivered a plan for partition that effectively sentenced millions to death or desolation while bringing him the highest ranked knighthood up to one million people died countless women were abducted and raped and the world s largest refugee population was created during the population transfers across radcliffe s border an extensive carnage that exceeds all apocalyptic scenarios of brexit in retrospect mountbatten had even less reason than mrs may to speed up the exit clock and create insoluble and eternal problems just a few months after the botched partition for instance india and pakistan were fighting a war over the disputed territory of kashmir none of the concerned parties were pushing for a hasty british exit as the historian alex von tunzelmann points out the rush was mountbatten s and his alone  no talking patrick radden keefe got the idea for say nothing a true story of murder and memory in northern ireland which enters the nonfiction list this week at no 7 from a new york times obituary back in 2013 it was one of those obituaries that just cracks open a whole world that you had very little inkling of beforehand he explained on a recent episode of the book review podcast a woman named dolours price had died and she had been an i r a soldier she had been the first woman to join the i r a as a front line soldier leading bombing raids targeting people for execution she was a very dramatic impetuous figure keefe says he was so intrigued by some of the details in the obituary that i wanted to see where they went where they went it turns out is straight to the notorious 1972 kidnapping and murder of jean mcconville a widowed belfast mother of 10 in say nothing as keefe investigates the crime a history of northern ireland and the troubles unfurls in the background as he says i m drafting on an incredibly brave effort by her children starting in the 1990s to come out and break the code of silence in ireland and say we need to know what happened to our mother we ve been waiting decades for answers for a body and i think it took great courage for them to do that now you re talking if say nothing is ultimately about keeping silent then peter h reynolds s say something which enters the picture book list at no 7 is about the opposite about exhorting kids to be heard whether through their words or their actions if you see someone lonely say something by just being there for them maria russo the children s books editor at the times says that titles like this are part of a new trend that she calls empathy books they re not stories so much as poetic explorations of compassion and justice she explains with the adults shouting and slinking off to their corners so

many of the politicians from mrs may s camp who defied her on tuesday came to her support on wednesday opting to keep her in office rather than risk an election in which they had no acceptable

vote on her brexit plan that could go down to a humiliating defeat in parliament prime minister theresa may of britain was fighting on monday less to avert the loss than to limit its scale in that

over the path to withdrawing from the european union actually came close to agreeing on something monday a solution known as a customs union what is it simply put it would entail britain s agreeing to stay permanently in a customs union with the bloc a soft brexit of sorts what is a customs union the customs union being proposed in parliament by a former conservative chancellor ken clarke would

may had always said she wouldn t call an election to reinforce her legitimacy but by early 2017 she was riding high in the polls and saw an opportunity to boost her majority and hopefully make the brexit process smoother she triggered a snap election in june 2017 but it didn t go well may was uncomfortable with a campaign which she thought was trying to make her look presidential but did not suit her in any way the former aide said her poll lead dwindled and while the conservatives did win the most seats in parliament may lost her majority and was forced to turn to the northern irish

from the european union its biggest peacetime decision in decades the government remains in crisis and the nation continues to rush toward the departure date without a plan in place on friday british lawmakers rejected prime minister theresa may s plan for withdrawing from the european union for the third time this means that britain is moving closer to a departure date of april 12 without a deal a scenario that many fear will be economically damaging already companies are jumping ship fears of medicine shortages in a no deal departure are rising many options from the daringly complete break with no deal to abandoning brexit altogether remain on the table but parliament already has weighed several alternatives and voted all of them down the european union agreed recently to postpone the original brexit deadline march 29 saying that if mrs may could win passage of her deal by then brexit would take effect on may 22 otherwise there will be the potentially chaotic no deal brexit on april 12 unless both sides agree by then on a much longer delay to allow a more fundamental reconsideration of their divorce what ultimately emerges could determine the shape of britain and its place in the world for decades following is a basic guide to brexit what it is how it developed into the mess it is today and how it could ultimately be resolved what is brexit a portmanteau of the words britain and exit brexit is shorthand for britain s split from the european union changing its relationship to the bloc on trade security and migration britain has been debating the pros and cons of membership in a european community of nations almost from the moment the idea was broached it held its first referendum on membership in 1975 less than three years after it joined in 2013 prime minister david cameron promised a national referendum on european union membership with the idea of settling the question once and for all the options it would offer were remain and leave and mr cameron was convinced that remain would win handily on june 23 2016 as a refugee crisis made migration a subject of political rage across europe and amid accusations of lies and fraudulent tactics by the leave side britons voted for a hazily defined brexit by 52 percent to 48 percent not only did that not settle the debate but it saved for another day the tangled question of what should come next now that day may finally be arriving how did britain vote england and wales voted for brexit overcoming support to remain in the european union in london scotland and northern ireland see a detailed map of the vote why is it such a big deal europe is britain s most important export market and its biggest source of foreign investment and being in the bloc has helped london cement its position as a global financial center every day it seems a major business announces or threatens plans to leave britain after it quits the european union including airbus which employs 14 000 people and supports more than 100 000 other jobs the government expects the country s economy to grow anywhere from 4 to 9 percent less than it would inside the bloc over the next 15 years depending on how it leaves mrs may has promised that brexit will end free movement the right of people from elsewhere in europe to move to britain and vice versa that is a triumph for some working class people who see immigration as a threat to their jobs but dispiriting for young britons hoping to study or work abroad what s holding it up undoing 46 years of economic integration in one stroke was never going to be easy and the brexit process has been bedeviled by the same divisions that led to the referendum in the first place both britain s main parties the governing conservatives and the labour opposition are divided over what to do leaving parliament so factionalized that there may be no coherent plan most lawmakers would back mrs may spent 18 months negotiating a divorce deal with the european union shedding one cabinet minister after another in the process her plan would keep customs and trade arrangements with the bloc until at least the end of 2020 but ultimately envisions cutting most of those ties it does not detail what would replace them in britain s future relationship with the european union when she presented the plan to parliament in january it was rejected by a historic margin of 230 votes when she tried again in march she fared less badly but the pact was still soundly defeated 391 to 242 we keep hearing about the irish border what s that about the single greatest hangup is the question of britain s only land border with the european union the invisible line between ireland another member state of the bloc and northern ireland which remains part of the united kingdom mrs may and her irish counterpart leo varadkar want to prevent checkpoints from going up at the border such barriers are generally seen as incompatible with the good friday agreement which brought respite from decades of violence in northern ireland but the method she agreed for guaranteeing that called the backstop has alienated much of parliament the backstop would keep the whole united kingdom in a temporary trading relationship with europe until a final deal avoiding a hard border could be agreed on something that hard line brexiteers fear would never happen and it would bind northern ireland to even more european rules to the dismay of those who reject any regulatory differences between northern ireland and the rest of the united kingdom like the democratic unionist party of northern ireland whose 10 lawmakers give mrs may her parliamentary majority why is brexit in the news with the widely feared prospect of a no deal brexit coming closer mrs may made a last ditch bid this week to win support for her deal she said this week that if parliament accepted it on her third try she would step down setting off a frenzy of speculation about a successor and jockeying for position among the contenders in her conservative party at the same time parliament took an extraordinary step of its own holding a series of votes over the prime minister s objections to try to agree on another approach the effort fizzled lawmakers rejected all eight options they considered some of the steps parliament weighed lost only narrowly with many lawmakers abstaining making it unclear what would have happened if everyone had voted just about the only clear decision britain has made on brexit since the 2016 referendum was to give formal notice in 2017 to quit under article 50 of the european union s lisbon treaty a legal process setting it on a two year path to departure that set march 29 2019 as the formal divorce date now pushed back to april 12 mrs may has yet to find a way to overcome seemingly impossible parliamentary arithmetic and get lawmakers to back her agreement with european leaders the fantasy that brexit would be easy has crumbled and lawmakers who made lofty promises to their constituents are having to face hard reality what are the alternatives mrs may could tack to the center by committing to a permanent trading relationship with europe a customs union that would do away with tariffs and quotas that way she would solve the irish border dilemma and possibly win some votes from opposition labour lawmakers that would be a softer brexit than the one she negotiated with britain remaining closely tied to the european union s tariffs and product standards but that would enrage the right wing lawmakers in her party and risk splitting the conservatives which she wants to avoid at all costs so she has instead tried to win over the hard liners who want a harder brexit with fewer ties to the bloc of the options considered this week by parliament the one it came closest to endorsing was a soft brexit approach remaining in the european union s customs union it lost 272 to 264 but more than 100 lawmakers abstained so it is anyone s guess how the vote would have gone if every lawmaker had taken part jeremy corbyn the labour leader has worked hard not to commit his party to a distinct course on brexit but under pressure from many of his members he has expressed a willingness to back a second referendum under certain circumstances but a referendum could take many forms and there is no agreement on that either one of the options parliament considered this week was a popular vote to confirm or reject mrs may s deal and it lost 295 to 268 once again more than enough lawmakers abstained to sway the outcome many brexit opponents want a different referendum a rerun of the 2016 contest asking voters if they want any brexit at all polls indicate that public opinion has shifted in favor of remaining in the european union but so far parliament has not considered such a measure still other pro europe voters want parliament to kill brexit on its own or at least delay it for years by revoking article 50 exiting without a deal in place also remains a real possibility one that the hard line pro brexit forces in the conservative party insist would be preferable to a long delay what comes next mrs may s third defeat appears to leave the increasingly weakened prime minister with two unpalatable options in the short run britain can leave the bloc on april 12 without an agreement in place or she can ask european leaders for what could be a long postponement the only thing a parliamentary majority has been able to agree on is that it does not want to crash out of the european union without a deal but a long delay would enrage pro brexit lawmakers who see a further postponement as a first step toward watering down brexit or even killing it entirely no one knows how things will turn out some ardent brexiteers who would accept a no deal withdrawal have come around to supporting mrs may s deal believing that it might be their only chance to avoid a soft brexit or remaining in the bloc and others might follow the hard liners fear that if nothing is approved by the new april deadline the government would agree to a much longer extension to avoid a no deal exit which could give backers of a second referendum time to build support for what currently seems a long shot option that could end in britons reversing their decision to leave the european union altogether one thing is certain it is a mess  michael barbaro from the new york times i m michael barbaro this is the daily today after months of trying and failing to put forward a deal for how the u k could leave the european union theresa may had one final thing to offer herself it s monday april 1 automated attendant thank you for calling the london office of the new york times ellen barry hello michael barbaro oh hello how are you ellen ellen barry i m great michael barbaro i m so sorry that we ve had technical difficulties this morning ellen barry not to worry michael barbaro it wouldn t be the daily if we didn t have a little technical difficulty o k so here we go ellen tell me when you are ready ellen barry ready michael barbaro o k ellen barry is a times correspondent in london ellen barry so last wednesday in the middle of the day theresa may called her party members to committee room 14 which is a big committee room somewhere in the bowels of westminster palace it was quite unclear what this was about there was loads of speculation that she would perhaps fire her chief negotiator for brexit who is widely despised by right wingers in her party archived recording the world s cameras are trained on the british parliament waiting for a brexit breakthrough for many the workings of this house appear increasingly mystifying but after months of brexit paralysis could things be starting to move ellen barry so at five o clock conservative lawmakers began crowding into this room and it was by all accounts stifling and completely packed the minister for international development couldn t even get in there and was watching through the keyhole and it is traditional in these gatherings that when the prime minister comes in people bang on the tables with their hands it s kind of like a tribal drumbeat and so then the room went silent the door closed the room went silent and what was said in there was said only to each other but meetings like this leak like sieves and archived recording in a closed meeting with conservative m p s theresa may said she s prepared to make the ultimate move ellen barry gradually the outside world came to know that the thing that she was prepared to offer in exchange for their votes was herself archived recording she concluded by asking everyone in the room to back her deal to allow for a smooth and orderly brexit ellen barry she basically said i ll make you a deal if you vote for this if you vote for the withdrawal agreement and get it through then i will step down as prime minister michael barbaro brexit for my head ellen barry basically michael barbaro ellen how did all of this happen how did theresa may end up being at the center of brexit ellen barry so the funny thing is that brexit was never theresa may s issue she kind of kept her head down but she was a remainer she voted to stay inside the european union and really just stayed out of the whole public debate over brexit to a great extent and it was really somewhat by accident that she became prime minister archived recording david cameron is back in downing street a happy man after a surprise election victory against most predictions his party has won a slim but outright majority ellen barry it started with david cameron who was basically hoping to stop a hemorrhage of m p s from switching sides and going to ukip which was the brexit party archived recording david cameron we will give the british people a referendum with a very simple in or out choice ellen barry and he made a gamble archived recording david cameron to stay in the european union on these new terms or to come out altogether it is time for the british people to have their say it is time for us to settle this question about britain and europe ellen barry it was essentially to kind of assuage the hard right of his party he thought he could essentially throw them a bone and get them onside and he did so expecting that the country would vote to remain and it just came as a staggering surprise on june 23rd of 2016 when the results came out and it was 52 to 48 percent for leaving the european union archived recording david cameron the british people have voted to leave the european union and their will must be respected ellen barry and because david cameron had been squarely opposed to leaving the european union he then announced that he was going to step down as prime minister rather than lead the country through the process of leaving archived recording david cameron i think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction i will do everything i can as prime minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months but i do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination michael barbaro so why does theresa may end up taking his place if she had been a remainer if she d been opposed to brexit ellen barry so theresa may ended up taking his place because the men who were the obvious front runners to be his successors took each other out in the political fistfight that followed and i suppose she was appealing in a sense that she was quite different from all of those top tory men there s a phrase they use at balliol college which is the tranquil assurance of effortless superiority archived recording theresa may some people would say sometimes life as a vicar s daughter isn t it can have its ups and downs ellen barry theresa may is nothing like that i mean not on any level archived recording theresa may but i feel hugely privileged actually in the childhood that i had ellen barry she was the daughter of a small town vicar and the granddaughter of two lady s maids and the great granddaughter of a butler so she came from a family with a really long sense of public service and duty archived recording what s the naughtiest thing you ever did archived recording theresa may oh goodness me well i suppose gosh do you know i m not quite sure archived recording there must have been a moment archived recording theresa may well nobody s ever perfectly behaved are they i have to confess when me and my friends used to run through the fields of wheat the farmers weren t too pleased about that ellen barry so she seemed like one of the grown ups in the room at the time someone who could potentially bring the country back together after an incredibly difficult and divisive referendum campaign michael barbaro so the men who create brexit essentially self immolate and the party turns to theresa may ellen barry yes she cast herself as someone who was trying to do the least damage i mean instead of projecting enthusiasm about the mission of brexit she tended to express a sense of duty that she had taken on the job she was going to finish the job archived recording theresa may we are living through an important moment in our country s history following the referendum we face a time of great national change and i know because we are great britain that we will rise to the challenge ellen barry but it didn t take long for her to start making serious blunders around brexit because it turned out that she is one of the worst retail politicians that britain has ever seen archived recording theresa may i know that the public sector has had to carry a heavy burden the private sector has played its part too but with government businesses and the public sector working together we have bounced back ellen barry she is wooden she is unable to speak off script she cannot generate warmth she seems congenitally unable to generate warmth archived recording theresa may brexit means brexit and we are going to make a success of it ellen barry she went out on the stump and repeated kind of robotically archived recording theresa may brexit means brexit ellen barry a set of phrases that she had been briefed on archived recording theresa may because brexit means brexit ellen barry and she earned the nickname the maybot because she was seemingly unable to come up with different answers even when the same question was asked her repeatedly archived recording theresa may well the reason i ve been saying brexit means brexit is precisely because it does and to be very clear archived recording this is what history looks like the official letter formally starting the process of britain leaving the european union is delivered ellen barry so she made a series of very significant blunders that year one of them maybe the most important one is that she triggered article 50 archived recording theresa may the article 50 process is now underway and in accordance with the wishes of the british people the united kingdom is leaving the european union ellen barry which started the clock ticking towards an end date an exit date of march 29 archived recording theresa may this is an historic moment from which there can be no turning back britain is leaving the european union we are going to make our own decisions and our own laws ellen barry as soon as she started that the e u had an enormous advantage in the negotiations archived recording theresa may this is a decisive step which enables us to move on and finalize the deal in the days ahead these decisions were not taken lightly but i believe it is a decision that is firmly in the national interest ellen barry she also as a general matter played her cards incredibly close to her vest throughout the negotiation so the country really didn t know where she was going with this process until quite late last year when she shared her withdrawal agreement with the country archived recording theresa may when you strip away the detail the choice before us is clear this deal which delivers on the vote of the referendum which brings about control of our money laws and borders ends free movement protects jobs security and our union or leave with no deal or no brexit at all ellen barry and it went over like a lead balloon michael barbaro and why was that ellen barry well she laid out a series of red lines that were in fact very hard brexit red lines no one knew up until that point that she was planning to exit the customs union and the single market archived recording theresa may and because we will no longer be members of the single market we will not be required to contribute huge sums to the e u budget the days of britain making vast contributions to the european union every year will end michael barbaro and why is that ultimately a blunder ellen barry well they had no solution for what would turn out to be the fatal problem with that plan which is britain is not an island there is a land border between the republic of ireland and northern ireland and you cannot just walk away from the customs union without creating some kind of a border and of course that open border between northern ireland and the republic had been the subject of a 30 year armed struggle and a hard fought peace agreement so to gloss over it was not looking at the problem which was going to block this thing at the end archived recording theresa may the choices before us were difficult particularly in relation to the northern ireland backstop ellen barry but the way she squared the circle with the irish border is to create something called the backstop and what the backstop means is that the entire of the u k would remain in the customs union until such a time that there is a solution to the border problem which could easily be never and this is why she lost her brexiteers because they said well this is just a way for us to stay in the european union subject to their regulations indefinitely because there is no provision for the united kingdom leaving the backstop unilaterally so they just saw themselves as being stuck at the mercy of europe indefinitely michael barbaro wow that s the first time i understood the backstop thank you archived recording 1 the fact is that her deal isn t really a deal because what it actually does is postpone everything it doesn t settle anything it actually guarantees more uncertainty which is terrible for business and it s not even brexit archived recording 2 it is not brexit at all and they re pretending that it is ellen barry so what she begins to do is try to persuade the country to compromise but it is extremely late in the game and she hasn t laid the groundwork for a compromise much of her energy went to keeping the hardliners onside and as soon as she published her withdrawal agreement she lost them archived recording theresa may still believes there s a battle to be won in brussels a growing number of british m p s don t the view from europe is of a nation increasingly at odds with itself michael barbaro and how does may respond to all these condemnations and men who are essentially beating her up ellen barry this is such an irritating maddening group of people that i don t know a lot of britons during this period their heart went out to her because any normal person would just throw their hands up and walk away from this nightmare of a job but she d just wake up in the morning and dust herself off and set aside her personal feelings and say archived recording theresa may i believe with every fiber of my being that the course i have set out is the right one for our country and all our people ellen barry again and again archived recording theresa may from the very beginning i have known what i wanted to deliver for the british people to honor their vote in the referendum ellen barry i have committed to delivering brexit to the british people archived recording theresa may the british people just want us to get on with it they are looking to the conservative party to deliver to deliver a brexit that works for the whole u k ellen barry and that s what i m going to do archived recording theresa may i m going to do my job of getting the best deal for britain i m going to do my job of getting a deal that is in the national interest ellen barry she stuck with it and she stuck with it and she seemed unwilling to give up archived recording theresa may and am i going to see this through yes music ellen barry until last week michael barbaro we ll be right back so bring us back to this committee room number 14 what do we know about what theresa may said as she offered her own head to members of the conservative party as this final gesture ellen barry this was the way it was described by george freeman who was her former policy adviser she with tears not far from her eyes said i promised i would deliver the brexit agreement she said i ve made many mistakes i m only human i beg you colleagues vote for the withdrawal agreement and i will go he said there was silence in the room and it was incredibly sad music ellen barry after she finished speaking in this committee room there were several m p s who were hardline holdout brexiteers who got up and said publicly that they were now going to back her deal michael barbaro wow so this seems to be working ellen barry yes for the next 45 minutes to an hour journalists were on twitter just counting the number of brexiteers that were changing sides and you had people like boris johnson who i think he had compared her deal to a suicide vest at one point this is what he said to the daily telegraph i feel very very sorry and though it fills me with pain i m going to have to support this thing so he flipped sides jacob rees mogg another brexiteer bannerman tweeted out that half a loaf is better than no bread in other words he was willing to give up some of his brexiteer credibility to get behind theresa may and give her his vote and you just began to see this happening again and again they were flipping and i think it got up to something like 30 or 40 people were indicating that they were changing sides and it looked somehow that at this last moment in this last hail mary pass that she had thrown by offering her resignation she might have just gotten it over the line archived recording john bercow order order ellen barry but sometime after 3 o clock on friday march 29 archived recording john bercow the ayes to the right 286 the noes to the left 344 so the noes have it the noes have it ellen barry parliament rejected her withdrawal agreement for the third time by a vote of 344 to 286 michael barbaro so she just fell short ellen barry yeah she fell short archived recording john bercow point of order the prime minister archived recording theresa may point of order mr speaker mr speaker i think it should be a matter of profound regret to every member of this house that once again we have been unable to support leaving the european union in orderly fashion the implications of the house s decision are grave michael barbaro so this offer to give up her own prime ministership in exchange for brexit essentially parliament said to her not even that is enough ellen barry it wasn t enough archived recording good evening from westminster if the prime minister had had her way the united kingdom would be leaving the e u in one hour s time today should have been brexit day that s what theresa may had promised but instead she ellen barry and this is the absurd trap that we ve all been in that here is an impossible task that doesn t get done and doesn t get done and yet nothing changes there s no off ramp and so brexit still isn t done and theresa may s

songs she assembled for a rough narrative about the arc of a relationship woolfe i don t like speculating about what artists are feeling but i can imagine that after so many years away she was a little nervous to say the least so no i didn t think that opening set really bloomed vocally throughout the evening actually her breath wasn t ample enough to fill out long phrases her tone in the middle was a little grainy the low register cloudy but there was some big velvety sound in what i d call the upper middle range and wistful eloquence when she went soft the traditional irish songs

modern british history prime minister theresa may was told to come back with a plan b she did that monday but her plan b looked a lot like plan a setting the stage for another battle royale with rebellious british lawmakers over brexit or the process of withdrawing britain from the european union even though her plan was defeated in parliament last week by 230 votes mrs may told lawmakers on monday that she still hoped to win them over by negotiating changes to the plan that many regard as cosmetic what is brexit a simple guide to why it matters and what happens next she told lawmakers that she could not rule out the possibility of leaving the european union without any agreement even though preventing that outcome is probably the one thing that a healthy majority in parliament can

the end of october some commentators have said the government could extend the session until then rather than set out a new legislative program in the summer there is some talk around of extending

berlin and paris on tuesday to plead for more time to salvage her faltering withdrawal plans european leaders have indicated that they are willing to push back the date for britain s withdrawal from the bloc most likely until the end of the year but they are insisting that mrs may explain how she would put that time to constructive use that may be complicated for the prime minister back home her parliament is deadlocked over withdrawal the political parties are split and talks between the government and the opposition on a compromise plan are making minimal progress so ahead of a summit meeting in brussels on wednesday at which european union leaders will decide what to do mrs may embarked on some last minute diplomacy her goal was to reduce the risk of the summit ending in a no deal brexit on april 12 the current deadline which could have serious economic consequences  london a small but influential party aligned with prime minister theresa may s government suggested on friday that it still cannot support her plan for britain s departure from the european union a development that could doom her hopes of persuading parliament to pass the deal next week on the third try the democratic unionist party of northern ireland holds just 10 seats in the 650 seat house of commons but the central sticking point in the talks on a british withdrawal has been how to handle the border between northern ireland and ireland and the party s position carries disproportionate weight with others in parliament parliament has twice rejected the agreement that mrs may negotiated with the european union for britain s departure known as brexit and both times the d u p has voted against it largely because of concerns about the border issue if parliament rejects the deal again there is still the possibility of a cliff edge brexit in the short term or a much longer delay to renegotiate the agreement to leave  if there is no agreement by march 29 britain will depart the bloc without any deal that could mean a brutal economic adjustment as the terms of trade would change overnight disrupting the flow of goods to and from the continent in january the prime minister s brexit withdrawal proposals were defeated by 230 votes in the 650 seat parliament one of the greatest defeats in british history overturning that is a formidable task but if mrs may can at least limit the size of a second defeat she might be able to kick the can down the road one last time under that scenario she might seek one further concession at a summit of european union leaders on march 21 then perhaps hold a third final vote on her deal just before britain s scheduled departure offering it as the only alternative to delaying brexit lawmakers however are getting restive and are threatening to try to seize control of the process mrs may has promised that if parliament rejects her deal again on tuesday it will be offered votes on whether to leave the bloc without an agreement something that a majority of lawmakers oppose if they decide against that legislators would then be allowed another vote on whether britain should request an extension of its negotiations with brussels mrs may

decades it has been victims journalists and civil authorities who have forced abusers into the open and called them to account when church leaders failed to do so law enforcement officials in some countries have become more willing in recent years to prosecute priest perpetrators according to observers of the scandals here is how countries other than australia with varying historic and societal

ve said no to no deal but some of them said yes to no deal but no to theresa s deal but not as many that said no to no deal and no to theresa s deal but they don t actually have a deal of their own
