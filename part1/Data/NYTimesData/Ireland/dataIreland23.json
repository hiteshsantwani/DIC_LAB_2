DUBLIN â€” Ireland trimmed its gross domestic product (GDP) forecasts for 2019 and 2020 on Tuesday, citing a more challenging external environment and moderation of some domestic indicators in recent months.
The finance ministry still sees Europe's fastest growing economy expanding strongly with GDP rising 3.9 percent this year and 3.3 percent next - versus prior forecasts of 4.2 percent and 3.6 percent respectively - contributing to a higher budget surplus in both years.
But it acknowledged that the Irish economy was in an unusual position at present, "juxta-positioned between possible domestic overheating and capacity constraints on the one hand, and a slowdown in key export markets on the other."
"Moreover, the UK's forthcoming exit from the European Union casts a shadow over future prospects," the ministry said, adding that the recent six-month delay to Brexit meant an orderly exit remains the central scenario underpinning its forecasts.
