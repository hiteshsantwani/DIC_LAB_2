LONDON â€” The United States would not strike a wideranging trade deal with Britain after Brexit if a hard border was restored between Ireland and Northern Ireland, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi said on Monday.
"We made it clear to all, If there is any harm to the Good Friday accord, no (trade) treaty," Pelosi said during a London School of Economics event.
"I have to say though every single person, including Theresa May who we spoke to on the phone, everyone said don't even worry about that, it is unthinkable that we would even go there."
