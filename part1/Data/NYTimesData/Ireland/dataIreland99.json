DINARD, France â€” International human rights lawyer Amal Clooney will help lead a British-Canadian push to defend journalists from attacks and restrictions around the world, ministers said on Friday.
She was named co-chair of a legal panel that will draw up proposals to counter laws that hinder reporters.
"Those with a pen in their hand should not feel a noose around their neck," the British-Lebanese barrister told an event on the issue at a G7 meeting of foreign ministers in France.
More than 60 journalists were killed in 2018 according to Reporters Without Borders, more than half of them targeted deliberately, with the murder of Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi in particular drawing international condemnation.
