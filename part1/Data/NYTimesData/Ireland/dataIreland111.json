The cheers were still reverberating around Augusta National after Tiger Woods’s triumph in the Masters on Sunday, but fans were already starting to look ahead. Is Woods back after a decade of injury and personal adversity? Could he, at age 43, regain the form that had him destroying fields from 1997 to 2008? Or was the comeback a kind of fool’s gold, a last hurrah before the decline sets in again?
One thing’s for sure: People will be watching. Here’s what’s next for Woods.
P.G.A. Championship, May 16-19
The wait for the second major is shorter than usual this year because the P.G.A. has been moved from its regular August date. One goal was to get the least-heralded major a little more attention. Woods’s win in the Masters has helped that cause hugely.
Woods has won four P.G.A.s, most recently in 2007. The tournament this year will be played at Bethpage Black on Long Island. The difficult Black course has never hosted the P.G.A. before, but it was the site of the U.S. Open in 2009, when Woods tied for sixth, and in 2002, when Woods won, beating Phil Mickelson by three shots.
Woods is currently listed as one of three favorites at 10-1, along with Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy.
