DUBLIN â€” Ulster and Ireland captain Rory Best announced on Thursday his retirement from professional rugby after this year's World Cup in Japan.
"It is with mixed feelings that I announce my retirement from Ulster Rugby as of the end of this season," the 36-year-old hooker, who had previously flagged up his likely international retirement, said in a statement.
"This feels like the right time for me to go out on my terms, a luxury for which I feel very privileged."
Best, whose contract expires after the September-November World Cup, has spent 15 seasons at the top level and helped Ireland win the Six Nations four times including two Grand Slam triumphs.
