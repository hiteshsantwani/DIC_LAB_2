PHONE HOME Once I get home, I start making a bowl of porridge — oatmeal, walnuts, raisins and milk — and put the kettle on for tea. I’m the middle of seven children, and I call my sisters Carmel, Mary and Joan back home in Drogheda. Sometimes Tom joins me for breakfast. This is also the time when I catch up on world news and read poetry by Pádraig Ó Tuama.
GUESS WHO’S COMING TO BRUNCH? By 9:20 or so, I’m out the door meeting friends, and by 10:30 I sometimes call Tom to tell him I’m bringing people home for brunch. We’ve been married for 16 years — he’s gotten used to my doing this at the last minute. Tom always makes various pancakes and bacon and eggs. If he’s out of town, I do the cooking, which means we either have porridge and tea or go to Zorbas, the Greek restaurant around the corner.
CHORES Once our friends leave around 1, Tom and I do chores. Tom does the food shopping, and he bakes the communion bread for Dignity NY’s evening church service. This is the L.G.B.T. Catholic group where we met in 1996. We pitch in to do laundry and house cleaning.
