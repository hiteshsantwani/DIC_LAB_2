Irish whiskey is in revival mode. Once the world’s largest whiskey producer, Ireland nearly lost its industry in the mid-20th century because of wars and Prohibition. Now it’s back on the rise. This colorful new book provides a tour of today’s distilleries, some with venerable roots, but most starting quite recently to meet the newly skyrocketing demand. The book is organized geographically and includes pubs and shops across Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as a cocktail guide with 1 2 recipes.
“From Barley to Blarney: A Whiskey Lover’s Guide to Ireland” by Sean Muldoon, Jack McGarry, Tim Herlihy and Conor Kelly (Andrews McMeel, $28).
