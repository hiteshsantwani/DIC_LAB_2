DUBLIN — Ireland's state-funded sport coordination body suspended future funding to the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) on Tuesday after the football body acknowledged that it failed to comply with its grant approval terms.
Sport Ireland, which has been demanding answers from the FAI over a 100,000 euro (£86,451) short-term loan provided to it by former chief executive John Delaney, said the acknowledgement was made in a written statement the FAI was due to deliver to a parliamentary committee on Wednesday.
Delaney, who was moved to a new role of executive vice-president at the FAI shortly after details of the loan were first reported, is due to appear before the committee with other officials on Wednesday to answer questions over a story that has made frontpage news in Ireland in the last month.
In the FAI's statement to the committee, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, chairman Donal Conway said circumstances arose in April 2017 -- when it received the loan -- that were not related to Sport Ireland in line with grant approval conditions.
