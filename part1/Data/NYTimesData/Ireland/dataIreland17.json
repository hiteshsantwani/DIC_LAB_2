This new whiskey — from a distillery in Central Ireland that’s said to be the oldest one continually operating — is a rarity. A century or more ago, rye was used in the mash for Irish whiskey, but it went out of fashion. Kilbeggan, founded in 1757, is now making a copper-still blend with 30 percent rye for a nicely textured dram that’s warm and spicy-sweet, with hints of ginger and citrus.
