DUBLIN â€” Former Football Association of Ireland (FAI) boss John Delaney offered on Monday to leave the governing body completely, the FAI said, amid criticism from fans, players and politicians over the association's corporate governance practices.
Delaney, who was moved to a newly-created role of executive vice-president just 24 days ago after it was first reported he provided the FAI with a 100,000 euro ($113,010) loan in 2017, faced criticism, including from Ireland's prime minister, for refusing to answer questions about the funds in front of a parliamentary committee.
The short-term loan, which the FAI said it needed to relieve cash-flow issues in 2017 and avoid breaking its 1.5 million euro overdraft limit, has been a major news story in Ireland and led to investigations into the association's finances and corporate governance, as well as calls for sweeping board changes.
The FAI's state funding was suspended last week as the failure to disclose the deterioration in its finance at the time contravened grant approval rules.
