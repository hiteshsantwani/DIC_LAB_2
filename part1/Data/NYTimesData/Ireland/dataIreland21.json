Ireland this week began offering legalized abortion services, a historic shift in a country that for decades had some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe.
In a referendum last year, voters repealed a clause in Ireland’s Constitution that effectively outlawed abortion, and legislation passed at the end of 2018 allowed for unrestricted terminations of pregnancies up to 12 weeks.
The legalization was immediately met by small-scale protests, with a demonstration at a clinic in Galway gaining national attention on Thursday after a handful of anti-abortion activists gathered outside the entrance with signs that read, “Real doctors don’t terminate their patients,” and “Say no to abortion in Galway.”
The protests set off calls for additional legislation to protect those seeking abortions and for the physicians providing them, including establishing exclusion zones that would restrict how close protesters could be to places providing abortions.
