Corned beef and cabbage is classic St. Patrick’s Day fare for Irish-Americans. The meat is really just brisket that’s been cured in salt and spices, then braised until tender. It’s too late to “corn” your own for the holiday (it requires about five days’ brining). So pick up a brined, uncooked corned beef, and cook it in an Instant Pot, a slow cooker or in the oven. Leftover corned beef is great in a Reuben, Irish tacos or in red-flannel hash.
