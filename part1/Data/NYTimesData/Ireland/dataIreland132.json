The Moon will be on 15th Street, and the Earth will be on 16th Street, starting on Jan. 24, in a new public installation created by the artist Oliver Jeffers in partnership with the High Line.
The two large globes will be displayed on the Chelsea Market Passage of the High Line, separated by roughly the length of a city block, through Feb. 7. The Moon will be two feet in diameter and Earth will be about eight feet; both will be mounted at a height of 10 feet. (They are made from Hard-coated foam, steel and acrylic.) The installation, called “The Moon, the Earth and Us,” will explore the vastness of the universe, the fragility of artificial borders, and the relationship between the two celestial bodies.
“We are excited to bring the creative world of Oliver Jeffers to New York City,” Robert Hammond, co-founder and executive director of Friends of the High Line, said in an email. “His books and illustrations are beautiful and connect with a broad range of audiences — just like the High Line. And there is no better place in the city than the High Line to view the sky. With this installation Jeffers is providing our visitors and neighbors with a unique chance to see a scaled model of the Moon and the Earth up close.”
Mr. Jeffers is an artist, illustrator and author, and the cosmos has featured prominently in his work. He also has a show of oil paintings opening Jan. 10 at Bryce Wolkowitz gallery that deals more abstractly with the connections between Earth and the universe.
