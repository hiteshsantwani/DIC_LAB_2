The message this spring: Get rid of the happy feet, stay in the pocket, go through the reads and take a chance on the throws he dared not to attempt in 2018. Including the deep ones.
"I expected a lot from Ian this spring," said Long, now in his third year as coordinator. "I told him, 'Hey, challenge it. Challenge the offense. Test your arm.' Ian has been challenging himself with all of his throws. There hasn't been a fear to turn it loose. You've got to push yourself to do that if you want to be considered an elite quarterback."
Book took up Long's gauntlet, on the field and in the locker room.
"I wanted to challenge myself more, but I didn't want to create bad habits or force throws that are not possible," Book said. "I wanted to be more of a vocal leader, something I've been working on a ton. Another was challenging myself on the tighter (pass-catch) windows. The third was going through my full-read progression — the second and third reads are where the tight windows are — and trusting the guys to be in the right spot, trusting the offensive linemen, and staying in the pocket and delivering the football."
Kelly and Long said they like what they've seen in more than a dozen practices ahead of Saturday's 90th Blue-Gold game.
"Vertically, (Book's) throwing the football down the field with accuracy, confidence, movement in the pocket," Kelly said after Book hit junior receiver Michael Young for a touchdown pass on a fourth-and-10 play to end a recent practice. "(He has) ball placement on back-shoulder throws (and there's) a little more air for our guys to adjust to the football. What we can see has been a nice step up for him."
