DUBLIN — The entire board of Irish soccer's governing body has decided to step down by July in the wake of a furore over an undisclosed 100,000 euro (£86,371) loan, Transport Minister Shane Ross said on Tuesday.
The Football Association of Ireland (FAI) acknowledged last week it had broken state funding rules by failing to tell authorities about the short-term loan made by its former chief executive, John Delaney, in 2017.
In a filing to Ireland's Companies Registration Office published on Tuesday, the FAI's auditors Deloitte also said the 98-year old association's accounts were not being properly kept, contravening two sections of Irish company law.
"It is clearly time for a regime change," Ross said as he announced details of the planned mass resignation. The Association had set out the plans in a letter to the government, he added.
