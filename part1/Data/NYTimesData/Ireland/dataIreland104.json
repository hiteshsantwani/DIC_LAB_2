(Reuters) - Jofra Archer did not find a place in England's preliminary World Cup squad but the uncapped all-rounder is determined to impress in the one-day series against Pakistan and break into the final team in case there is an injury in the 15-man side.
Archer was omitted from the preliminary World Cup squad on Wednesday but got his maiden England call-up for the warm-up games against Pakistan and Ireland next month. Injury replacements for the showpiece event can be named until May 23.
Barbados-born Archer, who is eligible for national selection under new England and Wales Cricket Board residency rules, said he was surprised by his quick elevation.
"I thought I would have to wait a couple more years before I would be in contention for the full squad, I thought I would have to play for (England) Lions," the all-rounder, currently playing for Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League, told reporters.
