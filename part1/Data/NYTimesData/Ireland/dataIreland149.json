(Reuters) - West Indies have brought on board former top order batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan to help prepare their players for the 50-over World Cup in England and Wales.
Sarwan, who scored nearly 12,000 international runs across formats, joined the camp in Barbados where West Indies are currently preparing for the tri-nation series with Bangladesh and Ireland in Dublin next month.
"I've come here to act as kind of a mentor to the players and try my best to assist them in any technical ways and with any shortcomings where I think they can improve," Sarwan said in a Cricket West Indies statement.
"Our batsmen have struggled... with rotating the strike, so I'm trying to see how best we can get them to improve in this area. It's not an overnight fix, but it's important to share ideas with them, so they have something to build on."
