His steely stomach is our gain. In “Birds of North America,” debuting Sunday, March 17, on Topic.com, Ward — an educator for Zoo Atlanta and writer for the National Audubon Society — turns birding into an exceedingly charming team sport. First stop: Central Park, perhaps the best place to spot such migrating birds as Blackburnian Warblers, Rose-breasted Grosbeaks and Baltimore Orioles in North America.
It’s all so mellow — until you hear about how a rare Kirtland’s Warbler showed up last May and people lost their minds, prompting police to break up the resulting horde. In 13 five-minute episodes, Ward wanders through nature with the Feminist Bird Club, the comedian Wyatt Cenac and Jeffrey Ward, his brother, a guide with New York City Audubon and Jason’s toughest competitor: In 2018 they raced to see who could spot more bird species. (Jason won with 279; Jeffrey saw 239.)
And while birding can be high-energy, it’s the quieter moments that Jason Ward finds the most sublime. “Sometimes,” he says, “I have to remind myself: Stop. Slow down. Just let it all come around you.” KATHRYN SHATTUCK
