Ms. Jacobs, now 71, and Mr. Pringle, 80, had each lived a similar nightmare — she in the United States and he in Ireland — both caught in the slow wheels of their nations’s criminal justice systems. They were both dragged onto death row, where they spent a decade and a half awaiting execution, before their convictions were overturned for the murders that they steadfastly maintained they did not commit.
“It was an extremely dark time in our lives,” Mr. Pringle said.
On Jan. 29, Ms. Jacobs and Mr. Pringle will be at the United Nations headquarters to attend a screening of “Fallout,” a documentary that will shine an investigative light on those dark times.
Mark McLoughlin, who directed and produced the film, which follows the lives of Ms. Jacobs, Mr. Pringle and two others in the difficult aftermath of their exonerations, said he was “concerned by the fact that a victim of the state becomes classified as an enemy of the state as they fight to establish their innocence.”
“I was specifically interested in the trajectory of their lives after prison,” Mr. McLoughlin said, “which in most longer term cases have been destroyed.”
To avoid such plight, Ms. Jacobs and Mr. Pringle — who were married in November 2011 in New York and were the subjects of a Vows feature — have created the Sunny Center Foundation, which is based at their home in Ireland and at a donated property in Tampa, Fla. They welcome men and women who have been wrongfully incarcerated, providing them with spiritual, emotional and physical support to ease them back into society.
