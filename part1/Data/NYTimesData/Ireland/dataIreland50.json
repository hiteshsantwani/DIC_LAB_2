Even when she’s sitting still — which admittedly is a rare occurrence — Alison is a gale-force presence. Portrayed by the never disappointing Marin Ireland in Abby Rosebrock’s “Blue Ridge,” the emotionally congested play that opened Monday night at the Linda Gross Theater, this disgraced high-school English teacher is one of those unsettling people who suck up all the oxygen in a room in one convulsive gulp.
You could call her a life force or, as one of her sometime friends does, “a terrorist.” Alison, after all, has wound up in a North Carolina Christian halfway house, the setting for this Atlantic Theater Company production, because she took an ax to the car of her married lover, who was also the principal of the school where she worked.
Cue Carrie Underwood, whose pop hit “Before He Cheats” describes a similar act of vengeance and is cited in the opening scene of “Blue Ridge,” directed by Taibi Magar. It is one of two songs Alison uses to define herself in her first mandatory group meeting.
The second is also by Ms. Underwood, “Jesus, Take the Wheel,” which is about giving yourself over to divine guidance, or as Alison sees it, letting go and chilling out “when you’re gonna look crazy and lose all your friends.” This is not a message she seems to have taken to heart.
