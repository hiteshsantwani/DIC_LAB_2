Created with the pianist and composer Conrad Tao, “More Forever” now returns to the Guggenheim for its official premiere. With his free-spirited warmth and impeccable rhythm, Teicher first garnered attention as a dancer with the celebrated tap artist Michelle Dorrance. In works for his own ensemble, Caleb Teicher & Co., he shares her knack for percussive invention and moving bodies through space in eye-catching ways. To Tao’s score for piano and electronics, “More Forever” experiments with sources of sound, exploring American dance traditions like tap, jazz and Lindy Hop on a sand-covered stage. SIOBHAN BURKE
Classical: Experimental Opera at the Prototype Festival
Jan. 6-12; prototypefestival.org.
The Prototype Festival, held each January, is a proving ground for audacious new opera and music theater. Overseen by Beth Morrison Projects and the theater collective Here, the 12 works put on by Prototype this week unfold across New York and explore themes as varied as clinical depression, family ties, capital punishment and the legacy of Pancho Villa.
Among such intense offerings, one highlight is “prism,” composed by Ellen Reid, with a libretto by Roxie Perkins and direction by James Darrah. Staged at La MaMa in Manhattan, “prism” is Reid’s first opera, but her well-wrought music has been engaging with smart dramatic ideas for some time: She wrote a few of the most compelling scenes in “Hopscotch,” the car-based experimental opera that sprawled across Los Angeles in 2015. When “prism,” a harrowing examination of the aftermath of sexual assault, debuted last November, The Los Angeles Times declared that “Reid, in a word, has arrived.” WILLIAM ROBIN
