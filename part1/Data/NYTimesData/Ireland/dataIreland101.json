BERLIN â€” A German government spokesman dismissed as "without any foundation" reports that Chancellor Angela Merkel was prepared to limit to five years the so-called backstop that would prevent a hard border in Ireland after Brexit.
Earlier, sterling had risen on the reports, attributed by a BBC reporter to a British lawmaker.
"The reports are without any foundation," the German government spokesman said in an e-mailed statement on Tuesday. "The withdrawal agreement stands."
