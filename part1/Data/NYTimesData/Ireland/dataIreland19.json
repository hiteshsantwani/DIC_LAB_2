The Old Carriage Inn was an exercise in nostalgia from the moment it opened on Seventh Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn, in 1983.
Joan Beasley, who opened the restaurant with her then-husband, Ron , had grown up down the street. When she was little, an older neighbor described how the building had once been a carriage house for horses. Women in fancy dresses and men in suits would wait for their carriages to be ready. The image captured her imagination and eventually would give the restaurant its name.
The restaurant became a bar in the early 1990s, and in recent years it was a celebrated local dive, with a rowdy karaoke night and a close-knit circle of regulars. The customers stuck together, hanging onto memories of a grittier Park Slope even as the area become increasingly upscale.
