TAMPA, Fla. â€” It's been a somewhat difficult road back to the title game for Muffet McGraw and Notre Dame.
The Fighting Irish, who face Baylor on Sunday night for the NCAA title, came into the season as the favorites to repeat as champions, with nearly everyone back from last season's team. McGraw admitted that with the lofty expectations, the Irish weren't handling the pressure well early in the year and, most importantly, weren't having any fun.
"We came into the season with all that on us, No. 1, defending champs," she said. "Sometimes defending champs aren't really because they don't have their team back. But we did. We truly were the defending champs. It was a burden."
That changed after a meeting right before Christmas.
"We all felt like it was way too businesslike. We weren't enjoying it enough," McGraw said. "I think from then on we started to enjoy it more, they started to enjoy it a lot more. I still couldn't. It's not a celebration when you're supposed to win, and you win by 20. Then you're like, 'We didn't play well enough.' Then you start getting really picky. That was my problem most of the year."
