PARIS, France â€” The two remaining candidates in Ukraine's presidential race will meet French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday as Paris seeks to prepare for what happens after the run-off on April 21, a French presidential source said on Wednesday.
President Petro Poroshenko is facing Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a comedian with no political experience who plays a fictional president in a TV series, in the second-round vote after neither obtained a majority of votes on March 31.
France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine take part in the "Normandy" format talks, established to implement a peace agreement for eastern Ukraine brokered in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
"These contacts will allow us to calmly prepare the next steps in the development of Franco-Ukrainian ties and joint work for security on the European continent," the source said.
