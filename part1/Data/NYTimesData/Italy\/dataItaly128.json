This year marks the quincentennial of the death of Leonardo da Vinci, the Italian Renaissance master who died in May 1519. To celebrate the prodigious polymath’s life and work, museums are hosting special exhibitions and tour operators are taking travelers on Leonardo-inspired journeys across Western Europe.
In the United Kingdom, the Royal Collection Trust opened a nationwide exhibition of drawings, “Leonardo da Vinci: A Life in Drawing,” earlier this month. Museums and galleries in 12 cities, from Belfast to Southampton, are each displaying 12 of Leonardo’s drawings through May 6. Then the entire collection will be shown, along with more than 50 additional drawings, at The Queen’s Gallery, in Buckingham Palace, until Oct. 13; this assemblage will form the largest exhibition of Leonardo’s work in more than 65 years. The exhibit’s last leg, from Nov. 22 until March 15, will showcase 80 drawings at the Queen’s Gallery, Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, Scotland. The collection, curated to highlight the artist’s varied interests from engineering to botany, “allows us to enter one of the greatest minds in history,” said Martin Clayton, Head of Prints and Drawings for Royal Collection Trust.
Italy will celebrate its native son with honorary exhibits across the country, and one of the most comprehensive will be “Leonardo da Vinci: Drawing the Future,” running from April 15 to July 14, at the Royal Museums of Turin. More than 50 drawings will be on display, including “Codex on the Flight of Birds” and “Face of a Young Girl.” Leonardo’s famous “Self Portrait” will also be on view.
During a similar time period (April 19 — July 14), the Gallerie dell’Accademia in Venice will exhibit 25 drawings, including the rarely displayed masterwork “Vitruvian Man,” while the Sforza Castle in Milan is set to debut the newly restored Sala delle Asse room and show more of Leonardo’s work on May 2, the anniversary of his death.
