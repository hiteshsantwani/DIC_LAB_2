Carlo Levi’s memoir, “Christ Stopped at Eboli,” was a literary sensation in post-Fascist Italy. First published in 1945, the book is Levi’s memorable account of life among impoverished Italian villagers in the 1930s. Three decades later, an immersive and engaging film adaptation directed by Francesco Rosi enshrined the book’s underlying neorealist credo — giving voice to the voiceless.
Originally made for Italian television as a 220-minute mini-series, Rosi’s “Christ Stopped at Eboli” was shown in the United States in 1980 at approximately half its length and under the title “Eboli.” Considering the significance of the book and the stature of the director, the American theatrical premiere of the full version, now at Film Forum, is an event.
Levi, a painter, doctor and man of letters in his native Turin, was forced into exile in the southern hinterlands as a punishment for his anti-Fascist activities. In the mid-1930s, as Italy prepared to invade Ethiopia, he was sent to a small town he calls Gagliano; his account of his yearlong stay there was written years later, in Florence, while he was hiding from the Gestapo. The book’s title comes from a local saying about Gagliano’s isolation: Eboli is the last station on the train from the north; not even Christ cared to venture this far south.
“Christ Stopped at Eboli” was published the year World War II ended. At the same time, Roberto Rossellini’s “Rome, Open City” heralded a new naturalistic Italian cinema, and like that movie, Levi’s memoir was an international success. A front-page essay in The New York Times Book Review described it as sui generis, by turns “a diary, an album of sketches, a novelette, a sociological study and a political essay.” Rosi gives “Eboli” a more straightforward narrative, juxtaposing everyday fascism with Gagliano’s archaic ways, a populist historical pageant where modernity meets the medieval ages.
