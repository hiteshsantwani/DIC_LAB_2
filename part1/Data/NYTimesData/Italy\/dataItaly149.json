LONDON — Royal Dutch Shell, which is on trial in Italy over alleged corruption stemming from a $1.3 billion oil deal in Nigeria, now appears likely to face legal proceedings over the same issue in its home country, the Netherlands.
Shell said on Friday that the Dutch Public Prosecutor’s Office had warned that it was preparing to prosecute the giant oil company “for criminal charges directly or indirectly related” to a Nigerian oil deal that occurred in 2011.
A spokeswoman for the Dutch prosecutor’s office, Valentine Hoen, said that based on the investigation so far “we concluded there are prosecutable offenses.” However, she said, inquires were continuing, and no decision had been made on what if any actions would follow.
A trial in the Netherlands would mark a significant expansion of the corruption case, and risk damaging Shell’s reputation as a major player in the global oil business. The legal woes might also further complicate Shell’s operations in Nigeria, where for years it has been a major producer of oil and gas.
