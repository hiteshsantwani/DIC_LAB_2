MILAN â€” Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Friday there were investors ready to get involved in a rescue plan for troubled flagship carrier Alitalia.
"Partners are there", Di Maio said on the sideline of an event in Milan.
A deadline for Ferrovie dello Stato to present a rescue plan for Alitalia has been extended by one month to end-April after the Italian railway group, which is in talks with Delta Air Lines over Alitalia, failed to present a business plan for the carrier in time.
