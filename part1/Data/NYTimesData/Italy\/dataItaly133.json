Ever since the Italian entrepreneur Oscar Farinetti opened the first Eataly in Torino 12 years ago, he’s dreamed of bringing his Italian marketplace to Paris. But he would have to perfect the concept in 37 other locations, from Tokyo to Las Vegas, before this dream would become a reality.
“The French consumer is mature and fanatical about food,” said Mr. Farinetti, 64, last month at Eataly Paris Marais, which is to open to the public in mid-April . “They understand artisanal products, they know wine, and they’re incredibly curious. You can’t make any mistakes.”
With seven restaurants and cafes, a produce market and a cellar with more than 1,200 bottles of Italian wines, one of the most robust selections in France, Eataly Paris will take on the characteristics of its successful predecessors — a behemoth of a food hall dedicated to artisanal Italian products, ingredients and dining. Partnering with the Galeries Lafayette retail group, Mr. Farinetti is convinced he and his three sons, who run the business with him, have the right offerings to appeal to local tastes.
What can visitors expect from the Paris shop?
I like to say that Eataly is like one big family with 39 children: same father, different character. In this case, we honor France’s spirit of fraternity, its bistro culture and its close ties to Italy. We’re cousins! Half of our staff will be Italian, half will be French (in other destinations, 90 percent of the staff is local, not Italian). And we’ll have great Italian wines but 10 percent of the cellar will be devoted to French wines too — that’s very important.
