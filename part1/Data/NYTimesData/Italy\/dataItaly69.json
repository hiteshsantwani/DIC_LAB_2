MILAN â€” Economy Minister Giovanni Tria expects Italy's growth to pick up in the second half of 2019 as government measures to revive a virtually stagnant economy take effect.
Italian gross domestic product fell 0.1 percent in the third and fourth quarters of last year, putting the euro zone's third largest economy into a technical recession of two straight quarters of declining GDP.
But an unexpected rise in industrial output in February suggested Italy may already have exited the shallow recession it fell into, economists said. [nL8N21S4MZ]
Tria said on Sunday in an interview with state TV Rai that measures Rome is taking to support the economy would hopefully have a "positive although limited" impact on GDP growth rate, which the government last week cut to an estimated 0.2 percent for 2019. [nL8N21R65V]
