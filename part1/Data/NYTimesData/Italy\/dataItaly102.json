Some of the world’s top biathletes descended this weekend on Utah for the first time in 17 years. The return for a World Cup event comes as Salt Lake City promotes its bid to host the 2030 Olympics.
For Armin Auchentaller, the Italian national who began overseeing the United States women’s team last spring, the needs are more immediate. Biathlon, which combines Nordic skiing and target shooting, is the only Winter Olympic sport in which Team USA has never won a medal.
Auchentaller’s job is to change that. In a recent phone interview from Utah, where the team was preparing for competitions at Soldier Hollow, Auchentaller cited his experience coaching the Swiss biathlon team, which, like the United States, is not considered at the pinnacle of the sport. He said it had helped him understand how to take a team from nowhere to a place where where landing on an Olympic podium is possible, as the Swiss did in 2014.
Here are edited excerpts from the interview with Auchentaller.
You want to put an American on an Olympic podium. Were you an Olympian?
