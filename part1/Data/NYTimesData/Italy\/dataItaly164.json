(Reuters) - Italy's Alberto Bettiol caught the favorites off guard to win the Tour of Flanders 'Monument' classic and his maiden professional victory on Sunday.
The EF Education First rider attacked on the penultimate cobbled hill of the 270-km, one-day race and never looked back as a reduced chasing pack were left fighting over second place.
Denmark's Kasper Asgreen finished second for the Deceuninck-Quick Step team, whose best hope, favorite Zdenek Stybar, cracked with 27 kms left.
Norway's Alexander Kristoff took third place.
After showing good form in the GP E3 earlier this month, Bettiol, 25, became the first Italian to win the 'Ronde' since Alessandro Ballan in 2007.
