MILAN â€” Italy's biggest lender UniCredit said it is among a group of banks accused of running a cartel in trading euro zone government bonds between 2007 and 2012, years when financial crises dragged down banks and several European countries.
UniCredit made the disclosure on Wednesday night at the request of Italy's market watchdog, more than two months after the European Commission revealed that some traders at eight unnamed banks had exchanged commercially sensitive information and coordinated trading strategies in euro-denominated bonds.
UniCredit said the commission suspected some of its subsidiaries had violated anti-trust rules and that it might be hit by a cash fine, though it deemed this unlikely. EU rules allow for a fine of up to 10 percent of global turnover.
The bank's shares were up 0.44 percent by 1217 GMT, having earlier fallen around 2 percent in morning trade.
