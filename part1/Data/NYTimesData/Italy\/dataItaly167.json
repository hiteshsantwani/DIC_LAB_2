AUGUSTA, Ga. â€” Francesco Molinari delivered his best 18 holes at Augusta National with a six-under 66 that lifted him two strokes clear of the pack on Saturday but the Italian knows danger lurks around every corner at the Masters.
The British Open champion, who rarely looked like dropping a shot all day, had to survive a nervy finish when he hit a poor drive then landed his second in the bunker at the 18th.
However, he splashed out gently from the sand to leave himself with an easy par putt to cap another bogey-free round.
"Played the back nine probably as good as I've ever played over here, so really pleased about that. And then obviously a good save on 18," said Molinari, whose only bogey at the tournament came in the first round.
