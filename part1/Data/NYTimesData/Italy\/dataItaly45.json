ROME â€” Italy's economy showed encouraging developments in the first two months of this year, Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said on Wednesday.
He said the government's forecast for economic growth of 0.2 percent this year reflected expectations for a slight recovery in the first half, followed by a stronger pick-up.
Gross domestic product fell 0.1 percent in the third and fourth quarters of last year, putting the euro zone's third largest economy into a technical recession.
Speaking at a parliamentary hearing, Tria reiterated the 2020 budget would include a reform aimed at cutting income tax in compliance with the targets of the "DEF" economic and financial document which the government approved last week.
