ROME â€” An Italian man held hostage in Syria since April 2016 has been freed and is returning home, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Friday.
Sergio Zanotti, a businessman from Brescia, was seized in southern Turkey near the Syrian border three years ago, his family said.
Very little news was ever released about his abduction, with the government in Rome eager to maintain radio silence as they sought to gain his release.
"At the end of a complex and delicate intelligence, investigative and diplomatic operation ... we have today managed to obtain the release of Sergio Zanotti," Conte's office said in a statement.
