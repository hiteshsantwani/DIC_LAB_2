The documentary “Ferrante Fever” is, as its title suggests, less about Elena Ferrante — the enigmatic, pseudonymous Italian writer whose Neapolitan novels have enthralled readers around the world — and more about the author as a literary phenomenon. It’s an anodyne fan flick that casts only furtive glances in Ferrante’s direction, as if the filmmaker, Giacomo Durzi, were a reverential subject who doesn’t dare to make eye contact with the queen.
His approach is worshipful, decorous and therefore strikingly incongruous with the layered, ambivalent genius that his film pays tribute to — a novelist who has made a point to excavate the darker recesses of a woman’s experience. Ever mindful of what Ferrante has called her deliberate “absence,” Durzi has opted to have writers, editors and other cultural figures explain what it is they find so beguiling about her books.
