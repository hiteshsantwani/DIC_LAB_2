FRANKFURT â€” Euro zone banks expect to ease standards for business loans and consumer credit as competition remains fierce and demand slows in Italy and Spain, a European Central Bank survey showed on Tuesday.
With economic growth slowing and recession fears rising, ECB policymakers recently approved a new set of ultra-cheap loans to commercial banks, fearing they would halt the flow of credit, exacerbating the downturn.
But the results of the survey suggest that banks are not planning to make it any harder for businesses to get loans, blaming high competitive pressure.
"For the second quarter of 2019, banks expect an easing of credit standards for loans to enterprises and consumer credit, and a further tightening of credit standards for housing loans," the ECB said.
