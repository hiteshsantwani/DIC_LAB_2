ROME — Inter Milan coach Luciano Spalletti said he had agreed with club directors that his future depended on ending the season with “no regrets”.
Reports in the Italian media have suggested that Spalletti will leave at the end of the campaign, with Gazzetta dello Sport writing on Tuesday that former Chelsea manager Antonio Conte had been lined up as a replacement.
Spalletti was asked about the speculation at a news conference ahead of his team’s Serie A fixture against Frosinone on Sunday.
“I already met with the club and we decided we must not have regrets about this final part of the season,” he said.
