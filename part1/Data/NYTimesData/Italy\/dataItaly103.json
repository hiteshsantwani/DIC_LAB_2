There’s a wonderful wildness to “Daughter of Mine,” an electricity that feels untamable. It’s in the wind that blasts across the scrubby Sardinian landscape, demanding purpose from characters who seem always in danger of being buffeted off course. And it radiates from Angelica (a magnificent Alba Rohrwacher), the village floozy who services local men in exchange for free drinks. Frequently drunk and always disheveled, Angelica lives in virtual squalor, a mangy menagerie in her yard and an eviction notice on her kitchen table.
Watching over her is Tina (Valeria Golino), God-fearing and rigidly respectable, who cleans and provides as part of a secret bargain made years earlier. At the heart of that arrangement is Tina’s watchful daughter, Vittoria (Sara Casu), almost 10 and already suspicious of her tangled parentage. Drawn back to Angelica again and again, to her bright earrings and devil-may-care ways, Vittoria responds to a pull of nature that seems to obliterate the comforts of nurture. And if the choice between safety and danger, virtue and vice is at times made overwhelmingly literal, it’s also in keeping with the movie’s atavistic tone and unblinking focus on the act of mothering.
