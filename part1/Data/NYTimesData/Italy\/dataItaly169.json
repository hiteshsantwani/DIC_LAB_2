Although he oversees the design of Bulgari’s watches, Fabrizio Buonamassa Stigliani says he doesn’t approach his work as straightforward horology.
“I’m not a watch designer,” he said in a telephone interview from his office in Neuchâtel, Switzerland, where Bulgari Horlogerie, the Italian luxury house’s watchmaking division, is based. “I’m an industrial designer. During my career, I’ve designed chairs, shoes, sunglasses, jewels, motorcycles, cars, watches and many other things. For me, it’s a product.”
The watches that Mr. Buonamassa Stigliani has designed at Bulgari — where he has worked since 2001 except for a stint as an independent consultant for several brands — frequently include details that are clean and fuss-free, which might seem surprising from a brand that’s arguably best known for its bold jewelry and famous fans like Elizabeth Taylor and Sophia Loren.
For women, for example, he adjusted the Serpenti — a 1940s design named for its snakelike coils that twist up the wrist — by rendering its bracelet in black ceramic tiles, delicate gold chains or interchangeable leather straps, each connected to a softly angular timepiece.
