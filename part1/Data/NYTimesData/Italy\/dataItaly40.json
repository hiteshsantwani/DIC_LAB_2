MILAN â€” Italian media group Mediaset and its German rival ProSiebenSat.1 Media denied a media report on Saturday that they were in merger talks.
Earlier on Saturday daily newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore said the two companies were in talks to merge via a share exchange to create a pan-European independent broadcaster.
"No talks are being held for a merger with German TV group Prosiebensat1 Media," Mediaset said in a statement.
Max Conze, ProSiebenSat1 CEO, also denied talks.
"I see no industrial logic in combining," he said in an emailed statement.
