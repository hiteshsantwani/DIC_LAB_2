ROME â€” An investigation into corruption allegations against a junior minister from the far-right League prompted fresh conflict on Thursday within Italy's already troubled government.
The League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement formed a coalition last June, but relations between the two parties have grown increasingly sour ahead of EU elections in May, and there has been media speculation that the government might fall apart.
The latest row centred on Armando Siri, an undersecretary in the transport ministry, who learnt on Thursday that he had been placed under investigation for allegedly taking bribes to help companies operating in the renewable energy sector.
He denied the accusations, but in a move that infuriated the League, the 5-Star's Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli announced he was stripping Siri of his government responsibilities until his judicial position was clarified.
