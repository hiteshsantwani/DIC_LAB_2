What happens if you get a dream job, and it means giving up on your own name?
Increasingly that is an unavoidable choice for young designers who come to public attention by starting their own labels with a few friends, and even fewer funds, and then get snapped up by heritage names with big budgets, reputations and resources. There is one catch: The roles require full commitment.
Such was the dilemma facing Paul Andrew. Last month he was promoted from women’s wear and accessories design director at the Italian leather goods brand Salvatore Ferragamo to be creative director across all collections for the luxury house. His purview will extend to men’s wear and brand image strategy at a critical juncture for the business. Ferragamo, which in recent years has struggled to gain online visibility and win over younger luxury shoppers — and has recently been subject to takeover speculation — is in the midst of a major restructuring effort.
The demands of the new job will require Mr. Andrew to effectively relocate to Italy from New York, his long time home base and the headquarters of Paul Andrew, the namesake footwear line he started in 2012. Though he won the Council of Fashion Designers of America/Vogue Fashion Fund prize in 2014 on the strength of his label — and as of January, it was stocked by more than 100 wholesale partners — he chose to hit the pause button. His 2019 spring-summer collection will be the last one shipped to stores and sold online — for now — and excess stock will be donated to charity.
“It wasn’t the easiest decision by any means,” Mr. Andrew said by telephone from New York. “It wasn’t as if business was bad, and I have worked very hard to build the Paul Andrew brand into what it is today. But I’ve been offered such a big opportunity from Ferragamo, and I want it to be a success. There is a lot of work to do that will need my one focus and energy, not to mention a lot of time in Italy. This felt like the right call.”
