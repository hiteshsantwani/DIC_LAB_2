DESERTERS
Although the League and Forza Italia ran together in last year's ballot, their relationship has soured since Salvini abandoned his allies and formed a coalition with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement -- Berlusconi's bete noire.
The two groups still stand united in local elections, but the League has suggested it might not tie the knot again at a national level, worried that being associated with the elderly, out-of-mode Berlusconi would dent its newfound popularity.
"The longer we govern with 5-Star, the more it enters the public conscience and it would be hard to understand why the League would run with the center-right," said Riccardo Molinari, the League's parliamentary party leader in the lower house.
That League might nonetheless be interested in signing up disenchanted Forza Italia politicians, especially in the south where it is looking to extend its reach. The nationalist Brothers of Italy, another longtime Berlusconi ally, also appears eager to cannibalize its partner.
Italian politicians have a long tradition of switching parties -- in the last legislature almost 350 of the 945 parliamentarians changed sides for various reasons. They also have a habit of abandoning sinking ships.
Molinari laughed when asked if the League might be tempted to try to lure away Forza Italia lawmakers, particularly in the Senate where the coalition majority is in single digits.
"I think they might be tempted to join us. It is clear that there are lots of elected politicians from lots of parties that want to join the League," he said.
