VERONA, Italy â€” Italy's third biggest lender, Banco BPM, could be interested in tie-ups with banks close to its home turf in the north of the country, its CEO said on Saturday in comments that appeared to play down a possible deal with Monte dei Paschi di Siena.
Asked whether the bank, which is based in the Lombardy and Veneto regions, could consider a merger with Tuscan lender Monte dei Paschi, which was bailed out in 2017 and is 70 percent owned by the state, Giuseppe Castagna said on Saturday: "We look more at banks that are close to our territory."
