The president of the European Parliament apologized on Thursday after he said that Benito Mussolini, Italy’s fascist former leader, had done positive things despite leading his country into war and installing a totalitarian regime.
“As a convinced anti-fascist, I apologize to all those who may have been offended by what I said, which in no way intends to justify or play down an antidemocratic and totalitarian regime,” the president, Antonio Tajani, said in a statement.
His apology followed a radio interview on Wednesday in which he appeared to offer a positive slant on Mussolini’s dictatorship.
