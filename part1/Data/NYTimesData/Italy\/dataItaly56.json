SIENA, Italy â€” State-controlled Italian lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena always keeps in mind the potential for tie-ups with other banks, Chief Executive Marco Morelli said on Thursday.
Speaking at the bank's annual shareholder meeting, he said: "The board considers strategic opportunities, analysing possible tie-ups or changes in size which are then up to the shareholders to decide."
