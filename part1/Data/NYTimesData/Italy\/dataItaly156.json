ROME — Italy’s ambassador to Pakistan on Saturday announced the deaths of two climbers, one British and one Italian, who had been missing for weeks while climbing Nanga Parbat in Pakistan, the world’s ninth-highest mountain.
The ambassador, Stefano Pontecorvo, wrote on Twitter that “the silhouettes” of the climbers, Tom Ballard, 30, of Britain and Daniele Nardi, 42, of Italy had been spotted at about 5,900 meters (about 19,000 feet) on the mountain. “R.I.P.,” Mr. Pontecorvo said, and expressed “great sadness” at the discovery.
Mr. Pontecorvo said that the team of another European climber, Alex Txikon, had partly flown over the mountain and partly climbed it, and had recognized the two bodies by telescope.
Pakistani Army helicopters had searched the mountain for days, sometimes obstructed by bad winter weather and delayed when a military confrontation flared between India and Pakistan and the Pakistani airspace was closed.
