SEGRATE, Italy â€” Mediaset is in contact with various players over a cross-border tie-up but has no intention of including its shareholder Vivendi in any potential deal, the head of the holding controlling the Italian private broadcaster said.
Mediaset has been embroiled in a legal battle with Vivendi since 2016 when the French media conglomerate, controlled by billionaire Vincent Bollore, pulled out of a deal to buy Mediaset's pay-TV unit.
The broadcaster has repeatedly raised in recent months the idea of creating a pan-European TV player to fend off competition from established rivals and new entrants.
Most recently, speculation has intensified that Mediaset and German rival ProSiebenSat.1 Media could strike a deal, but the two companies denied press reports they were in merger talks over the weekend.
