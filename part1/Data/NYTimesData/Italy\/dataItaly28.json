ROME — Italian banks will discuss on Thursday whether to back the latest rescue plan for Banca Carige by taking a stake alongside a fund owned by U.S. asset manager BlackRock, two sources close to the talks said.
Carige was placed under special administration at the start of the year after the Malacalza family, its top investor, blocked a planned capital raising, derailing an industry-financed rescue plan.
Italian banks came to Carige's rescue in November by buying a 320 million euro (£277.6 million) hybrid bond needed to boost the bank's total capital ratio.
The sources said banks would discuss whether to convert that bond into equity to help fill Carige's 630 million euro capital shortfall, reducing the potential investment needed from the BlackRock fund.
