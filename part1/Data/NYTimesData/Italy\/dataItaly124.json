I had stumbled across William’s work at the Mudd Club in the early 1980s when some photos on the wall stopped me. They were portraits of musicians from the neighborhood, some of them my friends, taken in the present but with a formal tone of the past. I asked the bartender who made them, and he said the artist, William Coupon, lived just a couple of blocks away.
I met William and saw more of his images, which were beautiful. He was an artist who wanted to capture the beauty of people in social groups, and he saw the local musicians who played at the club as a community, a contemporary tribe. That feeling also informs his photos from Cafe’tal, where echoes of the past linger. Fat Carmine Aquilino tells stories about the old neighborhood photos on the wall. So does Joe Perrotta, the cafe’s owner. Recently, he pointed to a 50-year-old photograph of men playing cards around a table in the same room we were in: “That’s my father.”
Mr. Perrotta said that it’s not only important that the dishes on the menu evoke memories of the past, like Sunday Gravy, but that the same space continues to bring people together. Poker gave way to tales of stickball matches, shared baby photos and antipasto for the table.
