MILAN — Italian payments group Nexi has priced what is set to be one of Europe's biggest initial public offerings this year at 9 euros per share, valuing the group's equity at 5.7 billion euros (£4.9 billion).
The price, which confirmed what sources told Reuters on Thursday, was at the bottom of a price range that had narrowed to between 9.0 euros and 9.5 euros.
Nexi said in a statement on Friday the deal valued the company at 7.3 billion euros including debt, the equivalent of 17.2 times its core earnings. That is roughly in line with average industry valuations, according to one analyst's report.
It plans to float 35.6 percent of the company on the market, rising to 40.9 percent if an overallotment option is exercised.
