ROME â€” The three metro stops serving the heart of Rome are shut because of decrepit escalators, a new blow to a city already struggling with a garbage crisis, potholed roads and tumbling trees.
The problem first emerged last October when an escalator collapsed in Repubblica station, injuring 24 people. Most locals expected the stop to re-open within days. Six months later, it remains closed. And this past month, worries about escalators closed two more city-centre stations.
"The impact on business and on the city's image is disastrous," said Valter Gianmaria, president of Rome's Confesercenti retailers' association. "How can Rome compete with other European cities?"
According to the World Metro Database, Rome has one of the smallest underground networks of any major European city -- just 61 km (38 miles) of tracks. By comparison, Madrid has 293 km and London 402 km, Europe's largest underground network.
