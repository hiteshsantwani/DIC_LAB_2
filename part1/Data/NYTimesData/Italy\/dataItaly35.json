ROME â€” Italy's right-wing League has presented prominent anti-euro campaigners among its candidates for next month's European Parliament elections, reviving doubt about the ruling party's commitment to the single currency.
Antonio Rinaldi, who teaches economics at Rome's Link Campus University and is a frequent guest on television talk shows, has campaigned for years for Italy to "take back the keys to our own house" by leaving the euro zone.
Francesca Donato, another candidate on the party's slate presented on Wednesday, is president of Italy's Eurexit Association, whose goal declared on its website is "to leave the euro to relaunch our economy and re-establish democracy."
Anti-euro campaigners say quitting the euro would allow Italy to revive its stagnant economy by spending more and devaluing its currency, helping exports. Others warn the move would lead to a flight of capital, higher borrowing costs and inflation, reducing the value of Italians' savings.
