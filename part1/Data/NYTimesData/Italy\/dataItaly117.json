The furniture and object designer F. Taylor Colantonio, dressed in a red-trimmed poet’s blouse, gives a gentle shove to a fluted Doric column in his small, theatrically furnished loft in the Campo de’ Fiori neighborhood of Rome. The column wobbles loose from the wall, revealing itself suddenly to be light as Styrofoam, phony as a stage set. “Everything in my house is fake,” says Colantonio. “I’m a punk collector. It’s all fake.”
In addition to working on interior design projects for private clients, Colantonio, 30, creates surrealist objects, which range from coiled-rope vases to snakelike rebar candlesticks to transparent rugs. Championed by Alex Eagle, the owner of the Store, and the design dealer Jermaine Gallacher (who both sell his work in their London boutiques), his pieces are often offbeat interpretations of chintzy suburban décor and imitations of antiquity.
At his apartment’s towering picture window, a ceramic tiger — a flea market find as big as a real cub — stands guard, across from a daybed upholstered with hand-painted violet-striped linen. Colantonio composed an intricate savanna mural for the wall above — tropical creatures amid palms and yellow roses — rendered in the chalky children’s tempera paints he prefers. In the dining alcove, in front of a collection of modern ceramic vases inspired by ancient urns, is a black-and-cream vase of his own creation. It occupies a 19th-century walnut table and recalls a Greek kylix, but it flops, uncannily, to one side, its body made not of rigid and impermeable pottery, but of softly coiled machine-braided rope. “The wonkiness gives it personality and gesture,” Colantonio explains, lifting it by its squishy lollipop-like handles. The vase is a vase in idea only. A fake.
