It’s clear why filmmakers can’t resist the allure of Alfred Hitchcock even if they inevitably fall short of him. But his imitators rarely come up with movies as pointless as “Naples in Veils,” which tips its hat vigorously toward the master’s motifs — the lost-and-found doubling of “Vertigo,” the repressed trauma of “Marnie,” possibly even Salvador Dalí’s eye design from “Spellbound” — only to wind up as a tedious muddle.
Adriana (Giovanna Mezzogiorno), a pathologist in Naples who is shy with men, has a one-night stand with Andrea (Alessandro Borghi), a much younger diver. The sex is rendered with a level of detail that seems more suited to a Euro-art remake of “Fifty Shades of Grey” than a Hitchcock riff — but then again, it’s supposed to become an obsession for Adriana. They make plans to meet at a museum the next day, except Andrea doesn’t show up.
