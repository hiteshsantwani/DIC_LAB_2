ROME/MILAN — Troubled Italian bank Carige could need a larger-than-expected cash injection of at least 700 million euros (£607 million) under a rescue plan put forward by U.S. asset manager BlackRock, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Temporary administrators appointed by the European Central Bank to run Carige are trying to find a buyer for Italy's 10th-largest bank by mid-May, after its top shareholder derailed an industry-financed rescue by blocking a 400 million euro cash call in December.
A specialist fund run by BlackRock is the only known potential bidder although Italy's government stands ready to step in should a private buyer fail to clinch a deal.
The government, which in 2017 took over Italy's then third-largest bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena, has earmarked up to 1 billion euros to buy Carige shares by the end of September under emergency measures approved at the start of the year.
