“The Dolomites have all the greatness of Italy, but transported to the mountains,” says Massimo Bottura, a habitual visitor to his country’s sharp-summited, northern territory in the Alps. The chef of Osteria Francescana in the small north Italian town of Modena, which topped the 2018 World’s 50 Best Restaurants list, Mr. Bottura has little interest in schussing down the area’s famously seductive slopes. “I hate to ski,” he admits. “But I love the kind of eating on offer in the mountains.” Lara Gilmore, his wife, business partner, and (unlike Mr. Bottura) an irrepressible ski enthusiast, insists they get there often enough to appease both of their appetites. Here, Mr. Bottura shares his five favorite places, on- and off-piste to eat in the Dolomites.
1. Restaurant St. Hubertus at Hotel Rosa Alpina
St. Hubertus, which is run by Mr. Bottura’s friend, the star chef Norbert Niederkofler, is like Osteria Francescana, one of the few restaurants in the world to be awarded three Michelin stars — yet it’s the informal affability of the staff that feels most familiar to Mr. Bottura. “It’s that super friendly Italian approach we like — simple, not stiff,” he says. “And watching Norbert at work in the open kitchen, and eating his special mountain flavors — it can change your entire vision of life.” While the peaks are gastronomically anchored by this long-running restaurant, Mr. Bottura notes that it was Mr. Niederkofler who “pushed these small mountain lodges to become ambitious restaurants.”
