An Italian shipping company admitted in the U.S. to dumping oily waste and other pollutants at sea rather than paying to dispose of them properly, and will pay a $4 million fine.
U.S. authorities in New Jersey say d'Amico Shipping Italia S.p.A. pleaded guilty Wednesday in Newark to violating the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships.
The charge involved the oil tanker Cielo di Milano that visited ports in New Jersey, Maryland and Florida multiple times in 2014 and 2015.
The Palermo-based company admitted that the ship's crew intentionally discharged bilge water and oily waste from the vessel's engine room into the sea, according to court documents.
