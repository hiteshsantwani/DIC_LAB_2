The art of the Argentine-Italian modernist Lucio Fontana looks like it comes from another planet, and it might as well, given how seldom we see it in New York. The exhibition “Lucio Fontana: On the Threshold,” at the Met Breuer, with spillovers at the Met Fifth Avenue and El Museo del Barrio, is the artist’s first museum survey here in more than 40 years.
This wouldn’t be especially notable — plenty of his Latin American peers never get seen at all — were Fontana, who died in 1968, not so influential a figure. The “threshold” of the title refers not only to the early phase of his career, which the show highlights, but also to his position as a forebear of contemporary art as we know it. Things we take for granted — installation, new media and the poly-disciplinary impulse that defines so many 21st-century careers — Fontana pioneered in the 1950s.
Part of the reception problem lies precisely in his breadth. When an artist toggles between figurative sculpture and television art, where do you land? Then there’s the pretty-ugly look of the work. Some of it is just weird as hell. Painting surfaces are punched or slashed through, or ooze as if with eruptive disease. Some of his ceramic sculptures suggest fecal deposits; others, pods swollen with alien life. His colors can be crazy: screaming pink, bruisy blue. Pictures in one series are all starchy white; those in another glint with chunks of colored glass, embedded like jewels on reliquaries.
