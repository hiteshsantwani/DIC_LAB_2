MILAN â€” Italy's government has no intention of calling into question the future of the euro zone or the European Union, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Friday.
"Our government will not call into question the euro zone or the EU, and I am speaking on behalf of everyone", Di Maio said at a conference in Milan.
Di Maio leads the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement which governs with the right-wing League.
Both parties often criticise EU governance and once campaigned for Italy to exit the euro zone, but since forming a coalition last June they have frequently stressed that an Italexit is not on the government's agenda.
