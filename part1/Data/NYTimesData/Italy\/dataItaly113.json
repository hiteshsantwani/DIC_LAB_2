He looked like a handsome doctor straight out of a TV series.
On his Facebook page, Dr. Matthew Mode promoted cosmetic procedures, including surgery, performed at a clinic in a wealthy part of the Romanian capital, Bucharest. He posed in blue scrubs with a broad smile and a syringe of Botox.
But the authorities in Romania said this week that he was not authorized to practice medicine there, and questions have been raised about whether he is really a doctor.
Oh, and his name isn’t Matthew Mode.
Romanian health authorities began looking into Matteo Politi — the name he used before calling himself Matthew Mode — after news reports that he had operated on at least one woman without proper credentials. Almost a year after he began practicing medicine in Bucharest, prosecutors there have opened a criminal investigation into his actions.
On Wednesday morning, Romanian border guards found him trying to leave the country on a train bound for Budapest, removed him and handed him over to the police.
