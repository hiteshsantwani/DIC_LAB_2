MILAN â€” The European Central Bank has pushed back a deadline to submit binding bids for troubled Italian lender Carige to mid-May so as to give a specialist fund run by BlackRock more time, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The BlackRock fund is the only group still known to be considering a bid. One of the sources said it needed more time to study a possible offer, given all the moving parts involved.
Carige was placed under special administration at the start of the year after its top investor blocked a planned capital raising, derailing an industry-financed rescue plan.
The ECB has asked the three commissioners it put in charge of the Genoa-based bank to find a buyer for Carige, which needs to fill a 630 million euro (543.08 million pounds) capital shortfall.
