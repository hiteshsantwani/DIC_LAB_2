NAPLES, Italy â€” Napoli coach Carlo Ancelotti has demanded "courage, intelligence and heart" from his team as they attempt to overturn a two-goal deficit against Arsenal in the Europa League quarter-finals.
Bidding to win their first European trophy since a Diego Maradona-inspired side won the old UEFA Cup in 1989, Napoli host the English Premier League side on Thursday in the second leg of their tie, trailing 2-0 from last week's first match.
"In three words, we need courage, intelligence and heart," Ancelotti told reporters. "I saw only a little courage in the early stages of the first game. Intelligence, I saw in both halves of the match. Heart is something we will put in tomorrow.
"In addition, we need a significant dose of intensity. We must seize this opportunity, we need a positive mental attitude and, I repeat, a lot of heart. And there will be an extraordinary environment to drag us."
