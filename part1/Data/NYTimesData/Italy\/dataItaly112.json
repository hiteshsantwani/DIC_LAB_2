ROME — Home to the Vatican, the pope and St. Peter’s Basilica, Rome is unchallenged in its claim to be the global center of the Roman Catholic Church.
But the city also plays host to the largest mosque in Western Europe, the largest Jehovah’s Witness Kingdom Hall on the Continent, and, as of this year, the biggest center in Europe belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Occupying a 15-acre site near Rome’s outer ring road, the enormous temple atop a hill, nearly 10 years in the making, was hard to miss during its construction, arousing the curiosity of Romans, regardless of their faith.
Which may explain why so many Italians — more than 50,000 — visited the temple during an extended open house ahead of its formal dedication in March. After that, only church members in good standing will be able to enter, though everyone is welcome on the grounds, officials said.
