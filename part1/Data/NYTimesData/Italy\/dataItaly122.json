One significant restoration of the cartoon was carried out in 1797-78 at the Louvre in Paris, where it ended up — along with other works — after Napoleon’s troops swept through northern Italy in 1796.
Since 1966 it has been on display in its own room at the Pinacoteca, but it was set back behind a guardrail. In the new arrangement, visitors can walk directly up to vitrine, made by the Italian display case experts Goppion, who claim it is the largest single-door vitrine in the world.
Five years ago, the cartoon came under the scrutiny of a fresh crop of scholars and restorers, who were concerned about its state of conservation. Funded through a private donation, the restoration took four years because of its complex nature, and required various stages of intervention, said the chief restorer, Maurizio Michelozzi. It might have taken time, but it served to provide “a better understanding of the masterpiece,” Mr. Michelozzi said.
