BRUSSELS â€” France on Wednesday blocked a European Union statement calling on Khalifa Haftar to halt his eastern forces' offensive in Libya, diplomatic sources said, in the latest example of how the bloc's internal divisions have undercut its global sway.
The draft statement, seen by Reuters, would have said that the military attack launched by Haftar on Tripoli was "endangering the civilian population, disrupting the political process and risks further escalation with serious consequences for Libya and the wider region, including the terrorist threat."
Thousands of residents fled on Wednesday as Haftar's forces - called the Libyan National Army (LNA) - and troops loyal to the Tripoli government battled on the outskirts of Libya's capital.
France and Italy disagree on how to handle the latest escalation in the troubled north African country.
