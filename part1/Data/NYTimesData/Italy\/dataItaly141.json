(Reuters) - The U.S. government should not restrict Qatar Airways or Air Italy from flying to the United States because it may lead to the unraveling of other aviation agreements around the world, three U.S. airlines said in a letter to officials on Wednesday.
Washington is scrutinizing state-owned Qatar Airways' acquisition of 49 percent of Air Italy, which has been flying to U.S. destinations since June, a deal that U.S. lawmakers say may have violated a commitment by the Gulf airline not to add new flights to the domestic market.
But in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, JetBlue Airways Corp and cargo carriers FedEx Corp and Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc said restricting the rights of Qatar Airways and Air Italy could lead to retaliation against U.S. carriers.
"For JetBlue, who just announced its intention to begin service to London from New York City and Boston starting in 2021, the possibility of retaliation could have a devastating impact on the ability to obtain authority to operate in the EU under the U.S.-EU Open Skies agreement," the airlines said.
