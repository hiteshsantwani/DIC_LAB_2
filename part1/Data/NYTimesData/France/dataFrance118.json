PARIS â€” German chemical group Bayer said it was considering its legal options, including an appeal, after a French court ruled in favor of a farmer who blamed a weedkiller of Bayer's Monsanto unit for health problems.
Thursday's ruling by an appeals court in Lyon in southeast France was the latest stage in a decade-long legal tussle between Monsanto and farmer Paul Francois, who says he fell ill after inhaling weedkiller Lasso in 2004.
Bayer said in a statement that its options included filing an appeal with France's highest court.
