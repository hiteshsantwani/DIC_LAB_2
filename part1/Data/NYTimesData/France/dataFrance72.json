PARIS â€” Ukraine's beleaguered president traveled to Germany and France on Friday ahead of a presidential runoff in which he is trailing a comic actor who is a political novice. His rival headed to Paris only.
Polls show Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko behind by a wide margin ahead of the April 21 runoff against Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Germany and France, which have led diplomatic efforts for years trying to ease tensions between warring neighbors Ukraine and Russia, are following the election closely.
Macron successively met with Zelenskiy and Porochenko at the Elysee presidential palace in Paris.
"We had a very constructive conversation," Zelenskiy was quoted as saying by Russia's state news agency as saying after the talks. "It was a pleasure to meet Mr. Macron."
He would not elaborate.
After his meeting with the French president, Poroshenko later tweeted that he was "happy to meet with a sincere friend of Ukraine."
