NEW DELHI â€” India on Saturday said a French media report linking a tax exemption given to a French subsidiary of India's Reliance Group and an $8.7 billion fighter jet deal between the two countries was "totally inaccurate."
French newspaper Le Monde reported on Saturday that France waived a tax demand of 143.7 million euros on a French subsidiary of Reliance Communications in 2015 when it was negotiating to sell the jets to India. The longstanding tax dispute was resolved between February and October that year, Le Monde said.
India's Ministry of Defence said on Saturday the report was drawing a conjectural connection between the tax relief and the jet deal.
"Neither the period of the tax concession nor the subject matter of the concession relate even remotely to the Rafale procurement concluded during the tenure of the present government," the ministry said in a statement.
