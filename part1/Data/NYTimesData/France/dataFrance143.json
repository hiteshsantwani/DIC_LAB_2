PARIS â€” French TV group TF1 will exclusively broadcast the 2019 Rugby World Cup in France, it said on Wednesday, lifting the shares of the country's major TV broadcaster.
"After the success of previous editions, notably during the 2011 final between France and the All Blacks with 17.8 million viewers and 87 percent of audience share, TF1 Group will offer the French audience all 48 matches of the 2019 Rugby World Cup," TF1 said in a statement.
TF1 shares were up 4.1 percent at 0750 GMT, and were the best performers on Paris' SBF-120 index, as analysts and fund managers welcomed the contract win.
"Given the sluggishness of the overall advertising market, any bit of good news regarding TV advertising is going to be well received by the market. In that context, winning exclusive rights for the Rugby World Cup - even if it's not as big as the soccer World Cup - is a good bit of news for TF1," said Gregoire Laverne, fund manager at Roche Brune Asset Management.
