If 3-D printing can be used to make a gun, why not a watch? So reasoned a collection of creative minds in Besançon, France’s watch center. And then they did.
The watch, named Specimen 01, has been called France’s answer to the Lo Scienziato Luminor 1950 Tourbillon GMT Titanio, which the Richemont-owned brand Officine Panerai introduced in 2016 as the world’s first high-end mechanical watch made by 3-D printing and which carried a six-figure price tag.
Besançon’s model, which sells for a more accessible 965 euros, or $1,099, was presented as the first automatic mechanical watch made by 3-D printing in France. And, unlike the 3-D Panerai, which was adapted from an existing model, it is said to be the first designed to be mass-produced.
