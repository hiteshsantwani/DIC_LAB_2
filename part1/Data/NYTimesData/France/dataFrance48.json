3) 7:30 p.m. Double delight
Many of Marseille’s immigrant waves washed up in the Panier district, a village-like maze of narrow cobbled streets, tiny squares and weather-beaten houses in sherbet colors. Rue de Lorette serves up two classic flavors of Mediterranean Marseille. Start your two-stage ethno-bloat with one of the two thin, crispy pizza options — anchovy or cheese (15 euros) — at Chez Etienne, a lively tile and timber restaurant founded by Sicilians in 1943. The former is all zesty red sauce and fresh fish; the latter is agreeably gloppy and gooey. Crossing the street, you arrive in Morocco at Ahwash, a stylish living room-like restaurant and boutique. For your main course, you can plunge into roasted lamb, chicken tajine with preserved lemons (16 euros) or an excellent tajine of stringy-soft beef, long-stewed peppers and caramelized onions (16 euros). Take home Moroccan glassware, ceramics or candles .

4) 10 p.m. Local anesthesia
Formerly a hospital, the grandiose 18th-century building holding the Intercontinental Marseille — Hotel Dieu now offers sedation in the form of wines, beers, spirits (notably gin) and cocktails, courtesy of Le Capian bar. A soaring space outfitted with plush couches and carpets, the establishment pours out numerous Provençal products, including Doucillon beer (10 euros) and Le Daviel cocktails (pastis, lychee liqueur, spice syrup and Champagne; 21 euros). If those don’t stupefy you, the view of the illuminated harbor almost certainly will.
