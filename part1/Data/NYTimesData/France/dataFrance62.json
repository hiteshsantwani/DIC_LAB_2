LONDON — Iran protested to France on Sunday over comments by the French ambassador in Washington concerning Tehran's right to enrich uranium after 2025.
Tehran agreed under a 2015 deal with world powers to restrict its nuclear program in return for the lifting of sanctions that had crippled its economy.
Some of these limits are due to be removed after 10 years, and some others after 15 years.
However, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal last year, saying one of the defects in the accord is that limits on the Iranian nuclear program start to expire.
On Saturday, France's ambassador to the United States, Gérard Araud, said on Twitter: "It's false to say that at the expiration of the JCPOA (the nuclear deal), Iran will be allowed to enrich uranium," adding that sanctions could be reimposed.
