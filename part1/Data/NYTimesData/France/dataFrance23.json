PARIS — In the thousands of town halls and gymnasiums where the French government has organized “great debates” as a response to the “Yellow Vest” protests, one group has been noticeably absent: young people.
So rather than keep hoping that French youth will show up in person, on Tuesday the government met them (at least some of them) where they already are in virtual form. Ten government ministers took part in an 11--hour discussion that appeared live on Twitch, a popular platform best known for showing people playing video games.
“I understand why there are not a lot of young people in these meetings,” Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said on Tuesday, as he discussed the nationwide series of discussions known as the Great National Debate. “They are interested in politics, but maybe not in that way, so we must adapt.”
President Emmanuel Macron, whose popularity has plunged since he took office in 2017, embarked on the national debate in an attempt to defuse the anger of the Yellow Vest demonstrators, a movement that began in response to a proposal to raise fuel taxes but has developed into a much wider threat to his political fortunes and economic plans.
