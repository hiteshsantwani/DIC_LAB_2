PARIS â€” French President Emmanuel Macron has postponed an important address to the nation that was to lay out his responses to the yellow vest crisis because of the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.
Macron was planning to announce on Monday evening a series of measures after three months of a national debate that encouraged ordinary people to propose changes to France's economy and democracy.
Instead he headed to the scene of the fire.
The French presidency didn't reschedule the speech yet.
When he does speak, Macron is expected to respond to protesters' concerns over their loss of purchasing power with possible tax cuts and measures to help retirees and single parents.
Other proposed changes could affect France's democratic rules. Some observers say Macron may open up the possibility that citizens could propose referendums.
