PARIS â€” French insurance firm AXA said on Tuesday it provided insurance coverage for two of the contracting firms that were working on Notre-Dame's restoration prior to the blaze that devastated the cathedral.
The fire ripped through the cathedral's roof, where workers from a number of contractors had been carrying out extensive renovations to the spire's timber-framed supports. Police have begun questioning the workers involved, the prosecutor's office has said.
In a statement released on Tuesday, AXA said its staff were cooperating fully with investigators.
The French insurer also said it provided insurance coverage for some of the relics and religious artworks displayed in the cathedral.
An AXA spokesman declined to estimate the company's potential liabilities associated with the damage caused.
