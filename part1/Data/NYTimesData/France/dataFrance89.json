BUCHAREST â€” France is not specifically targeting U.S. internet giants with a planned tax on digital service companies, its finance minister said in an interview, pushing back against pressure from Washington to drop the levy.
The U.S. State Department said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged France in a meeting with his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian on Thursday not to approve the digital services tax, saying it would hurt U.S. technology firms.
"France is not leading a crusade against the United States. The United States are an ally and a friend of France. France is leading a crusade against tax injustice - it's not the same thing," Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Reuters.
Speaking in Bucharest where he was attending a meeting with EU counterparts, he added that France was far from alone in Europe in its support for creating minimum taxation of digital service companies, with Austria, Britain, Spain and Italy also pressing ahead with own plans
