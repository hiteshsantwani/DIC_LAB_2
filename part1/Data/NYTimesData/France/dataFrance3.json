Leo is also in love with Ahd, who can be sensitive and protective; he allows Leo to cuddle with him the morning after a party and later helps him recoup money from clients who rough him up. But Ahd advises him to leave the grind. “Find an old guy,” he says. “A nice one. It’s the best that can happen to us.” But whether Leo desires to escape is an unsettled question.
The film doesn’t avoid addressing certain dangers of prostitution. Leo is shown being graphically violated, and the men fear a would-be client known as “the pianist,” who is known for twisted tastes. Also Leo, a chronic crack user who midway through the film receives a diagnosis for a possible lung infection, doesn’t look like he is in enviable health.
But in both conception and conclusion, the movie takes a pie-eyed view of Leo’s ostensible wildness, as if living on the streets, drug addiction and charging money for sex were just radical expressions of liberty. Vidal-Naquet sells this facile notion by keeping his protagonist a borderline cipher — even-tempered, accommodating, seemingly at peace with drifting. It’s tough to build a character study around an unconvincing character.
