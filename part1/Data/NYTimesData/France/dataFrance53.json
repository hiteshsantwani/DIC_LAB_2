President Emmanuel Macron wants each April 7 to become a day of commemoration of the "genocide of Tutsis" in Rwanda, now marking the 25th anniversary of the start of the ethnic slaughter of some 800,000 people, mainly ethnic Tutsis.
In a brief statement Sunday, April 7, the day the slaughter began a quarter century ago, Macron expressed "solidarity with the Rwandan people." A remembrance is being held Sunday in Paris, but Macron is not attending.
On Friday, Macron ordered a commission of researchers and historians to scour archives "to analyze the role and involvement of France" in Rwanda from 1990-1994.
Critics say France was too supportive of Rwanda's Hutu-led government whose supporters carried out the genocide, with some saying French soldiers there were complicit — which France denies.
