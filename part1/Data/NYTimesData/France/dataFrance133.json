The French are dominating action at the Grand Prix Hassan II in Marrakesh, Morocco, where fourth seed Gilles Simon, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Benoit Paire were all winners in the quarterfinals Friday.
It will be the first time since Simon, Tsonga and Julien Benneteau turned the trick in 2008 that there will be three Frenchmen in the tournament's semifinals.
Simon needed two hours and 34 minutes to defeat Japan's Taro Daniel, 6-4, 7-5, saving 12 of 15 break points along the way to earn a spot in the semis against Spain's Pablo Andujar, who advanced when Jiri Vesely withdrew with a right toe injury. Andujar has won the tournament three times (2011-12, 2018), while Simon proved victorious in 2008.
Tsonga had a much easier time shutting down Italian qualifier Lorenzo Sonego, taking just 67 minutes to emerge with a 6-3, 6-2 triumph, thanks to winning 26 of his 29 first-service points.
