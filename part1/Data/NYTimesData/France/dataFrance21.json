PARIS — The authorities here said on Monday that the French film director Luc Besson would face no charges after a nine-month inquiry into an actress’s accusations that he had raped her.
An official at the Paris prosecutor’s office, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with official policy, said that “numerous investigations” by the Paris police couldn’t show that Mr. Besson, 59, had coerced the Dutch-Belgian actress Sand Van Roy into unwanted sex.
Ms. Van Roy, a 28-year-old actress who filed a lawsuit against Mr. Besson in May and a second one in July, accused him of raping her on at least four occasions, and said he once injured her “to the point of bleeding.” In an interview with The New York Times in July, she described a two-year-long “abusive” relationship with Mr. Besson and said she was afraid to turn down his advances out of fear that it would hurt her career.
According to the first lawsuit, Ms. Van Roy told the police in May on the day after the sexual contact that she said made her bleed: “I’m afraid he might kill me, he is a psychopath.”
