Claude Lalanne, a sculptor with a whimsical streak whose metalwork included quirky cutlery, an apple with lips, and bronze cabbages standing on chicken legs, died on April 10 in Fontainebleau, France. She was 93.
The Kasmin Gallery, her New York representative, announced her death on its website.
Ms. Lalanne and her husband, the sculptor François-Xavier Lalanne, who died in 2008, were known collectively as “Les Lalanne,” and their work was coveted by collectors, who often paid attention-getting prices for it. Despite their collective billing, they didn’t collaborate often; rather, they shared a fondness for the unexpected.
