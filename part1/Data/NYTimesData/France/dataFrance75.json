LONDON â€” France showed they were champions in virtual soccer as well as the real game on Sunday when they beat Argentina to win the inaugural FIFA eNations Cup and a $40,000 (30,588.06 pounds) prize.
Twenty countries from six confederations were entered in the esports event, with World Cup winners France represented by Corentin 'Maestro' Thullier and Lucas 'DaXe' Cuillerier.
The players wore national team jerseys as they competed on PlayStation and XBox with both one-on-one FIFA 19 matches and two v two.
Teams were divided into four groups of five before the knock-out stage.
"DaXe and I had some really tough matches over the two days so to come away as champions and the title of the best eFootball nation in the world is really special," said Thullier, the world number six on the PS4 platform.
