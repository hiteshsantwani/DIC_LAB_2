Emmanuel Macron’s victory over the far-right National Front party in the French presidential election came only a few months after the ascension of Donald J. Trump to the presidency of the United States, and less than a year after Britain voted to leave the European Union. The outcome, installing a centrist leader, elicited a mixture of euphoria and relief from the establishment. A CNBC.com headline from the day captured this emotion: ”’Phew!’ World reacts as Macron becomes next French president.”
Those hoping that Mr. Macron’s election would reverse the tide of nationalist and authoritarian leaders coming to power were disappointed to learn that his domestic popularity was fleeting. Anyone still rooting for a Macron comeback was rudely awakened by the scale and ferocity of the Yellow Vest movement, whose mass demonstrations began in November. One of the few consistent demands of the protesters has been the resignation of President Macron.
The author Christophe Guilluy — who describes himself as a geographer, although he mostly served as a housing consultant after graduating from college in 1987 — has concerned himself with the growing cultural and economic fissures animating the recent protests. He has written four books on the topic since 2010, and the third of these, originally published in 2016, has just been translated by Yale University Press as “Twilight of the Elites: Prosperity, the Periphery and the Future of France.” Despite the hectoring tone, unfounded generalizations and conspiratorial allusions, the book still manages to provide an indispensable guide to understanding the fears and frustrations of an increasingly permanent underclass — not just in France, but throughout the world.
