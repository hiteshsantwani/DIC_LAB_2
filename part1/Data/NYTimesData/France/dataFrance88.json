PARIS â€” French lawmakers adopted on Thursday a government bill aimed at kickstarting a wave of privatisations, including a sale of the state's stake in airports group ADP, to raise cash for a new innovation fund.
The Assemblee Nationale - in which President Emmanuel Macron's centrist LREM party has a commanding majority - voted in favour of the so-called "Loi Pacte" legislation bill, with 147 votes in favour of the bill versus 50 against.
"This is a law which will help our economy and prepare us for the future," French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters in the parliament.
"We want to make ADP a world champion in terms of airport traffic," he added.
Macron's government has consistently said it aims to start the ADP privatisation process in 2019, but the plan has been criticised by some opposition parties over fears it could result in job cuts or a loss of control for a key national asset.
