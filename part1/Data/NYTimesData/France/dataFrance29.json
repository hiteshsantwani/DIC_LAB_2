Being ousted by a company that had resisted doing so would be the latest turn in a swift, stunning fall from grace for Mr. Ghosn, a larger-than-life car industry figure who forged a global business empire that bound Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors together in what was known as the Alliance.
The public push for Mr. Ghosn’s removal from Renault came after senior French officials flew to Tokyo after the Tuesday bail hearing. Martin Vial, one of two French government representatives on the Renault board, and Emmanuel Moulin, Mr. Le Maire’s chief of staff, are expected to meet Japanese officials and Nissan stakeholders during the trip, which was planned a few days ago, according to a Finance Ministry spokeswoman.
The carmakers must move quickly to try to put the blowup behind them.
Demand for cars in China, the United States and Europe, the three biggest markets, is falling. Analysts say the partnership that Renault and Nissan founded in 1999 to share purchasing and expertise is essential if the companies are to stay competitive in an industry where size provides a crucial advantage.
In a nod to the importance of scale, Ford Motor and Volkswagen outlined on Monday what they hope will become their own broad alliance to speed the development of electric and self-driving cars, potentially creating competition for the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance on that front.
Nissan and Mitsubishi removed Mr. Ghosn from their boards immediately after his initial arrest on Nov. 19, but Renault and the French government have maintained that he had a “presumption of innocence.” Privately, though, succession plans were being prepared in case of a prolonged detention. Because Mr. Ghosn still faces a long trial in Japan, he cannot carry out his executive functions.
