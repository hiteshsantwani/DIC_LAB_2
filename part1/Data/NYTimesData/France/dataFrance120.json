PARIS â€” France will propose a new "growth contract" with its euro zone partners to encourage northern countries in the bloc to invest more and for southern countries to undertake further reforms, its finance minister said on Wednesday.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he would make the proposal to his euro zone counterparts on Thursday on the sidelines of a G7 meeting in Washington.
"We can't just stand there with our arms crossed in the face of the marked and worrying global slowdown," Le Maire told a French parliamentary finance commission.
"I think euro zone finance and economy ministers have a responsibility to take action," he added.
The global economic outlook has dimmed rapidly in recent months amid trade tensions and Brexit worries, the International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday, downgrading its outlook for the third time since October.
