In the ANSM letter this week, which the French newspaper Le Monde published on its website, Dr. Christelle Ratignier-Carbonneil, deputy director-general of the agency, asked manufacturers to remove their implants from the market, “in view of the rare but serious danger that their implantation is likely to constitute.”
Nearly 500,000 women have breast implants in France. In 2018, macro-textured and polyurethane implants represented 27 percent of sales, according to the ANSM. Over the past five years, some 70,000 women are thought to have received the implants, which do not slip out of place or rotate, unlike smooth ones. They are also less likely than smooth ones to cause thick scarring around the implant, which is common and requires more surgery.
Joëlle Manighetti, a French activist who started a blog on breast implants after suffering from faulty ones, praised the decision as going “beyond our recommendations.”
“I now hope that there will be a serious follow-up of the other breast implants still on the market,” she said.
Breast implants came under scrutiny in France in the last decade, in a landmark case involving the company Poly Implant Prothèse, which was accused of selling hundreds of thousands of defective implants in 65 countries.
After a trial that involved more than 7,000 defendants, the company’s founder, Jean-Claude Mas, and four former employees were found guilty of aggravated fraud in 2012. Mr. Mas, who died Thursday at age 79, was later sentenced to four years in prison.
