PARIS — Thousands rallied against anti-Semitism in Paris on Tuesday night, summoned by France’s major political parties, the country’s Jewish organizations, and by a sharp spike in anti-Semitic incidents, including the desecration of a Jewish cemetery the night before.
That act of vandalism drew France’s president to a small village in the northeast, hours before huge crowds filled one of the capital’s historic squares, Place de la République, and stood silently in the winter twilight for brief remarks by a rabbi and a rendition of the national anthem, before dispersing in solemn silence.
At the square, there appeared to be many Jews and some non-Jews, students and well-dressed Parisians, many retired people and a scattering of the young. Many said they had come because of a new, unaccustomed fear.
“Fear in my gut. With all that’s going on,” said Joelle Malachane, a retired office worker at the rally with her daughter. “I’m scared for the future of the Jews. It’s not easy being a Jew now.”
