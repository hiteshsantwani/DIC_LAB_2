LONDON â€” Taking on the Big Four accounting firms will remain a lengthy and costly challenge for smaller rivals in Britain despite the regulatory leg-up unveiled on Thursday, but France has shown it can be done over a decade.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has ordered that Britain's top 350 listed companies must hire two auditors to loosen the grip of EY, KPMG, Deloitte and PwC that individually check the books of all but nine of those companies.
It forms a package of measures from the CMA aimed at improving audit quality and restoring trust after accounting failures at construction company Carillion and retailer BHS.
Though the changes are likely to take some time to make it into law, joint audits in France have enabled smaller rivals like Mazars to work alongside the Big Four and win the confidence of bigger clients.
