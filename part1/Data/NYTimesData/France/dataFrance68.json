BRUSSELS â€” A departure of Britain from the EU without a deal might be preferable than obstruction of EU operations by the British if they were to remain a member against their will, a spokesman for French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday.
"Not everything is preferable to a no-deal. A no-deal situation is a real option," a French presidency official said.
The official added that the current state of negotiations did not include sufficient guarantees against possible obstructions to justify a long extension in France's views.
