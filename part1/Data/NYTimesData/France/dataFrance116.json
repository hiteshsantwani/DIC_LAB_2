PARIS â€” France's opposition Socialist Party on Tuesday said it had enough support in parliament to start the process of forcing a national referendum on the government's plan to privatise airport operator ADP, a Socialist lawmaker said.
The next threshold that must be met for a referendum on the possible privatisation of ADP is for a nationwide petition to garner 4.5 million signatories.
The sale of all or part of the state's 50.6 percent stake in ADP is part of the government's strategy to cut the budget deficit and finance a long-promised 10 billion euro (8.62 billion pounds) innovation fund.
In March, the National Assembly, where Macron's En Marche party holds a strong majority, approved draft legislation for the possible privatisation of ADP, lottery operator Francaise des Jeux and for a reduction in France's stake in utility Engie.
