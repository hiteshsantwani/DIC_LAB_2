PARIS — Two of France's richest men, long locked in a very public rivalry, are once again pitted against each other — this time over flashy and competing donations to rebuild Notre Dame.
Billionaire luxury tycoons — Bernard Arnault, 70, and Francois Pinault, 82 — are among France's fiercest business competitors and patrons.
On Tuesday, their rivalry reached dramatic heights when it was announced Pinault, his son and their company Artemis would immediately donate 100 million euros ($113 million) to help finance renovations to Notre Dame after it was seriously damaged in an inferno during building works.
Hours later, Arnault shot back with an announcement that he, his family and his luxury company LVMH would pledge double that amount — 200 million euros ($226 million) — for the restoration of the church that was immortalized in Victor Hugo's 1831 novel "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" — an eternal story of obsession and jealousy.
