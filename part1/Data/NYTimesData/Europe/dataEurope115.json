Both camps, though, were weakened by internal division. The Cairo-based Arab League has been reduced to little more than a talking shop, and the Europeans are squabbling over how to handle illegal migration, even if migration has fallen to a seven-year low.
Not every Arab country sent its leader. The Europeans prevented President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court on genocide charges, from attending.
Saudi Arabia was represented by King Salman, 83, on his first foreign trip in 16 months, an interval that heightened speculation that his health or his mental capacities were declining.
Those suspicions intensified during the king’s address to the summit, when he lost his place in his text, fumbling for 16 seconds and asking an aide about what he had already read, according to a live broadcast of the remarks. He continued, as the other delegations sat stone-faced, but fumbled again a minute later.
Mr. el-Sisi, though, visibly basked in the spotlight of his diplomatic triumph. One newspaper on Monday featured a full-length photo of Mr. el-Sisi surrounded by European and Arab leaders. In a speech on Sunday, he warned that terrorism was spreading like a “cursed plague.”
His counterterrorism tactics are under heightened scrutiny since the execution on Wednesday of nine people convicted of the killing of Hisham Barakat, Egypt’s chief prosecutor, in a bomb attack in 2015. Human rights groups said the men’s confessions had been extracted under torture and their trials were deeply flawed.
Mr. el-Sisi defended the executions on Monday. “When a human being is killed in a terrorist act, the families tell me that we want the right of our children and their blood,” he told reporters. “This culture exists in the region and that right must be given through the law.”
