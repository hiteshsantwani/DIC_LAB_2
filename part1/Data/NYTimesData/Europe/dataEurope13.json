DUBROVNIK, Croatia â€” China's prime minister promised Friday that his government will respect European standards and fair trade, seeking to allay concerns that it is flouting European Union competition rules with huge investments on the continent.
Opening an annual summit between Eastern and Central European nations and China, Li Keqiang said "we intend to fully respect European standards."
The Chinese government has also been criticized for failing to give reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
"We welcome openness and we want to treat all companies that operate in China equally and to increase imports from the (European) countries," he said through an interpreter. "China is open to the world...we welcome the two-way openness."
