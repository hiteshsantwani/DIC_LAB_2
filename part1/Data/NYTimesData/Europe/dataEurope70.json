(Reuters) - European shares eased from eight-month highs on Wednesday, weighed down by healthcare and mining stocks while investors looked past better-than-expected first-quarter economic growth in China.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.2 percent by 0930 GMT after five straight days of gains. All country indexes were flat to higher except London FTSE 100.
China's economy unexpectedly steadied in the first quarter, defying expectations for a further slowdown, as industrial production jumped sharply and consumer demand showed signs of improvement.
Analysts said it was too early to call a sustainable turnaround there, and further policy support would be needed to maintain momentum.
