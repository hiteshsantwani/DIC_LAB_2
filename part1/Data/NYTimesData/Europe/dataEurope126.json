“We now have a strong, common understanding of how to approach Russia,” Mr. Stoltenberg said. “Those allies who were skeptical of dialogue with Russia have seen that we have delivered on deterrence and defense.”
The gatherings to commemorate NATO’s anniversary were originally planned as a week of events in Washington for heads of state and government. But Mr. Trump’s angry speeches, public and private, at other alliance gatherings over the last two years persuaded allies to downgrade the anniversary celebration to a meeting of foreign ministers.
The goal, according to current and former American and European officials, was to limit Mr. Trump’s participation.
Even Tuesday’s meeting with Mr. Trump was not originally on Mr. Stoltenberg’s agenda. But then Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she had invited the NATO chief to address Congress, a speech that is scheduled for Wednesday.
European officials said Mr. Stoltenberg had not yet accepted the invitation when Ms. Pelosi announced it. That put him in the position of potentially leaving Washington without seeing the president but addressing the Democrat-led House, which has approved a measure that seeks to block Mr. Trump from withdrawing from the military alliance.
Last week, NATO made the unusual move of extending Mr. Stoltenberg’s term a second time, by two more years, meaning he would leave office in 2022. It is an acknowledgment of Mr. Stoltenberg’s deft touch not just with Mr. Trump, but also with other difficult alliance leaders, including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary.
Mr. Trump endorsed the extension on Tuesday. “I had no doubt in my mind who I wanted,” he said.
European officials said their worries about Mr. Stoltenberg’s cozy relationship with Mr. Trump were pushed aside, largely to avoid giving the president an outsize role in selecting a new NATO leader. Mr. Stoltenberg was scheduled to step down in 2020, at the height of an intense election in the United States.
