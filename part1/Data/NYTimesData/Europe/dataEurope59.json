STRASBOURG/MOSCOW â€” The European Court of Human Rights ruled on Tuesday that Russia violated the rights of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny by placing him under house arrest in 2014 and imposing other restrictive measures on him.
Navalny was held under house arrest for 10 months from February 2014 while he and his brother Oleg were investigated for embezzlement in a case that his supporters called politically motivated.
The court in Strasbourg said in a judgment that the house-arrest order had not been justified and that tough restrictions on him communicating with the outside world had been out of proportion with the criminal charges he faced.
It said it was "apparent he had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities" and ordered Russia to pay him over 22,000 euros for damages and expenses.
