LISBON â€” Plans to reform and possible expand European club competition ran into opposition on Friday as the continent's leagues declared they were 'united' in their determination to protect domestic football.
The European Leagues umbrella group said it would take a more active role in influencing public opinion and shaping the future of football on the continent and reiterated its claim that fans prefer domestic league action to UEFA competition.
Meanwhile, the English Premier League, one of the European Leagues' 35 members, said its 20 clubs would "vigorously defend" it against any plans to impose a new calendar.
UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said on being re-elected in February that he would work with the European Club Association (ECA), which groups 232 of the region's biggest clubs, to "design the club competitions of the future."
