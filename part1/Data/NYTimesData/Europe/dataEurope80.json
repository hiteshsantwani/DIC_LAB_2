FRANKFURT â€” Europe's banking sector is overcrowded and in significant need of consolidation, ECB President Mario Draghi said on Wednesday.
The sector needs to take a series of actions to improve its business model, he told a post-policy-meeting news conference.
"That can be achieved however only through consolidation.... (and) the need for consolidation is very, very significant," he said.
"There is a relationship between scale and the capacity to undertake the investments that are needed to improve technology and be competitive, especially in certain business models."
