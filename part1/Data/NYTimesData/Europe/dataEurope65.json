ZURICH â€” The head of UBS Europe SE, Thomas Rodermann, will leave the bank when his contract expires at the end of November, UBS Group said on Monday.
Switzerland's biggest bank gave no reason for the departure, which it said in a statement was by mutual consent.
It declined to comment on a report in German newspaper Handelsblatt, which said the 54-year-old Rodermann was leaving after a turf war with Christine Novakovic, the Zurich-based head of wealth management for UBS's Europe, Middle East and Africa region.
Rodermann joined what was then UBS Deutschland AG as management board head in 2015 and has been in charge since, restructuring the Frankfurt-based business and expanding its wealth management arm.
