(Reuters) - European shares gained for the fifth day on Tuesday, bolstered by bank and retails stocks while data out of China added to hopes of stabilisation in the world's second-largest economy.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index gained 0.2 percent by 0928 GMT led by Germany's DAX 0.6 percent rise while Spanish and Italian bourses were flat to modestly lower.
Also encouraging investors was a ZEW survey showing the mood among German investors improved in April, as the growth outlook for Europe's largest economy brightened amid a resilient global economy and a delay to Britain's departure from the EU.
Zalando jumped more than 10 percent, making it the top performer on the STOXX and pushing the retail sector 0.7 percent higher after the e-commerce company said it expected to post an operating profit for the first quarter.
