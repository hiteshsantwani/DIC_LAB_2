(Reuters) - European shares rounded off a solid week on Friday, as better than expected German and U.S. data bolstered risk appetite, while Irish stocks surged to their best closing level in nearly half a year amid a possible delay to Brexit.
Hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal also aided sentiment.
Data showed a narrower French trade deficit and a rise in German industrial output in February, while U.S. employment in March accelerated from a 17-month low.
The pan-region STOXX 600 index edged up 0.1 percent, as most bourses across Europe rose.
"We are in a Goldilocks scenario, where bad news is good news, and the good news is good," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at TF Global Markets in London. "The U.S. jobs number was solid and this has pushed the European markets higher."
The STOXX 600 perked up after the data to briefly touch levels last seen in August.
Guy Foster, head of research at Brewin Dolphin, said the equity rally "does have legs".
