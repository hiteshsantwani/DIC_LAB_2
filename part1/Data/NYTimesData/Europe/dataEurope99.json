In early January, the National Assembly labeled Mr. Maduro an illegitimate “usurper,” and on Jan. 23, Mr. Guaidó, the leader of the assembly, had himself sworn in as interim president.
A group of European countries had given Mr. Maduro until midnight Sunday to schedule a new, free and fair presidential election, and several explicitly warned that they would withdraw recognition if he did not. Mr. Maduro refused to order the new elections, and on Monday, the European countries followed through on the threat.
“Venezuelans have the right to express themselves freely and democratically,” President Emmanuel Macron of France wrote on Twitter, adding that his government recognized Mr. Guaidó as “president in charge,” to carry out elections.
The British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said on Twitter that Mr. Guaidó was being acknowledged as “interim constitutional president until credible elections can be held.”
