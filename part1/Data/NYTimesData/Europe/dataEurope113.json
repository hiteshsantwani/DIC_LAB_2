“I’d like to imagine that it will end, because a lot of families are waiting,” said Veronika Pugachova, 37, a history teacher whose husband is serving on the front.
She worries about him, not least because her brother-in-law, also a soldier, was killed in the conflict in 2015. “I try to believe that when there’s a new government, in some way all of these issues will be dealt with,” Ms. Pugachova said.
“We’re all patriots and I’m very proud of my husband,” she said. “Of course it’s hard, it’s hard to wait, because when he leaves it’s not for less than six months. Of course it’s hard. We believe in him, we support him, our whole family does.”
In this election Mr. Poroshenko is seeking a second, five-year term. If no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote on March 31 — which polls show is very likely — an April runoff will decide the winner.
Mr. Poroshenko is running on his record of overhauling the army and winning independence from Moscow for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, saying he provided a calm harbor of faith in a turbulent country.
