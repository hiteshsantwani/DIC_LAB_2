(Reuters) - European shares ground higher on Thursday, buoyed by gains among bank and travel stocks, with risk appetite aided by a European Central Bank official expressing willingness to support the euro zone.
French central bank head Francois Villeroy de Galhau said that the euro zone was not in the situation of Japan and that the ECB was "not short of ammunition" to accelerate price growth and buoy the economy.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index edged up 0.1 percent, with Paris-traded shares rising 0.7 percent as luxury stocks gained significantly.
LVMH's shares rose 4.6 percent to a record closing high after the Louis Vuitton owner posted strong first-quarter sales.
