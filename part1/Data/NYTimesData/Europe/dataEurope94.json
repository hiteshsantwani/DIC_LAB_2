NEW YORK â€” A gauge of global stocks fell on Thursday after underwhelming manufacturing surveys from Asia and Europe, though it pared losses as Wall Street edged higher on strong U.S. retail sales data and earnings from industrial companies.
The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index inched forward on strong March retail sales data, which registered their greatest increase in 1-1/2 years, and upbeat results from Union Pacific Corp and Honeywell International Inc.
"The retail sales number was very strong," said Jeffrey Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments in New York. "It puts to rest the recession fear."
The MSCI All-Country World Index fell 0.1% but came off session lows to tick just above last Friday's closing level.
