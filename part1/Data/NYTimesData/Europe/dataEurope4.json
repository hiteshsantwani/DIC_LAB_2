United States citizens wishing to visit or travel to the majority of the European Union nations after January 2021 will have to register online and pay a small fee as part of a new security system intended to screen visa-free travelers.
What’s changing?
Starting on Jan. 1, 2021, American citizens will have to register online, through the new European Travel Information and Authorization System, to enter any of the 26 Schengen-area countries, plus four countries currently in the process of joining the area, regardless of the duration of their visit or the number of coun tries visited. The European Council adopted the policy in September 2018.
What’s the current process?
American citizens traveling to these 26 countries for stays of less than 90 days do not require visas or travel authorization.
Is it a visa?
E.T.I.A.S. registration is not a visa, according to the European Union. Americans will not be required to visit a consulate to file any kind of application, fingerprinting is not required, and less information will be asked than is expected of visa applicants.
