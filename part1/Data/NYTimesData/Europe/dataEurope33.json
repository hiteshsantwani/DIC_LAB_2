BUDAPEST â€” A group of Hungarian business leaders and politicians close to Prime Minister Viktor Orban have founded an international news agency in London whose coverage will focus on central and eastern Europe.
Orban's associates have gained control over a large chunk of the Hungarian media in recent years and his Fidesz party has taken total control of state media, drawing international accusations that they are weakening freedom of speech.
However, Orban has been unable to control international news coverage, which has been far more critical of him than local media. The new agency's early content suggests it is more sympathetic to him.
The new company, called V4NA, was registered in London by Hungary's ambassador to the UK, Kristof Szalay-Bobrovniczky, on Dec. 31, 2018, according to company filings.
