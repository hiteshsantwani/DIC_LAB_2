WASHINGTON — The United States and the European Union are preparing to impose tit-for-tat tariffs on each other’s products, the latest escalation in a 14-year fight over government aid given to Boeing and European rival Airbus.
“The World Trade Organization finds that the European Union subsidies to Airbus has adversely impacted the United States, which will now put Tariffs on $11 Billion of E.U. products!” President Trump said in a tweet on Tuesday morning. “The E.U. has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade for many years. It will soon stop!”
The office of the United States trade representative said on Monday night that it was preparing a list of European products to tax as retaliation for European subsidies to Airbus, which the World Trade Organization ruled were illegal in May 2018. That prompted the European Union to announce that it was also readying a list of tariffs to counter American subsidies to Boeing.
The moves come amid tense trade relations between the United States and Europe, which are engaged in a battle of tariffs after Mr. Trump’s decision last year to tax European steel and aluminum. Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs on European cars and car parts if the European Union does not agree to better trade terms for American products, and Europe has said it will retaliate on American goods if Mr. Trump follows through on that threat.
