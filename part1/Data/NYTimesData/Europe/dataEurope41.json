LONDON â€” Shares of European chipmakers fell sharply on Wednesday after German silicon wafer maker Siltronic warned of a "significantly" weaker second quarter in the latest setback for a sector reeling from slowing smartphone demand.
Pointing to economic slowdown, geopolitical uncertainties and continuing inventory corrections, Siltronic said the timing of a market rebound is "not visible".
Siltronic shares fell as much as 9 percent on the STOXX 600, giving up most of their gains from a recent rally on optimism over a potential U.S.-China trade deal.
By 1449 GMT the shares were down 5.3 percent, set for their worst day since Feb. 21.
That cast a shadow over other European semiconductor companies, with AMS registering a 6.2 percent retreat and Dialog Semiconductor dipping by 0.3 percent.
