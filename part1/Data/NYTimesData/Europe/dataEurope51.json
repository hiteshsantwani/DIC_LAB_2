(Reuters) - Most European stocks slid on Monday amid losses across most sectors, with German bank and real estate shares drawing investor attention as did European suppliers of U.S. planemaker Boeing following a production cut announced late on Friday.
The pan-region STOXX 600 index fell 0.2 percent, further distancing itself from a near eight-month peak hit last week.
"In light of the strong rally and the multi-month highs that were achieved in European indices recently, some investors are now taking a breather," David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets UK, wrote in a note.
Bank stocks dropped 0.4 percent, with German lender Commerzbank among the top losers on the sector index with a 2.4 percent fall. Deutsche Bank, with whom Commerzbank is exploring a merger, dropped 1.9 percent.
