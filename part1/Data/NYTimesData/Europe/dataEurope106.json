LONDON — With Britain’s fate in the hands of the European Union it wants to leave, Prime Minister Theresa May shuttled between Berlin and Paris on Tuesday to plead for more time to salvage her faltering withdrawal plans.
European leaders have indicated that they are willing to push back the date for Britain’s withdrawal from the bloc, most likely until the end of the year. But they are insisting that Mrs. May explain how she would put that time to constructive use.
That may be complicated for the prime minister. Back home, her Parliament is deadlocked over withdrawal, the political parties are split, and talks between the government and the opposition on a compromise plan are making minimal progress.
So ahead of a summit meeting in Brussels on Wednesday at which European Union leaders will decide what to do, Mrs. May embarked on some last-minute diplomacy. Her goal was to reduce the risk of the summit ending in a “no deal” Brexit on April 12, the current deadline, which could have serious economic consequences.
