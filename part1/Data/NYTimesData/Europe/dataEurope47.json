DEMOCRACY AND DICTATORSHIP IN EUROPE
From the Ancien Régime to the Present Day
By Sheri Berman
Far-right nationalists are now in power in Poland and Hungary, in coalition governments in Italy and Austria, and in parliaments in Germany, the Netherlands and France. In anticipation of European Union elections next month, a group of far-right populist parties has formed a new alliance, led by Italy’s Instagram-loving interior minister, Matteo Salvini. How surprised should supporters of liberal democracy in Europe be? Not very, according to Sheri Berman’s “Democracy and Dictatorship in Europe: From the Ancien Régime to the Present Day.”
In her study of European political development over more than 200 years, Berman, a professor of political science at Barnard, shows that the story of democracy in Europe is complicated. The ultimate goal, she believes, is liberal democracy, with elections, respect for the rule of law, individual liberties and minority rights. But that’s a rare, and hard-won, achievement. A step forward is often followed by a step back.
