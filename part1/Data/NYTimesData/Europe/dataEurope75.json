PARIS â€” Europe needs to decide on a digital tax and should lead the way if there is insufficient consensus globally, the EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, said on Monday.
There is still disagreement among EU members over how to implement a so-called "GAFA tax" - named after Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon - to ensure the global internet giants pay a fair share of taxes on their massive business operations in Europe.
France has been driving hard for such a tax, but at a meeting of EU finance meetings over the weekend, Sweden, Finland, Ireland and Denmark blocked a draft EU-wide GAFA tax proposal, officials said.
"We are becoming an increasingly digital world and it will be a huge problem if we do not find a way to raise (digital) taxes," Vestager told France Inter radio.
