Some hope that will change after the election.
"Leaving a strong group to join a weak group is a difficult political decision, but leaving to join a group that is also quite strong and growing is less so," said Ryszard Legutko, a PiS lawmaker and co-chair of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group.
"It is the first time there's a real chance things might change, that this political, even ideological monopoly can be somehow undermined," Legutko said.
IN FROM THE COLD
Links among the far-right remain largely limited to personal relationships. When leaders who have long been isolated at home and lack influence abroad attend each other's rallies, it is about showing they are not marginal.
"It is about validating one another," said Duncan McDonnell, Professor of Politics in the School of Government and International Relations at Griffith University. But he said the far-right increasingly saw itself as "part of a new wave".
The Alternative for Germany (AfD) could win many more seats in the next European Parliament, opinion polls show, and might throw its hat in with Salvini's ENF group. The polls show the Forum for Democracy (FvD) in the Netherlands, led by Thierry Baudet, could win four new seats in the EU assembly and it has said it will join Poland's PiS in the ECR.
Spanish newcomer Vox has become the darling of eurosceptic groups following its success in a regional election last December in Spain, which until then had been resistant to the populist currents sweeping Europe.
Vox is now being courted by both by Poland's PiS and Salvini's League. But looking ahead to the next European Parliament - where polls suggest Vox will win about five seats, up from none today -- Vox leader Santiago Abascal told Reuters: "It may be that we'll be alone."
