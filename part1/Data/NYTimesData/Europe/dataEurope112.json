LONDON — Pep Guardiola clasped his hands to his head, a look of sheer exasperation on his face. Even that, though, did not feel sufficient, not after one of his players had given the ball away so carelessly. And so the Manchester City manager hurled himself to the ground, curled over in his cable-knit sweater, and beat the turf with his fists.
By the time he had picked himself up, the danger had passed, but that was not the point. Guardiola seeks perfection; there are times when he takes anything less as a personal slight. He frantically waved to the culprit, Ilkay Gündogan, to grab his attention. In the tumult of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Tuesday, he had to resort to mime.
Two hands, palms flat, raised: What, exactly, was that?
Two fingers, pointed to the temples: Think.
Watching Guardiola on the touchline is exhausting. Few managers seem to become so absorbed in a game, so consumed by it. He moves constantly, restlessly — pacing and jittering and signaling, bellowing instructions and calling players over for brief conclaves and turning on his heel to consult with his bench.
After a while, once the movements are decoded, it is almost possible to tell how Manchester City is playing simply by watching Guardiola, a cross between a telegraph service and an interpretive dance troupe.
