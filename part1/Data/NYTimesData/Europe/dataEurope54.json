BERLIN â€” Shares in Zalando jumped on Tuesday after Europe's biggest online-only fashion retailer said it expected to post an operating profit for the first quarter, when it usually makes a loss due to selling off remaining stock after Christmas at a discount.
The shares were up 11.7 percent by 0924 GMT, buoying other fashion firms like ASOS, Zara-owner Inditex, Adidas and H&M.
The industry has been plagued in recent years by fierce competition and heavy discounting, while investment in logistics and technology to speed online delivery has also weighed on profitability, especially as Amazon expands in fashion.
Zalando said late on Monday it expected adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in the single-digit millions, while analysts had predicted an operating loss. It said sales growth should meet market expectations for about 23 percent.
