TOKYO — Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance plans to invest in higher-yielding bonds of European government agencies this fiscal year, especially as a dovish monetary policy tilt in many economies has cut returns from foreign sovereign debt.
Fukoku, which had 6.63 trillion yen (£45.25 billion) in total assets as of March, expects to reduce investments in open foreign bonds, or foreign bonds without currency hedging, as there is a risk of the yen strengthening, Yusuke Onodera, general manager of investment planning at Fukoku, told Reuters in an interview.
Last year, as yields on U.S. government debt rose and hedging costs spiked, the insurer bought foreign bonds without hedging. But as yields started falling this year, the insurer has begun hedging a part of its open foreign bond assets.
"As more than 30 percent of our assets are foreign-denominated assets, we are at a point where we need to prepare for a risk of the rising yen," Onodera said.
