“If an airline is able to put you on a connecting flight or another nonstop flight under the threshold, then technically they don’t owe you anything,” said Jamie Larounis, founder of travel blog The Forward Cabin.
Here’s what you should know:
How can I file a claim for compensation?
First, it’s helpful to know that the type of compensation you can receive depends on the nature of your delay or cancellation. If your flight was delayed by fewer than three hours, then you aren’t covered under the rule. Also, if your flight was delayed or canceled for “extraordinary circumstances,” like severe weather or political unrest, then it isn’t covered either.
Airlines generally have flight compensation information located on their websites (though you may have to look closely to find it). The airlines, according to the legislation, are required to inform passengers of their rights.
When you file the claim with your airline or through a watchdog agency such as FlightRight, you will be asked to provide your flight number and booking reference, as well as information about why your flight was delayed or canceled, so it’s helpful to have that information handy.
Does the regulation apply only to airlines with headquarters in E.U. countries?
To be eligible for compensation, your flight must be on an E.U. airline only if you’re flying into an E.U. country. But if your flight originated in, or if you’re traveling within, the E.U., then you are also covered under the regulation regardless of the airline.
