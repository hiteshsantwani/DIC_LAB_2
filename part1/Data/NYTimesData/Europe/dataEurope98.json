Malta said Saturday that four European Union nations would accept 64 migrants rescued at sea off Libya 10 days ago.
In a statement, Malta’s government said that the migrants will be sent to Germany, France, Portugal and Luxembourg. The migrants are being transferred to Maltese vessels and brought to port after days of uncertainty.
However, Malta said the German-flagged aid ship, named Alan Kurdi after a young Syrian boy who drowned during the crossing from Turkey to Greece in 2015, will not be allowed to enter its ports, and none of the migrants will remain in Malta.
“Once again, the smallest member of the European Union was put under unnecessary pressure, being asked to resolve a case which was neither its responsibility nor its remit,” the government said. “A solution was found in order not to let the situation deteriorate further while making it clear Malta cannot keep shouldering this burden.”
