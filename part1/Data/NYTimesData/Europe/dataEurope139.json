The British Parliament’s long-anticipated vote on a plan to withdraw from the European Union — also known as Brexit — came to its expected conclusion on Tuesday night when lawmakers weighed in on a deal proposed by Prime Minister Theresa May.
No one really thought that at the last minute Mrs. May would be able to pull a rabbit out of her hat to secure approval for the plan. And she didn’t, with her Brexit deal rejected by a vote of 432 to 202. Now she has to go hat in hand to Brussels to see if she can work some magic there.
Spoiler alert: She almost certainly cannot.
Here’s what to know as Britain enters uncharted territory of the process that is Brexit.
The opposition has called a vote of no confidence.
