What to watch in the leading soccer leagues in Europe this weekend:
ITALY
Aiming to quickly move on from its Champions League elimination, Juventus needs only a draw at home against Fiorentina on Saturday to clinch a record-extending eighth straight Serie A title.
Juventus is 17 points ahead of second-place Napoli with six rounds remaining and the Bianconeri also hold the tiebreaker over their southern rival with a better head-to-head record.
However, Juventus took a major psychological hit when it was beaten by a more inexperienced Ajax team on Tuesday.
Forward Paulo Dybala is out for up to two weeks after picking up a muscle injury against Ajax, but Cristiano Ronaldo likely won't be rested again after sitting out a loss at Spal last weekend â€” when Juventus wasted a chance to clinch.
