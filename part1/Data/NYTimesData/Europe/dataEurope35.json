LONDON — Ford said Thursday that it would cut thousands of jobs across Europe as it struggles to reduce costs while tougher emissions rules and declining demand are hurting profits.
The company, which has 68,000 workers in Europe, including through joint ventures, did not specify how many jobs it would shed, but a spokesman said the number would be in the “thousands.” Ford said that it planned to consult with labor unions about the cuts, which will affect all departments, and that it hoped that as many as possible would be voluntary.
The carmaker also said it would close a transmission factory in Bordeaux, France, at the end of August. Among the possible cuts, Ford is: considering ceasing production of two minivan models at its factory in Saarlouis, Germany, as the European market for such vehicles shrinks; reviewing a joint venture in Russia, Ford Sollers; and planning to consolidate its headquarters in Britain.
The global auto industry is showing signs of strain. Car sales in the United States appear to have peaked, as incentives like low-interest loans end. Officials in China said this week that car sales there plummeted 19 percent in December, the steepest decline in modern record-keeping that coincides with a broader slowdown of the Chinese economy. In Europe, automakers are grappling with various challenges, including Britain’s looming exit from the European Union, which could result in higher tariffs on cars and car parts.
