But interviews with over a dozen workers revealed a deep-seated disillusionment with the recovery and the quality of jobs emerging from it.
The changes in labor laws weakened job protections as well as earnings. With millions looking for work, employers could offer lower salaries, making it harder for people to regain or maintain living standards.
Mrs. Navarro and her husband were among the better off. With degrees in law, management and business, she owned the events promotion company, employing around 50 people on and off for projects.
In 2006, some of her clients suddenly stopped paying. Two years later, as the financial crisis hit, she had to close shop. She found a managerial job at a nonprofit foundation that paid €2,500 a month, less than before but enough to help maintain the family’s lifestyle.
Then the foundation went under in 2012 — the same year the labor legislation went into force. Mrs. Navarro could not find a new job. Because the foundation had required her to register as self-employed, a tactic that allows employers to avoid paying high social taxes, she received no unemployment compensation.
Her husband lost his job the same year and collected unemployment benefits as he looked for work. He eventually took over a charcuterie stand once owned by Mrs. Navarro’s father in a dimly lit produce market, becoming self-employed. But his sales are down because other Spaniards, too, are economizing. Mr. Alvarez now earns €1,000 a month but, after taxes and social security, takes home only about a third of that.
