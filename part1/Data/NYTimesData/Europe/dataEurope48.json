JOHANNESBURG â€” Sudan-born billionaire Mo Ibrahim says the migration of Africans to Europe and North America should be viewed as a positive phenomenon, not a threat.
Experts said during a conference hosted by Ibrahim's foundation that Africans make up about 14% of the global migrant population, a much smaller share than the 41% from Asia and 23% from Europe.
The conference in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, ended Sunday.
Ibrahim said in an interview that statistics also show that Europe isn't being flooded with Africans because 70% of African migrants remain on the continent.
The 72-year-old philanthropist earned his fortune by establishing the Celtel mobile phone network across Africa. He now lives in Britain.
