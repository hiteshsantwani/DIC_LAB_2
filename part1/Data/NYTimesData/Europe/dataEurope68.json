MELBOURNE â€” England coach Eddie Jones has ruled himself out of replacing Australia boss Michael Cheika after the Rugby World Cup, saying the Wallabies need a "generational change" in culture, local media reported on Friday.
Jones, who guided the Wallabies to the 2003 World Cup final before his acrimonious departure two years later, is reported to be on Rugby Australia's (RA) short-list of candidates.
Cheika has said he would quit if Australia failed to win the Sept. 20-Nov. 2 World Cup in Japan.
"I am happy in Europe," Jones told the Sydney Morning Herald.
"The Wallabies need a generational change in culture."
Australia, ranked sixth in the world, won only four of 13 tests in 2018, their worst season in decades.
