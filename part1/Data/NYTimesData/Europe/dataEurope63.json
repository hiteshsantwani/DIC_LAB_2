PARIS — France's Credit Agricole and Spain's Santander plan to combine their custody and asset servicing operations, in a deal that could point the way for European banks to achieve scale without the complexity of a full merger.
The new business will have around $3.8 trillion (£2.9 trillion) of assets under custody, closing the gap on European leaders and providing scope for savings and cost reductions.
Banks' custodian services departments look after assets for clients in return for fees. But it is often a low margin business and growing competition is making scale more important.
Credit Agricole will own 69.5 percent of the merged unit, which will keep the brand name of Agricole's existing asset management arm - Caceis. Santander will hold 30.5 percent.
