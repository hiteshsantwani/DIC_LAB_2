FRANKFURT â€” Europe is facing yet another make-or-break week.
With an emergency EU summit over Brexit and an ECB policy meeting on the agenda, officials will be under pressure to take decisive steps to soothe concerns ahead of a set-piece gathering of the global financial elite in Washington.
But the temptation will be great to stick with the bloc's rich tradition of just kicking the can down the road.
The deadline for Britain to leave the EU, seen as set in stone just days ago, is again in flux as both sides are openly discussing an extension, even if that means Britain must cross another red line by participating in May's European elections.
The apparent softening of British Prime Minister Theresa May's position suggests the end game is far from imminent.
