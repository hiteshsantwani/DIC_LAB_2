(Reuters) - European shares rose slightly on Wednesday as gains across most sectors offset losses among lenders, which were hit by a lack of detail in European Central Bank (ECB) comments after the bank left borrowing costs unchanged.
The ECB's decision on rates matched investors' expectations but President Mario Draghi's comments shed very little light on reported plans for a tiered deposit rate and a new round of ultra-cheap bank loans.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.3 percent, although sentiment was capped by threats made by the United States earlier this week to slap tariffs on European Union-made goods.
Banks, which were broadly boosted some weeks ago on reports of a planned ECB tiered deposit rate, dropped 0.3 percent as investors failed to get details on this from Draghi.
