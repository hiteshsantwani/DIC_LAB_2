SARAJEVO â€” Bosnia will not send representatives to the Council of Europe's assembly this year, because the country's rival ethnic groups have failed to form a government or to nominate delegates, a minister said on Tuesday.
European officials warned Bosnia's new central parliament last week it had to nominate representatives to the Council's assembly by Sunday. But parliament, which does not have a clear ruling majority, failed to convene.
Under the Council of Europe rules, member countries must appoint their new delegations within six months of their latest election. Otherwise, they face an interim suspension.
"This failure has inflicted great damage to the international reputation of Bosnia-Herzegovina ... at the time when we make major efforts toward European Union integration," Foreign Minister Igor Crnadak said at a news conference.
