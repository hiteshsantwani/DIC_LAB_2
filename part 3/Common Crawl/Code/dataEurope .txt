DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) — China\'s prime minister has promised that Beijing will respect European standards and fair trade, seeking to allay concerns that it\'s flouting EU competition rules with huge investments on the continent.
Opening an annual summit of Eastern and Central European nations and China, Li Keqiang said "we intend to fully respect European standards."
Beijing has also been criticized for failing to give reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
He adds "we welcome openness and we want to treat all companies that operate in China equally and to increase imports from the (European) countries."
EU member Croatia is hosting a two-day summit between China and 16 regional countries on expanding business between China and the region, dubbed 16+1.


European court: Russia\'s house arrest of Navalny unlawful
MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights ruled Tuesday that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
Navalny, a prominent opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed the ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities. It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 20,000 euros ($22,550) in damages.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict to the court\'s highest chamber.
It\'s the second time that the court has ruled against Russia in a matter of months. Last November, the court\'s highest chamber found that Russian authorities violated multiple human rights in detaining Navalny seven times from 2012 to 2014, and that two of the arrests were expressly aimed at "suppressing political pluralism."
It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 63,000 euros in damages, and called on Russia to fix legislation to "take due regard of the fundamental importance of the right to peaceful assembly."
Russia is obliged to carry out the court\'s rulings, which enforce the European Convention on Human Rights, but it has delayed implementing past rulings from the court and argued against them as encroaching on Russian judicial sovereignty.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Construction of infrastructure such as power plants, mobile networks and bridges is booming throughout cash-strapped countries in central and eastern Europe thanks to Chinese funding, which has the European Union scrambling to counter Beijing\'s mounting influence.
Croatia is hosting a summit on Thursday for 16 European countries with developing economies and China. The gathering in Dubrovnik focuses on expanding business and other links between China and a region it sees as a gateway to Europe.
The countries that endorsed China\'s global "Belt and Road" initiative already have seen billions of dollars in investments. Eleven are EU members.
Western leaders worry economic weight could give China political muscle in the region, and about projects funded with Chinese investments adhering to lower environmental and other standards than the EU\'s.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has left its policy promises and interest rates unchanged as it weighs looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
The ECB has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve in pausing the withdrawal of stimulus measures deployed over a decade to bounce back from the global financial crisis, as central bankers around the world ponder which way the economy is headed. The Fed has already started raising rates but has backed off plans for further rate increases in 2019.
The ECB\'s 25-member governing council was content to stand pat on Thursday, making no changes to its short policy statement. The bank took several steps to support the economy on March 7. Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.
The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4%, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year — if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3% for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8% from a peak of 12.1% in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3% from 3.5%.
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.

Ledecky heads pro swim league set to debut in US, Europe

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A new professional league for elite swimmers will debut this year with U.S. and foreign teams competing in a mixed gender format with the athletes being paid.
Five-time Olympic champion Katie Ledecky will compete for one of the International Swimming League\'s eight teams — four based in the U.S. and four in Europe.
Ledecky said the league "represents a new era for professional swimming."
"Especially for competitive women like me," she said Tuesday. "Jumping in the pool for the ISL really means a new era for women since it\'s one of the first leagues to emphasize gender equality as one of its values."
Besides Ledecky, fellow Americans Nathan Adrian, Simone Manuel and Ryan Murphy have been tabbed as ambassadors. They\'re expected to both compete and help promote the inaugural season.
The ISL won\'t begin until after this summer\'s world championships in South Korea, while a planned 2020 season would start after the Tokyo Olympics.
Founded by Ukrainian financier Konstantin Grigorishin, the league will launch Oct. 4-5, with meets held nearly every weekend through Nov. 24. The league championship will be in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay in a temporary pool on Dec. 20-21. The racing will be in short-course meters rather than the long-course format used in the Olympics.

"The show that is going to go around it will be quite a production, very fan-oriented," former Olympic medalist Kaitlin Sandeno said.
The U.S. will be represented by: the New York Breakers, the Los Angeles Current, the DC Trident, and the Cali Condors based in San Francisco.
The Breakers will be overseen by general manager Tina Andrew, mother and manager of swimmer Michael Andrew. The Current will be led by retired Olympic backstroke champion Lenny Krayzelburg, the Condors by retired four-time Olympic champion Jason Lezak, and the Trident by Sandeno.
The European teams will be based in London, Rome, Budapest and likely France.
Full rosters will be announced in the coming weeks.
Swimmers will compete for team points in various styles of races, with 12 men and 12 women on each team. The ISL said numerous Olympic champions and world record holders will participate.
"There\'s something about competing for a team title," five-time Olympic champion Adrian said. "It\'s a different kind of energy than what swimmers are used to."
The ISL will have a zero tolerance doping policy and won\'t allow any swimmer with a previous doping violation to participate.
Swimmers will sign two contracts: one with their team and another with the ISL. Revenue will flow from the clubs and the league to the athletes. Grigorishin said revenue will be split 50-50 between the league and swimmers.
"We have one of the hardest working athletes in the sports world and they deserve more than we have gotten so far," Krayzelburg said. "It\'s going to change the landscape, create more exposure and opportunities for our athletes and put the sport of swimming on the forefront, not just in the Olympic year."
Currently, professional swimmers have the TYR Pro Swim Series in the U.S. and the FINA World Cup between August and November in Europe, Asia and the Middle East in which they compete for prize money.
The ISL has overcome roadblocks to its formation, having filed a federal antitrust lawsuit last year against FINA, the sport\'s international governing body.
FINA announced its own Champions Swim Series made up of invitation-only meets in Guangzhou, Budapest and Indianapolis in April and May. Total prize money is $3.9 million and the competitions will include some of the sport\'s biggest names.
"We have no principle conflict with FINA," Grigorishin said. "FINA should be responsible for the whole swimming world. The league is just for the elite swimmers. Somebody has to regulate and set up the rules in swimming. If you are a regulator, you should not be organizer of competition. In the future, FINA will have to make a choice."
Grigorishin said negotiations with global broadcasting outlets are ongoing.

BERLIN (AP) — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."


European researchers to drill for ancient Antarctic ice
BERLIN (AP) — A group of 14 European scientific institutions plan to retrieve the world\'s oldest ice as part of research into past climate change.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
The consortium led by the Germany-based Alfred Wegener Institute said Tuesday it has identified an area in Antarctica, nicknamed "Little Dome C," that should harbor ice as old as 1.5 million years.
So-called ice core measurements are crucial for scientists\' understanding of past climatic changes on Earth and the models they use to predict future global warming or cooling.
Current ice core measurements provide reliable data going back only about 800,000 years.
At a meeting in Vienna, the institutes said they spent the past three years working with American, Australian, Japanese and Russian colleagues using radar to determine the best possible site for drilling.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.

1:50 p.m.
The European Central Bank has kept its policy promises, interest rates and stimulus settings unchanged as officials weigh looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a news conference Thursday, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more monetary stimulus in coming months. Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for an interest rate increase from the end of the year into next year.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."

BERLIN (AP) — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.

European court: Russia\'s house arrest of Navalny unlawful
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
Navalny, a leading opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed Tuesday\'s ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled Tuesday that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict.

DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) — China\'s prime minister has promised that Beijing will respect European standards and fair trade, seeking to allay concerns that it\'s flouting EU competition rules with huge investments on the continent.
Opening an annual summit of Eastern and Central European nations and China, Li Keqiang said "we intend to fully respect European standards."
Beijing has also been criticized for failing to give reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
He adds "we welcome openness and we want to treat all companies that operate in China equally and to increase imports from the (European) countries."
EU member Croatia is hosting a two-day summit between China and 16 regional countries on expanding business between China and the region, dubbed 16+1.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members — or those hoping to join — could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.
Of the 16 participating countries — Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia — 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has left its policy promises and interest rates unchanged as it weighs looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
The ECB has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve in pausing the withdrawal of stimulus measures deployed over a decade to bounce back from the global financial crisis, as central bankers around the world ponder which way the economy is headed. The Fed has already started raising rates but has backed off plans for further rate increases in 2019.
The ECB\'s 25-member governing council was content to stand pat on Thursday, making no changes to its short policy statement. The bank took several steps to support the economy on March 7. Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.
The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4 percent, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year — if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3 percent for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8 percent from a peak of 12.1 percent in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3 percent from 3.5 percent.
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.

Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
\t
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
\t
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.
\t
The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4%, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
\t
\t
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
\t
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year — if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3% for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8% from a peak of 12.1% in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
\t
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3% from 3.5%.
\t
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
\t
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.

The photograph hung behind a grid of window panes at the entrance to Universal Furniture’s High Point, N.C., showroom is just a sliver of a face, but it puts Houston interior designer Nina Magon front-and-center in America’s growing demand for modern home furnishings.
\t
\t
Magon, the Houston-based founder of Contour Interior Design, this week debuts her 50-piece European-style modern furniture collection to interior designers and furniture retailers on their semi-annual buying trips.
\t
\t
Spread across 6,000 square feet of the furniture maker’s red brick building are beds, dressers, tables chairs, sofas, desks and pieces of furniture designed by Magon for any room in your home. And it’s more affordable than you might think, with chairs $800 and up and sofas starting around $2,000. You can get a side table for $695 or a cocktail table or console for about $1,500.
\t
That it’s European modern means they’re lower profile, so chairs, sofas and beds sit a little lower to the ground with more rounded edges and curved pieces rather than straight, hard lines. She mixes leather, mohair and velvet and uses bronze, marble and smoked glass in interesting combinations. Case goods — such as dressers and desks — come in different finishes, in ebony, ash and washed walnut, or lacquers.
\t
“It’s affordable luxury, very functional and comfortable,” said the 39-year-old Magon, who lives in Memorial with her husband, Karun Magon, owner of Capital Builders construction company, and their two children. “The price points are amazing … but if you see the collection, it does not look like it would cost that little. We use bronze metal and tinted glass, leather and marble, and it’s all very luxurious.”
\t
\t
Magon and her Universal team — including CEO Jeffrey Scheffer and marketing director Neil MacKenzie — are waiting to see which retail stores’ buyers pick up which pieces. In the next several days, buyers will sort through her collection and hundreds of others scattered throughout the 10 million square feet of this industry trade show.
\t
Their picks are what end up in stores all over the country for fall purchase, most becoming available sometime in September. So we’ll know later where her furniture can be purchased in the Houston area, but right now, various parts of Universal Furniture’s offerings can be found here at Dillard’s and Star Furniture stores throughout the area as well as Brown Interiors in Pearland and Icon Furniture in Stafford.
\t
Magon launched her own interior design firm in Houston in 2008 after building spec homes and running her own lingerie store in the Galleria. Her stylish, fashion-driven projects are known for their glamor and sophistication, in a black-white-gray palette with occasional jewel tone accents. Even her company branding slogan — Living Stylish — connects fashion and home design as Magon urges people to use their fashion savvy throughout their lives.
\t
Like many designers, she creates custom pieces for residential and hospitality clients, and at one time designed a 30-piece modern furniture collection she thought she might someday have manufactured. Just one piece from those designs — a console table — made it to the new collection with Universal Furniture, the rest was deemed too much like functional art to be manufactured for a mass audience.
\t
Her work reached a broader audience in 2014 when she was chosen to be one of 12 designers on the first season of NBC’s “American Dream Builders” reality TV show, and stayed in the competition through the semifinalist level.
\t
\t
A couple of years ago, Magon was part of a design bloggers tour at a High Point market event and spoke on a panel in the Universal building. It was clear her style wasn’t like that of many traditional American designers, and Magon talked about the need for modern furniture created by American companies. For her own needs, she found herself shopping at markets in Milan or elsewhere in Europe — not in America, she told that audience.
\t
Universal Furniture executives were there and Magon’s message struck a nerve — at the same time, they were contemplating their own next steps in the modern furniture market.
\t
“Nina had a definitive take on what she wanted to do and had a lot of ideas. We were looking for someone who had an opinion — and one that was different aesthetically from what whe had already in our line,” MacKenzie said. “She came with a totally fresh perspective, a European modern look. We’ve done well with modern but this was a different take. It was exciting for us and she showed us a different way to do it.”
\t
MacKenzie believes even people with traditional, transitional or contemporary homes might want to use something from Magon’s collection.
\t
“We showed it to people in the Heartland, Atlanta and the West Coast, and it resonates very well,” MacKenzie said. “In South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina, we really didn’t know what the reaction would be, but so far everyone thinks it’s extremely elegant.”
\t
\t
Both Magon and Universal Furniture executives hope this new collection can help feed a market of American consumers increasingly leaning toward contemporary and modern decor.
\t
For Magon, it’s another step in her own personal and professional journey.
\t
“It feels unreal. I remember eight or nine years ago it was my first time going to High Point, and someone was debuting a furniture collection. I remember thinking, ‘one day that could be me,’” Magon said.
\t
And she said that any furniture designer proud of her work will have it in her own home, and already she’s thinking of using the DuChamps desk in her son’s room.
\t
“I’m also looking at the blue chair. I’ll probably have quite a few pieces,” she said. “That’s the true love of design. If a designer is proud of their collection, you’ll see it at their house, and I’m extremely proud.”

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
\t
2:45 p.m.
\t
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
\t
\t
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
\t
\t
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.

The European Central Bank has kept its policy promises, interest rates and stimulus settings unchanged as officials weigh looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
\t
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
\t
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a news conference Thursday, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more monetary stimulus in coming months. Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for an interest rate increase from the end of the year into next year.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A new professional league for elite swimmers will debut this year with U.S. and foreign teams competing in a mixed gender format with the athletes being paid.
\t
Five-time Olympic champion Katie Ledecky will compete for one of the International Swimming League\'s eight teams — four based in the U.S. and four in Europe.
\t
\t
Ledecky said the league "represents a new era for professional swimming."
\t
\t
"Especially for competitive women like me," she said Tuesday. "Jumping in the pool for the ISL really means a new era for women since it\'s one of the first leagues to emphasize gender equality as one of its values."
\t
Besides Ledecky, fellow Americans Nathan Adrian, Simone Manuel and Ryan Murphy have been tabbed as ambassadors. They\'re expected to both compete and help promote the inaugural season.
\t
The ISL won\'t begin until after this summer\'s world championships in South Korea, while a planned 2020 season would start after the Tokyo Olympics.
\t
Founded by Ukrainian financier Konstantin Grigorishin, the league will launch Oct. 4-5, with meets held nearly every weekend through Nov. 24. The league championship will be in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay in a temporary pool on Dec. 20-21. The racing will be in short-course meters rather than the long-course format used in the Olympics.
\t
"The show that is going to go around it will be quite a production, very fan-oriented," former Olympic medalist Kaitlin Sandeno said.
\t
The U.S. will be represented by: the New York Breakers, the Los Angeles Current, the DC Trident, and the Cali Condors based in San Francisco.
\t
The Breakers will be overseen by general manager Tina Andrew, mother and manager of swimmer Michael Andrew. The Current will be led by retired Olympic backstroke champion Lenny Krayzelburg, the Condors by retired four-time Olympic champion Jason Lezak, and the Trident by Sandeno.
\t
\t
The European teams will be based in London, Rome, Budapest and likely France.
\t
Full rosters will be announced in the coming weeks.
\t
Swimmers will compete for team points in various styles of races, with 12 men and 12 women on each team. The ISL said numerous Olympic champions and world record holders will participate.
\t
"There\'s something about competing for a team title," five-time Olympic champion Adrian said. "It\'s a different kind of energy than what swimmers are used to."
\t
The ISL will have a zero tolerance doping policy and won\'t allow any swimmer with a previous doping violation to participate.
\t
Swimmers will sign two contracts: one with their team and another with the ISL. Revenue will flow from the clubs and the league to the athletes. Grigorishin said revenue will be split 50-50 between the league and swimmers.
\t
"We have one of the hardest working athletes in the sports world and they deserve more than we have gotten so far," Krayzelburg said. "It\'s going to change the landscape, create more exposure and opportunities for our athletes and put the sport of swimming on the forefront, not just in the Olympic year."
\t
Currently, professional swimmers have the TYR Pro Swim Series in the U.S. and the FINA World Cup between August and November in Europe, Asia and the Middle East in which they compete for prize money.
\t
The ISL has overcome roadblocks to its formation, having filed a federal antitrust lawsuit last year against FINA, the sport\'s international governing body.
\t
FINA announced its own Champions Swim Series made up of invitation-only meets in Guangzhou, Budapest and Indianapolis in April and May. Total prize money is $3.9 million and the competitions will include some of the sport\'s biggest names.
\t
\t
"We have no principle conflict with FINA," Grigorishin said. "FINA should be responsible for the whole swimming world. The league is just for the elite swimmers. Somebody has to regulate and set up the rules in swimming. If you are a regulator, you should not be organizer of competition. In the future, FINA will have to make a choice."
\t
Grigorishin said negotiations with global broadcasting outlets are ongoing.


\t
MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights ruled Tuesday that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
\t
\t
Navalny, a prominent opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed the ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
\t
The court in Strasbourg ruled that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities. It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 20,000 euros ($22,550) in damages.
\t
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict to the court\'s highest chamber.
\t
It\'s the second time that the court has ruled against Russia in a matter of months. Last November, the court\'s highest chamber found that Russian authorities violated multiple human rights in detaining Navalny seven times from 2012 to 2014, and that two of the arrests were expressly aimed at "suppressing political pluralism."
\t
It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 63,000 euros in damages, and called on Russia to fix legislation to "take due regard of the fundamental importance of the right to peaceful assembly."
\t
Russia is obliged to carry out the court\'s rulings, which enforce the European Convention on Human Rights, but it has delayed implementing past rulings from the court and argued against them as encroaching on Russian judicial sovereignty.

The European Commission has reduced the number of objections it has registered against Vodafone’s proposed €18.4 billion acquisition of a string of Liberty Global’s telecom assets in Eastern Europe.
\r
A report in the Financial Times suggests that the European Commission has sent a list of objections to Vodafone but that none of them are expected to kill the deal outright.
\r
“We remain confident that the commission will recognise that it will deliver considerable benefits for consumers and competition. We still expect to receive final approval in the middle of this year,”a Vodafone spokesperson told the Financial Times.
\r
If the deal is approved, Vodafone will acquire Liberty Global\'s mobile and fixed line operations in Germany, The Czech Republic, Romania and Hungary.
\r
Earlier this year, Vodafone announced that it will raise 4 billion in cash by issuing two separate bonds €4bn in sterling, with the bonds maturing no later than March 2021 and March 2022.
\r
In December last year, the European Commission launched its initial investigation into the proposed acquisition, amid concerns that the deal could reduce competition in both Germany and The Czech Republic.

The killer app for delivering gigabit services across Europe is human impatience, according to a senior representative from Nokia.
\r
Speaking at the Gigabit Access and Networks 4.0 event in Cologne on Tuesday, Nokia’s fixed networks marketing manager, Keith Russel, said that consumers were no longer prepared to wait for their broadband services to load or buffer, demanding instant and ubiquitous connectivity.
\r
“The killer app for delivering a gigabit society is really just human impatience,” he said.
\r
“With users starting to demand that instant connectivity, operators will have no option but to roll out gigabit services.”
\r
While the majority of conference attendees were in attendance to espouse the benefits of fibre to the home services, Russel said that fibre was only one of the tools in an operators gigabit toolkit.
\r
“Copper, fixed wireless access, COAX and fibre all have a roll to play in delivering gigabit services across the continent,” he said.
\r
“Copper is certainly in decline but I don’t agree with the people who say that there is no utility left in copper. If it fits your business model, use it. It’s just not part of the long term gigabit vision,” he said.
\r
Russel stressed that a range of techniques would be needed to deliver gigabit services across the world and said that the provision of gigabit broadband services was a real opportunity to dramatically reduce the global digital divide.
\r
“We live in an age where only 56 per cent of people in the world have access to broadband speeds of 9.1Mbps or more. Rolling out the gigabit society is a huge opportunity to reduce or even eliminate that digital divide.


European operators should follow the lead of the National Broadband Network (NBD) deployment in Australia, as they look to deliver gigabit capable services to consumers across the continent.\r

European operators should follow the lead of the National Broadband Network (NBD) deployment in Australia, as they look to deliver gigabit capable services to consumers across the continent.
\r
Speaking at the Gigabit Access and Network 4.0 event in Cologne on Tuesday, Netcomm’s director of technology strategy, Els Baert, said that fibre to the home was not always the most viable solution for delivering gigabit connectivity.
\r
“The NBN deployment has proven you simply cannot take fibre into every single home or business via Fibre-to-the-Home (FTTH), it is just not possible within a reasonable time and cost envelope.
\r
“That’s why we have seen NBN Co take a flexible approach and develop a Fibre-to-the-Distribution Point (FTTdP) solution that will connect nearly 1.5 million homes and businesses by the end of next year.
\r
“FTTdP has already resolved the first key challenge for NBN Co., that of connecting Single Dwelling Units with 100/40Mbps broadband – with upgrades to 1Gbps possible - without having to run new fibre to every premises or supplying mains power to thousands of nodes.
\r
Baert said that while full fibre networks remain the ideal standard for delivering next generation connectivity, there was still a role for copper based services in the interim.
\r
“Fibre is clearly the best technology for the future of broadband, but that doesn’t mean there is no role at all for some of the copper that has already been deployed by network operators.
\r
“We need to see the global industry really embrace new solutions like FTTdP along wityh Gfast which can deliver identical services to FTTH and is the fastest and easiest way to delivering Gigabit speeds to end-users,” she concluded.

Germany\'s top data security expert has warned that legislation passed by the US government could enable it to spy on its European neighbours via Amazon\'s cloud hosting service.
\r
Ulrich Kelber, Germany\'s federal commissioner for data protection and freedom of information, told news site Politico that the Trump government\'s Cloud Act could allow the US government to demand the release of \'sensitive data\' held by Amazon Web Services.
\r
Germany has recently announced plans to equip its federal police force with Motorola recording devices which automatically upload data to the Amazon Cloud.
\r
"For the storage of such sensitive data, we need a cloud provider that is exclusively subject to European data protection law — not a provider that is also subject to the US Cloud Act,” Kelber told Politico during a telephone interview.
\r
The US has been lobbying European governments to exclude Chinese network equipment provider, Huawei, from their 5G rollout programmes, saying that the company could be compelled to allow the Chinese government to access its networks for nefarious purposes.

BERLIN (AP) — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members — or those hoping to join — could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.
Of the 16 participating countries — Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia — 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has left its policy promises and interest rates unchanged as it weighs looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
The ECB has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve in pausing the withdrawal of stimulus measures deployed over a decade to bounce back from the global financial crisis, as central bankers around the world ponder which way the economy is headed. The Fed has already started raising rates but has backed off plans for further rate increases in 2019.
The ECB\'s 25-member governing council was content to stand pat on Thursday, making no changes to its short policy statement. The bank took several steps to support the economy on March 7. Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.
The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4%, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year — if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3% for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8% from a peak of 12.1% in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3% from 3.5%.
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.


European court: Russia\'s house arrest of Navalny unlawful
MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
Navalny, a leading opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed Tuesday\'s ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled Tuesday that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.

Europe \xe2\x80\x94 and most of the Global North \xe2\x80\x94 is effortlessly prosperous.
In most corners of Europe, especially away from the inner cities where the immigrants live, the streets are spacious and spanking clean.
The people live in beautiful, sometimes ancient, houses which have heating and clean water. In Amsterdam, people are encouraged to drink tap water (it is very safe), smile at strangers and save the world.
The air is pristine and wholesome. If you go for a walk, it is reinvigorating because you pump oxygen, rather than the usual chunks of carbon, into the furnace of your metabolism and are rewarded with energy and vim.
The streets are empty; the people \xe2\x80\x94 and there aren\xe2\x80\x99t too many of them \xe2\x80\x94 are often away at work. The rate of unemployment is almost non-existent compared to Zimbabwe, Congo and many of our countries.
OPPORTUNITIES
Because everybody has some money and the currency has and retains value, it is possible to make a living doing the most routine of things.
If you like cooking, you can start a restaurant on your street and make a good living.
The cars they drive are often much better \xe2\x80\x94 the upholstery, trim and equipment \xe2\x80\x94 than the same models sold down here.
Their governments are, on average, powerful in global affairs and promote the interests of local business to create real, well-paying jobs.
Their countries control the global economy; they get the best resources. If on holiday with a European and you pay the same amount of money, they are given preferential treatment and get more value for their money.
The world is conditioned to give them a first-class ticket to life.
QUALITY CARE
They have strong militaries to protect themselves and enforce their commercial interests.
Diplomatically, they are listened to and backed by coalitions such as Nato and G8. Their police are equipped and skilled to investigate, prevent and contribute to the punishment of crime.
Europeans get a better education and have access to larger stores of knowledge. So they tend to be cleverer and more informed, on average, than people from here.
Because of their history of world conquest, they are culturally and socially confident and more likely to enforce their will.
When you are born in Europe and are white, you know that fate has handed you a strong hand in the lottery of life.
ARMY
While we are not any less human, our circumstances are not so fortunate in the South. The average city here is teeming with humanity.
The streets will be dusty and often filthy, particularly away from the thoroughfares. The jobs are not so good. Many work in the informal sector, in markets selling low-quality products. The majority have no jobs.
On average, our militaries are... well, they have uniforms of one description or the other, and a rifle.
When the militaries of the North send forces to our parts, it is usually 20, 30, sometimes 40 soldiers. And they are enough to deal with a foe that has defeated 20,000 of our forces.
No one listens to us really, other than out of a sense that everyone, including those who don\xe2\x80\x99t matter much, are entitled to the appearance of being listened to.
EQUALITY
Often, the countries from the north, working in alliance, run rings around us and leave us exhausted and confused.
The vast majority of us only have a little education and are unprepared for the complex, alien rituals that constitute the conduct of global business and diplomacy.
So, we are sometimes diffident, but lack the smooth confidence of those born into those cultures.
We have little exposure and have read some books, but with a kerosene lamp. We come off as less informed and more foolish than we sometimes are.
The citizens of the global south are discriminated against casually and as a matter of course.
People will swear that they are not, that everyone is equal. And everyone will pretend to believe it. Southerners are not really welcome in most places.
RESOURCES
We, the people of the global south, are workers in an invisible northern factory. Most of our lives are dedicated, ultimately, to supporting the high living standards and prosperity of the North.
The North would possibly survive without our resources, our markets and our labour, but they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it so good and so easy.
Here is the punchline, and it\xe2\x80\x99s good news: We have the resources and the populations to build societies that are as prosperous, with cities that are as wholesome and clean, as those in Europe.
And we could do it, not in centuries, but in generations. And we can live life on our own terms. Our opinion can matter in world discourse.
People would take our views seriously because that\xe2\x80\x99s what you do with people who are rich and independent.
INTEGRITY
And people would welcome us into their resorts, cruise ships and hotels because that is what, generally speaking, you do with millionaires.
We can do it if we stop stealing public funds, if we have systems based on merit and if we have committed, intellectually-gifted leaders with solid values.
Africa is stuck in the muck because it is led, in general, by thieves who are also not very clever.
On a light note, we are enslaved by the witchcraft of political elites who have taught us that tribalism is more important than competence.
I wonder what would happen if Kenyans elected Prof Kivutha Kibwana president.

DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) — China\'s prime minister promised Friday that his government will respect European standards and fair trade, seeking to allay concerns that it is flouting European Union competition rules with huge investments on the continent.
Opening an annual summit between Eastern and Central European nations and China, Li Keqiang said "we intend to fully respect European standards."
The Chinese government has also been criticized for failing to give reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
"We welcome openness and we want to treat all companies that operate in China equally and to increase imports from the (European) countries," he said. "China is open to the world...we welcome the two-way openness."
EU member Croatia is hosting a two-day summit between China and 16 regional countries on expanding business between China and the region, dubbed 16+1.
Several Eastern European countries are part of China\'s ambitious "Belt and Road" investment and construction project that aims to create a gateway to western European markets. The project includes upgrading infrastructure to create a network of transport and trade links between Asia and Europe.
Beijing has created a $3-billion fund and announced a $10-billion credit line for the 16 countries in the region.
At the start of the plenary meeting, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said that over a relatively short time, the initiative "has resulted in the establishment of new ties and projects" also becoming a platform for "intense and substantial political dialogue" between the participating states.
He also announced that Greece will join the coalition. The vision is to have the Chinese-controlled Greek port of Piraeus become an entry point for Chinese goods to Europe by linking it to railroads and highways that are also part of China\'s investments.


European court: Russia\'s house arrest of Navalny unlawful
MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights ruled Tuesday that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
Navalny, a prominent opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed the ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities. It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 20,000 euros ($22,550) in damages.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict to the court\'s highest chamber.
It\'s the second time that the court has ruled against Russia in a matter of months. Last November, the court\'s highest chamber found that Russian authorities violated multiple human rights in detaining Navalny seven times from 2012 to 2014, and that two of the arrests were expressly aimed at "suppressing political pluralism."
It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 63,000 euros in damages, and called on Russia to fix legislation to "take due regard of the fundamental importance of the right to peaceful assembly."
Russia is obliged to carry out the court\'s rulings, which enforce the European Convention on Human Rights, but it has delayed implementing past rulings from the court and argued against them as encroaching on Russian judicial sovereignty.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members — or those hoping to join — could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.
Of the 16 participating countries — Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia — 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

European Central Bank holds rates as uncertainties grow

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has left its policy promises and interest rates unchanged as it weighs looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
The ECB has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve in pausing the withdrawal of stimulus measures deployed over a decade to bounce back from the global financial crisis, as central bankers around the world ponder which way the economy is headed. The Fed has already started raising rates but has backed off plans for further rate increases in 2019.
The ECB\'s 25-member governing council was content to stand pat on Thursday, making no changes to its short policy statement. The bank took several steps to support the economy on March 7. Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.
The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4%, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year — if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3% for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8% from a peak of 12.1% in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3% from 3.5%.
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.

European researchers to drill for ancient Antarctic ice
BERLIN (AP) — A group of 14 European scientific institutions plan to retrieve the world\'s oldest ice as part of research into past climate change.
The consortium led by the Germany-based Alfred Wegener Institute said Tuesday it has identified an area in Antarctica, nicknamed "Little Dome C," that should harbor ice as old as 1.5 million years.
So-called ice core measurements are crucial for scientists\' understanding of past climatic changes on Earth and the models they use to predict future global warming or cooling.
Current ice core measurements provide reliable data going back only about 800,000 years.
At a meeting in Vienna, the institutes said they spent the past three years working with American, Australian, Japanese and Russian colleagues using radar to determine the best possible site for drilling.

BERLIN (AP) — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."

European court: Russia\'s house arrest of Navalny unlawful
MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights ruled Tuesday that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
Navalny, a prominent opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed the ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities. It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 20,000 euros ($22,550) in damages.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict to the court\'s highest chamber.
It\'s the second time that the court has ruled against Russia in a matter of months. Last November, the court\'s highest chamber found that Russian authorities violated multiple human rights in detaining Navalny seven times from 2012 to 2014, and that two of the arrests were expressly aimed at "suppressing political pluralism."
It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 63,000 euros in damages, and called on Russia to fix legislation to "take due regard of the fundamental importance of the right to peaceful assembly."
Russia is obliged to carry out the court\'s rulings, which enforce the European Convention on Human Rights, but it has delayed implementing past rulings from the court and argued against them as encroaching on Russian judicial sovereignty.

DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) — China\'s prime minister has promised that Beijing will respect European standards and fair trade, seeking to allay concerns that it\'s flouting EU competition rules with huge investments on the continent.
Opening an annual summit of Eastern and Central European nations and China, Li Keqiang said "we intend to fully respect European standards."
Beijing has also been criticized for failing to give reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
He adds "we welcome openness and we want to treat all companies that operate in China equally and to increase imports from the (European) countries."
EU member Croatia is hosting a two-day summit between China and 16 regional countries on expanding business between China and the region, dubbed 16+1.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members — or those hoping to join — could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.
Of the 16 participating countries — Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia — 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

BERLIN (AP) — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."


European researchers to drill for ancient Antarctic ice
BERLIN (AP) — A group of 14 European scientific institutions plan to retrieve the world\'s oldest ice as part of research into past climate change.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
The consortium led by the Germany-based Alfred Wegener Institute said Tuesday it has identified an area in Antarctica, nicknamed "Little Dome C," that should harbor ice as old as 1.5 million years.
So-called ice core measurements are crucial for scientists\' understanding of past climatic changes on Earth and the models they use to predict future global warming or cooling.
Current ice core measurements provide reliable data going back only about 800,000 years.
At a meeting in Vienna, the institutes said they spent the past three years working with American, Australian, Japanese and Russian colleagues using radar to determine the best possible site for drilling.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.
___
1:50 p.m.
The European Central Bank has kept its policy promises, interest rates and stimulus settings unchanged as officials weigh looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a news conference Thursday, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more monetary stimulus in coming months. Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for an interest rate increase from the end of the year into next year.

European court: Russia\'s house arrest of Navalny unlawful
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
Navalny, a leading opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed Tuesday\'s ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled Tuesday that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has left its policy promises and interest rates unchanged as it weighs looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
The ECB has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve in pausing the withdrawal of stimulus measures deployed over a decade to bounce back from the global financial crisis, as central bankers around the world ponder which way the economy is headed. The Fed has already started raising rates but has backed off plans for further rate increases in 2019.
The ECB\'s 25-member governing council was content to stand pat on Thursday, making no changes to its short policy statement. The bank took several steps to support the economy on March 7. Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.
The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4 percent, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year — if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3 percent for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8 percent from a peak of 12.1 percent in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3 percent from 3.5 percent.
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."

DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) — China\'s prime minister has promised that Beijing will respect European standards and fair trade, seeking to allay concerns that it\'s flouting EU competition rules with huge investments on the continent.
Opening an annual summit of Eastern and Central European nations and China, Li Keqiang said "we intend to fully respect European standards."
Beijing has also been criticized for failing to give reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
He adds "we welcome openness and we want to treat all companies that operate in China equally and to increase imports from the (European) countries."
EU member Croatia is hosting a two-day summit between China and 16 regional countries on expanding business between China and the region, dubbed 16+1.

Ajovy (fremanezumab), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE: TEVA; TASE: TEVA) branded injectable drug for treatment of migraines, has received European Commission approval for marketing in the 28 EU member countries, plus Iceland, Norway, and Lichtenstein. The approval was more good news for Teva, after a report today that the European Patent Office had ratified a patent protecting Copaxone, Teva\'s original drug for treatment of multiple sclerosis, in 40-milligram dosages.
\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
Ajovy has been developed for adults who suffer from migraines at least four days a month. Teva says that the drug, which is a monoclonal antibody, is the only anti-CGRP drug that has been approved for marketing. The company asserts that its drug offers quarterly and monthly dosage options for preventing migraine headaches. The drug was approved for marketing in the US several months ago. Teva obtained Ajovy as part of its acquisition of Labrys in 2014, the first acquisition led by then-CEO Erez Vigodman. The drug achieved positive results in clinical trials in 2017 in treatment of both chronic and acute migraines.
Teva European Commercial EVP Richard Daniell said, "Migraine can have a significant impact on the day-to-day life of patients, with some experiencing 15 headache days per month. It is our hope that Ajovy will provide patients and European healthcare professionals with a preventive treatment that offers patients more migraine free days, as well as greater flexibility in managing this unpredictable disease.
"The approval of fremanezumab is also an important step in our focus on biopharmaceuticals, the next generation of innovative medicines, coupled with our ongoing commitment to developing treatments for disorders of the central nervous system (CNS).”
Revenue from Ajovy, which won FDA approval in September, was just $3 million in 2018 but is expected to grow to $150 million this year.

While in the US, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.\'s (NYSE: TEVA; TASE: TEVA) original multiple sclerosis treatment Copaxone is already battling it out with generic competitors with its main dosage (40mg), in Europe there is still no generic competition, and a decision by the European Patent Office (EPO) should delay it further. Teva announce today that a three-member panel of the EPO Opposition Division upheld the patent (EP 2 949 335) covering its Copaxone 40mg product in Europe. The Opposition Division will issue its written underlying rationale on the decision within a few months.
Teva has already obtained preliminary injunction orders on the basis of the patent to prevent the commercialization of generic versions of the product in Belgium, Denmark and Slovakia.
\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
European sales of Copaxone amounted to $535 million in 2018, down from the $595 million recorded in 2017. For years, Copaxone was Teva\'s cash cow, its biggest selling and most profitable product. It met with generic competition in the US, its main market, several years ago, but Teva managed to transfer most patients from the 20mg dosage to 40mg, which diminished the impact of competition. In late 2017, however, generic competition began in the higher dosage as well, and since then, as expected, Copaxone\'s contribution to Teva\'s results has declined and its price has been eroded.
As mentioned, there is no generic competition with Copaxone yet. The EPO\'s decision means that the patent protecting Copaxone 40mg is valid until 2030, although Teva\'s competitors can appeal against the decision.
Richard Daniell, executive vice president Teva Europe, said, “We are pleased that the EPO agreed with Teva’s stance on the patent for Copaxone 40mg. Teva will continue to robustly defend the validity of the intellectual property portfolio protecting Copaxone 40mg.
"We believe in the value of Copaxone, a treatment that has been studied extensively for more than 20 years and has 2.5 million years of patient experience. We remain strongly committed in the field of neurosciences and are privileged to improve people’s lives in the field of multiple sclerosis”.

Following the successful launch of the Leaders\' Meeting and Awards in 2018, Emerging Europe, a London-based business, media and research platform, whose mission is to contribute to the social and economic growth of 23 countries of Central and South-Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, is delighted to have launched applications for the 2019 edition.
\r
\xe2\x80\x9cThe 2018 Leaders\' Meeting and Awards attracted nearly 600 applicants from 23 countries,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew Wrobel, founding partner, strategy and content at Emerging Europe. \xe2\x80\x9cThis year we\'ve added new categories and we expect even higher interest and even more interesting initiatives.\xe2\x80\x9d
\r
There are seventeen categories divided into three groups: image building, social and economic growth, and two special categories for individuals contributing to the region\xe2\x80\x99s growth; one originating from the region and one from outside the region.
\r
Lifetime Achievement Awards will be offered by the Emerging Europe Council, consisting of 12 business and political leaders, and social activists such as Professor Gu\xcc\x88nter Verheugen, former vice-president of the European Commission, Ivan Miklos\xcc\x8c, former deputy prime minister of Slovakia, Ion Sturza, former prime minister of Moldova, and Olga Grygier- Siddons, former CEO of PwC CEE.
\r
In 2018, Emerging Europe published it\'s own Investment Promotion Report (full ranking below). This year the organisation will publish its first Business-Friendly City Perception Index.
\r
\xe2\x80\x9cThe Leaders\' Meeting and Awards are about rewarding excellence and highlighting best practice across the region. We want to show the best of the region and help raise standards,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Wrobel. \xe2\x80\x9cBoth the Investment Promotion Report and the Business-Friendly City Perception Index have been developed to serve these goals. During the event we organise an investment roundtable where we share knowledge and experiences.\xe2\x80\x9d
\r
\xe2\x80\x9cOne important element which is very often underestimated is the exchange of best practices, and that is exactly what you are trying to do here. We tell each other what we have achieved, how we have achieved it, what our problems are. My strong advice would be to concentrate very much on these exchanges,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gu\xcc\x88nter Verheugen, former vice- president of the European Commission, and the winner of the 2018 Lifetime Achievement Award.
\r
PwC CEE, which covers the entire emerging Europe region, remains the Leaders\' Meeting and Awards strategic partner.
\r
\xe2\x80\x9cThe first Leaders\' Meeting and Awards ceremony was a great success. Not only was it an inspirational showcase for how dynamic, innovative, and passionate the emerging Europe region is \xe2\x80\x94 but the organisers did a great job of fostering a sense of community among participants from several countries. Our involvement provided us with many great opportunities to build relationships with representatives of businesses, governments, investment promotion agencies and financial institutions.\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeffery McMillan, director, global communications, PwC.
\r
The 2018 Awards were given to 11 winners from ten countries: Invest Lithuania, Siemens Czech Republic, Solaris, Amazon, City of Wroc\xc5\x82aw, City of Ljubljana, DeepDee, Teach for Armenia, We Care Men Care, New Bazaar Tirana and Professor Gu\xcc\x88nter Verheugen.

For the past five years, the European Investment Bank has provided 1.5 billion euros for the Bulgarian economy. Last year alone, the bank provided EUR 103 million in loans for various projects and the European Investment Fund supported eight projects worth a total of EUR 114 million. The largest investment of the ECB for the year 2018 is a loan of 14 million euros to Agria Group Holding for a new port facility in Varna, a EUR 22 million loan to the Sofia Municipality, which funds the construction of line 3 of the second phase of the Sofia metro and EUR 67 million for the construction and commissioning of a new combined heat power plant for the district heating network in Sofia, managed by Toplofikacia Sofia EAD. This was made clear at a special press conference given by the bank\'s representation in Bulgaria on 15 March 2019.
\r
"In 2018, we performed strongly in Bulgaria, especially with the expansion of our advisory services and we continue to support the economy in the new year with two important transactions." The EIB Group\'s financing accounted for close to 0.4% of Bulgaria\'s GDP in the past a year that is above the EU average, while the consultancy services provided helped to implement projects worth nearly 2 billion euros, demonstrating the important role of the bank in the country, "said EIB Vice President Vazil Hudak.
\r
The European Investment Fund continued to support small and medium-sized enterprises in Bulgaria by allocating funds totaling EUR 78 million through four new guarantee operations and a new venture capital fund totaling EUR 168 million for debt and equity financing.
\r
Thanks to EIF\'s activities in Bulgaria, 3,000 small and medium-sized enterprises in the year 2018 received funding of nearly EUR 408 million. Given the success of the Jeremy initiative, the EIF and the Bulgarian Ministry of Economy agreed in the past year to launch two new financial instruments with the accumulated funds through the Jeremy activities. The documentary financial guarantee instrument will absorb up to EUR 30 million of the accumulated funds for new trade finance guarantees in support of the international profile and the diversification of the Bulgarian economy with a loan amounting to EUR 200 million. The InvestBG Equity program will use Jeremy\'s proceeds and EIF\'s own funds to commit up to \xe2\x82\xac 110 million in venture capital and equity investment in Bulgaria and direct equity participation in Bulgarian companies. It is envisaged that the first transactions under the Documentary Financial Guarantee Instrument and the InvestBG Equity program will be implemented in 2019.
\r
EIB Vice President Vazil Hudak also drew attention to the EIB\'s advisory services. Bulgaria is one of the largest users of these services. Since 2006, Jaspers has helped to complete a large number of Bulgarian investment projects, whose total value exceeds EUR 5.5 billion for 30 major projects, with nearly EUR 3.9 billion in grants, provided with the assistance of the European Commission. In addition to already completed projects, Jaspers currently works in Bulgaria for 28 consultancy and capacity building projects.
\r
In 2018, four major projects supported by Jaspers were approved by the commission. The total value of the investments amounted to EUR 1.23 billion, as well as a EUR 882 million grant. In 2018, JASPERS acted actively on completion of the consultancy assistance for the project for the preparation of the natural gas pipeline between Greece and Bulgaria, with a total value of about 240 million euros.
\r
The Project Advisory Services Unit (PASU) provides flexible and targeted advisory support on EIB-provided projects to Member States. Funding is from European funds and the goal is to increase the level and quality of ESF funds absorption through better governance, attraction of funds and investment results. In Bulgaria, the unit mainly deals with assistance provided for the implementation of projects, the preparation of strategic documents and the building of institutional capacity.
\r
The European Investment Policy Advisory Center is an expression of the partnership between the EIB and the European Commission and a single point of access to a wide range of advisory services and technical assistance. By the end of 2018, the Center processed 79 requests from Bulgaria - from inquiries to information to technical assistance, funding, or both. Of these, 65 requests were for specific projects, 35 for the private sector and 10 for comprehensive advisory assistance.
\r
In connection with the Financial Instruments Consultations Department (FIA), in August 2017, a special ECCIP consultancy agreement was signed for structuring and developing a Platform for Urban Investment in Bulgaria. Under this framework, the FIA \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bprovides support to the Bulgarian Fund for the Development of its ESF-based financial instruments (FIS) for urban development. This support was provided in connection with the testing of unstable markets in the banking sector and the choice of managers of financial instruments. In September 2018, agreements were signed between the FNF and the elected FI managers, allowing the three urban development funds to start their work.
\r
Advisory Services InnovFin (IFA), a joint initiative of the EIB and the EC under Horizon 2020, which aims to improve suitability for project financing and provides strategic studies that are not specific projects but relate to the challenges of access to finance faced by R & D investment. Currently, IFA provides consultancy for software investments and hardware development worth \xe2\x82\xac 30 million to identify appropriate funding opportunities, including debt or venture capital financing.
\r
Before the presentation of the EIB\'s activity in Bulgaria, Vazil Hudak announced that for the year 2019, the bank had already signed two financing contracts. One is a EUR 18 million loan for the Software Group. "This venture capital financing is a new product of the EIB, which is first implemented in Bulgaria," Hudak said.
\r
\xc2\xa0The second loan for which the EIB signed a contract this year is EUR 20 million for Raiffeisen Leasing. According to Dobromir Dobrev, Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of Raiffeisenbank (Bulgaria), with the money from the EIB will provide new leasing financing for a wide range of customers for the purchase of equipment, trucks and trailers, light trucks and cars, etc. "This will support the investment plans of Bulgarian companies and increase their competitiveness," Dobrev said.

A right wing MP has threatened an LGBTI photography exhibition meant to take place in Plovdiv, the 2019 European Capital of Culture co-host.
\r
Opening in July, the exhibition is called \xe2\x80\x98Balkan Pride\xe2\x80\x99. However, politicians have said they will try to stop the exhibition by any means necessary.
\r
Alexander Sidi, an MP from nationalist VMRO party, told a press conference: \xe2\x80\x98We don\xe2\x80\x99t want them to do it. And we will stop them, using all legal \xe2\x80\x93 and, if required, illegal means.\xe2\x80\x99
\r
The first step is the removal of the municipal cultural foundation chief, Svetlana Kuyumdzhieva. The city council are voting on it on Monday (8 April). They hope this will force the city mayor to take action against the exhibition.
\r
According to the\xc2\xa0Guardian, Borislav Inchev, who represents VMRO\xe2\x80\x99s Plovdiv\xe2\x80\x99s branch, said: \xe2\x80\x98This is the same as carrying out a gay pride parade in Plovdiv.
\r
\xe2\x80\x98I am very curious what would happen if a teacher made a mistake and sent her schoolchildren to see the exhibition \xe2\x80\x93 what would they see; how would she explain it?\xe2\x80\x99
Run by an LGBTI rights group
\r
\r
The exhibition itself features photographs taken during gay pride events across the Balkan region, an area in southeast Europe.\xc2\xa0 There will also be a concert and a discussion forum. LGBTI rights group the Glas foundation organized the event.
\r
A representative from Glas, Simeon Vassilev said the are doing everything they can to make sure the exhibition goes ahead.
\r
He said: \xe2\x80\x98Politicians seem to not understand the content of a cultural product, and they fail to realize that the European Capital of Culture should not be politicized and filled with intrigues.
\r
\xe2\x80\x98The theme of Plovdiv 2019 is \xe2\x80\x9cTogether\xe2\x80\x9d. Where is the togetherness at the moment?\xe2\x80\x99
\r
The European Capital of Culture is chosen by the European Union for a single year. If selected, the city hosts a series of events to celebrate its culture.

In eight EU countries, however, there are still crowded prisons, reported NOVA TV.\xc2\xa0
\r
\xc2\xa0
\r
The number of prisoners in Europe has sharply decreased between 2016 and early 2018. Eight countries, including France, are still facing "serious overcrowding problems" in prisons. This is the study of the Council of Europe.
\r
The number of prisoners during this period has decreased by 6.6 per cent - from 109.7 to 102.5 per 100,000 inhabitants, according to an investigation by the School of Criminology at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. It prepares for the Council annual reports on people held in prisons in Europe.
\r
Decrease in prisoners is particularly noticeable in countries such as Romania (16%), Bulgaria (15%) and Norway (11.6%).
However, the number of prisoners is increasing in Ireland - by 25.4 per cent.
\r
As of January 31, 2018, there were a total of 1,229,385 prisoners in the 44 member countries of the Council who responded to the university questionnaire. Nearly half of them are in Russia, the authors of the report noted. The previous one, published in March 2018, showed an increased number of prisoners by 2.2% - 859102 and even 1.5 million if a prison sentence was added to Russia after Moscow had not provided data.
\r
No statistics are available from Turkey, Belgium and Hungary.
\r
Among the most imprisoned countries are Russia (602,176), the United Kingdom and Wales (84,373), Poland (73,822) and France (69,596). The least prisoners are in Germany and the Netherlands, says study leader Marcelo Abei of the University of Lausanne.
\r
The most severe problems due to prison overcrowding are encountered in Northern Macedonia (122 prisoners per 100 seats), Romania (120) and France (116), the analysis also shows. The average European index is 91 prisoners per 100 seats.
\r
France holds suicide championships in prisons (12.6 per 10 000 inmates) and escapes (611).
\r
In 2017, European countries allocated a total of \xe2\x82\xac 20.2 billion to their prisons. The average daily subsistence allowance for a prisoner in Europe is \xe2\x82\xac 67.\xc2\xa0

Bulgaria grants \xe2\x82\xac 200,000 in humanitarian aid to reduce migratory flows to Europe. This is envisaged in the draft agreement between the country and the European Investment Bank approved by the Council of Ministers.
\r
Bulgaria is thus part of the Economic Sustainability Initiative, which provides support also for funding projects in the Western Balkan countries to overcome the causes of increased migration to Europe.
\r
The funds will be provided from the MFA budget, dedicated to official development aid and humanitarian aid.
\r
The agreement follows the priorities set in the Medium-term Development and Humanitarian Aid Program for the period 2016-2019, adopted by the Council of Ministers.
\r
Bulgaria\'s involvement in the initiative is a solidarity contribution to tackling the most serious challenges related to development, humanitarian and migration processes arising in the neighbourhood of the European Union.

Commission to the European Parliament approves a draft law that will impose fines on Facebook, Google, Twitter and other social platforms if they do not remove extremist content within one hour of their publication, Reuters reported.
\r
The draft was approved by 35 votes in favor and eight abstentions in the Committee on Justice and Home Affairs. Next week it will be examined in the plenary and, if approved, negotiations are going on between the three EU institutions.
\r
This bill, which provides for fines of up to 4 percent of the offender\'s annual turnover, was approved last year by member states. But there were concerns that the measure would primarily affect small online platforms and also violate human rights. That is why the debate in Parliament has been delayed so far.
\r
The introduction of the measure has become very topical since the terrorist, who in March killed 50 people and wounded dozens in Christchurch, New Zealand, transmitted the live shooting on one of the Facebook platforms.
\r
Facebook has announced that it has removed 1.5 million videos from the bloodshed in the first 24 hours after the attack. EU representatives, however, argue that the first hour is key to deter further dissemination of such content and that Internet companies do not do enough on a voluntary basis.
\r
Companies usually rely on a combination of automatic means and a human factor to detect and eradicate extremist content. But when illegal content is dropped from a platform, it often appears on another platform, and this limits network control capabilities, Reuters explains.

On Thursday, MEPs will vote on rules to combat illegal practices in the road freight sector and amendments to rules on driving time for drivers, the European Parliament (EP) said.
\r
This is the first "Mobility" package, popularized as the Macron Pack. It provoked division by country. Bulgaria has opposed the changes, but there is no solid support so they will not pass.
\r
With procedural holdings, eastern European countries, including Bulgaria, have tried to postpone the vote on the controversial package, but failed.
\r
On Tuesday, the EP Transport Committee voted 1126 amendments to the package of 1224 submitted proposals during the March plenary session.
\r
The proposals aim to improve the rules in the road transport sector and to address the problem of illegal practices such as the use of mailbox companies or the carrying out of activities outside the national market.
\r
The proposals will set new rules for seconded drivers, including minimum wage and driver break time.
\r
What exactly will be finally adopted will become clear on Thursday in plenary. Now, for each of these requests, there are several suggestions that are mutually exclusive.
On Wednesday, Bulgarian MEPs again demanded that the "Mobility" package be dropped from the EP\'s agenda on Thursday, but did not receive support.
\r
Moreover, the EP\'s chairman on Thursday will have the opportunity to group the amendments voted in the Transport and Tourism Committee and to adopt them as "block", not each separately, for which the Bulgarian MEPs insist.
\r
Consideration of the Mobility package was on the agenda of the European Parliament on 25 March. It was then dismissed by EP President Antonio Tajani with the argument that the large number of proposals have not yet been translated and MEPs are not familiar with them.
\r
Tajani has now announced that the amendments can be arranged at the discretion of the chairperson of the vote in groups according to whether they are similar.
\r
"For the fifth time, they are trying to put the ballot in. This has never happened in the history of the EP, and no steps have been taken to find a compromise," said Andrei Novakov (GERB / \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bEPP).
\r
"If we allow this again, if we ignore the outcome of the vote in the Transport Committee, this means that there is no legality in our parliament, and no one can explain that this is right," he added.
\r
German draftsman Ismail Ertwug counterbalances Novakov. "It is clear that there is a possibility for a compromise to be taken by all political groups, and we do not need to be postponed, we want to work for the drivers sector across the European Union," the German Social Democrat said.

Bulgaria\xe2\x80\x99s Sunny Beach has been ranked the best value destination in Europe for a bargain beach break, for the sixth consecutive year. Portugal\xe2\x80\x99s Algarve comes in second place, while Marmaris in Turkey follows in third. Details of the best destinations where your money goes further have been announced in Post Office UK\xe2\x80\x99s 2019 Holiday Costs Baramoter, reports iNews.\xc2\xa0
\r
The annual survey looks at nine tourist items \xe2\x80\x93 including a bottle of suncream, glass of wine and a three-course meal evening meal for two (including a bottle of house wine) \xe2\x80\x93 to establish the cheapest places for UK holidaymakers across Europe.
\r
The study reveals that prices in the Black Sea Resort of Sunny Beach are at least a third cheaper than any of the other 15 destinations surveyed. Dropping 10.7 per cent since 2018, visitors can purchase a bottle of local lager for just \xc2\xa30.70, while a two-course lunch for two people (without drinks) costs \xc2\xa38.42.
\r
At the other end of the scale, visitors to Sorrento in Italy can expect to pay \xc2\xa32.63 for a bottle of local lager, while a three-course evening meal for two people with wine comes in at \xc2\xa380.67. According to the study, prices have fallen in most of the 20 destinations surveyed, and by over 10 per cent in Majorca, the Algarve, Limassol and Sunny Beach, Bulgaria.
\r
Nick Boden, head of Post Office Travel Money, said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe extent to which prices have fallen gives us confidence that if they choose wisely, holidaymakers will still find great value and their holiday budget will go a long way in most resorts. \xe2\x80\x9cThe price falls could be an indication that tourist businesses in European resorts are keen to attract UK visitors and will keep costs low to do so,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.

The number of insect-eating birds, such as beetles and caterpillars, has declined significantly in Europe over the past 25 years, according to a German study.
\xc2\xa0
A 13% reduction in the number of insect-eating birds in Europe between 1990 and 2015 was registered.
\xc2\xa0
The decline reflects a trend associated with a decline in the insect population.
\r
Scientists, however, attribute it to the reduction of green areas and their conversion to arable land.
\xc2\xa0
About half of the bird species in Europe feed on insects. A similar population decline was not recorded among the omnivorous birds.
\xc2\xa0
The study also shows that the populations of a number of bird species, particularly those that adapt to different habitats and living conditions, are stable.
\r
These findings came from experts from the Zennenberg Center for Climate and Biodiversity Studies and the German Center for the Study of Integrated Biodiversity.
\xc2\xa0
The results of the study are published in Conservation Biology.

By decision of the Co-ordination Committee to the Connecting Europe Facility, 27,184 million Euros are granted for the project "Rehabilitation, Modernization and Expansion of the Bulgarian Transmission System - Phase 2" of Bulgartransgaz EAD, the company announced.
\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The activities are for the rehabilitation of two sections of the northern half of the gas transmission system with a total length of about 81 km.
\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The funds are for delivery, construction and commissioning of the two sections, as well as for the related construction supervision activities. The rehabilitation of sections will ensure a more secure and reliable transmission of natural gas. It is envisaged that the rehabilitation activities of the plots will be carried out in the period January 2019 - June 2022, the company added.
\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The main objective of the project of common interest "Rehabilitation, modernization and extension of the Bulgarian transmission system - Phase 2" is to adapt the gas transmission network of Bulgartransgaz EAD to the infrastructure development plans in the region.
\r
This will provide a technical opportunity for the transfer of additional quantities of natural gas through the territory of the country through existing and new entry and exit points such as Greece - Bulgaria, Bulgaria - Serbia interconnectors, the concept of building Balkan Gas Hub as and the plans for expansion of the Underground Gas Storage Chiren, the statement said.

Irish low-cost air carrier Ryanair has entered the top 10 of the largest air pollutants in Europe, taking the tenth place and becoming the only airline in the unprecedented ranking of coal-fired power plants, including the Bulgarian Maritsa East 2 TPP ". BBC reported on Tuesday, citing data from the independent European Transport and Environment NGO.
\r
The largest polluter is the Belhatav Thermal Power Plant in Poland, followed by the German "Noirat" and "Niederaussem". Five German thermal power plants are on the list, while the Bulgarian Maritsa East 2 occupies eighth place. Ranking is closed by Ryanair, which in 2018 has increased carbon dioxide emissions by 6.9 per cent.
\r
However, the airline said it was "the greenest and cleanest European airline" and its passengers have the lowest carbon footprint per kilometer from any other carrier.
\r
Last year, Ryanair launched a new environmental policy to offer its customers the opportunity to offset the carbon footprint of their trip.
\r
Pollution from the aviation sector has increased by about two-thirds since 2005, and forecasts will continue to increase as flights are becoming more affordable, according to the European report.
\r
At this rate, the sector will become the largest carbon footprint within three decades.

\r
Active participation of young people in public debate is of utmost importance. This was said by the Bulgarian commissioner Maria Gabriel during a discussion with the students from the French language school Alfons de Lamartin and in the presence of the chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee in the National Assembly, Djema Grozdanova. More than an hour, Maria Gabriel talks to students in the 12th grade about the challenges and opportunities that Europe gives to the future development and uniqueness of the European project.
\r
"Active participation of young people in the public debate is of the utmost importance We can not make decisions about the future of young people without hearing what they want and what they dream about Europe can not afford to waste the talent and exclude young people "Young people should not only be architects of their own lives but also participate in positive change in our societies," said Gabriel Gabriel.
\r
It has placed a special place on the role and place of digital skills for the future development of young people in Europe. "The need for skills is more than urgent," said the EU commissioner, because without skills, young people can not find their realization and will not take advantage of the opportunities that digital transformation offers, "she said.
\r
The European Commission therefore supports research and innovation programs in the field of education to make the learning process more exciting and interesting.

The procurement also includes logistical provision and servicing of the devices at the sectional election commissions in the country, training of the staff in working with the equipment to conduct the elections for members of the European Parliament from the Republic of Bulgaria on 26.05.2019. The quantity of the special devices for electronic machine voting is 3,000 (three thousand). The maximum estimated value of the public procurement contract is BGN 7,500,000 (seven million five hundred thousand) excluding VAT.


The new figures emerge as the debate about immigration - both legal and illegal - across the European continent rages on, encouraged by incidents like that which occurred in Malta recently where a group of teenage African migrants were arrested after attempting to hijack an oil tanker.
It has been revealed that at least one million migrants from sub-Saharan Africa have made their way to Europe since 2010, according to the Daily Mail which cites new Pew Research Center findings.
According to the Mail, Pew says that approximately 970,000 migrants from the region were able to legally settle on the European continent between the years 2010 and 2017. Yet, they add that the numbers have been steadily increasing since 2010, meaning that it is more than likely the number of arrivals exceeds one million.
The African migrants pursue a number of means to legal settlement in Europe. Yet, according to Pew, the most common method is by an international student visa, following which they are able to apply for permanent settlements as refugees, typically through sponsorship by a family member who already resides on the continent.

Another new poll shows that people living in Sub-Saharan Africa have said that they would move to another country, preferably a European one, if given the chance. In one poll, carried out at the end of March 2019, 75% of the total polled, with Majorities in countries like Ghana, Tunisia, Nigeria and Senegal said that they plan on turning those ambitions into actions by leaving their countries within the next five years. Countries which house the most migrants from the region include the UK, which is said to have about 1.27 million, France — 980,000, Italy — 370,000 and Portugal — 360,000.
The development EU has been experiencing a massive migration crisis since 2015 due to the influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing their home countries in the Middle East and North Africa.
Relocation of migrants within the bloc has caused tensions within EU countries, with Malta, in particular, reaching an agreement with eight EU states to relocate migrants stranded off its coast on charity vessels after sea rescue operations.

DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) — China\'s prime minister has promised that Beijing will respect European standards and fair trade, seeking to allay concerns that it\'s flouting EU competition rules with huge investments on the continent.
Opening an annual summit of Eastern and Central European nations and China, Li Keqiang said "we intend to fully respect European standards."
Beijing has also been criticized for failing to give reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
He adds "we welcome openness and we want to treat all companies that operate in China equally and to increase imports from the (European) countries."
EU member Croatia is hosting a two-day summit between China and 16 regional countries on expanding business between China and the region, dubbed 16+1.


European court: Russia\'s house arrest of Navalny unlawful
MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
Navalny, a leading opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed Tuesday\'s ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled Tuesday that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."

NORWALK — In American classrooms, teachers not only focus on core subjects such as art, math and science. There’s also emphasis on enhancing students’ vision, courage and social-emotional responsibility.
In Germany, the spotlight is on comprehending core subjects. Days are shorter but more intense, with some primary school students attending class from around 8:30 a.m. to noon. Electives or extra-curriculars such as music, art and sports aren’t weighed as heavily in a student’s grade as are math, science or language arts.
But as the country advances with the rest of the world and becomes less homogenous — with refugees and immigrants moving in — there’s a push to reshape the face of academics, said Gabi Weigand, a professor in Karlsruhe, a city in southwestern Germany.
She visited Connecticut schools in Hartford, Granby and Mansfield this week and came to Norwalk on Friday afternoon to learn how to successfully incorporate a gifted and talented program in German schools. A professor of more than 10 years, she learned alongside Joseph Renzulli, co-founder of the schoolwide enrichment model, active in thousands of schools across the country including in Norwalk. The more than 40-year-old model provides opportunities and resources for teachers to encourage all children to develop their strengths, interests and talents, Renzulli said.
“The gifted and talented historically has mainly been based on test scores, so IQ tests or achievement tests,” Renzulli said. “We certainly have some children that are traditionally high achievers, but we want to make adjustments in the regular curriculum, so they don’t get bored to death. At the time, I also have taken a very big lead in the idea of extending this approach to learning, so all kids have those kinds of opportunities.”
His “three E’s” theory is, enjoyment leads to engagement which insights enthusiasm about learning. In his research, he’s found, creativity and task commitment, are important factors in student success.
“I think these are the kinds of things that really cause the brain to work in many, many different ways,” he said. “You don’t have to be the smartest kid in the class to have these things.”
Weigand is bringing this educational approach to 300 kindergarten-through-high school buildings in Germany looking to foster a gifted and talented program. Her quest started a year ago after she was named chief of research in a project that envisions developing the program in the schools within five years. The 120 million euros of funding for the project supports the work Weigand, students and 28 scientists are doing.
“We know the Renzulli model but what we see here (in Norwalk) is how they practice it,” Weigand said. “What is new for us is this spirit of the schools, a spirit you can feel in the cooperation of the teachers, the staff, the principals (that) are supporting it and the administration. This is amazing for us because it’s important to have these attitudes, these perspectives to want to foster every child, every student.”
The collaboration between Renzulli and Weigand formed with the help of Victor Mueller-Oppliger, a professor in northwestern Switzerland and longtime colleague of Renzulli. He brought the schoolwide enrichment model to the Switzerland in 2003 following a sabbatical in Connecticut where he worked with Renzulli. The curriculum is now present in about 600 Swiss schools.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has left its policy promises and interest rates unchanged as it weighs looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
The ECB has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve in pausing the withdrawal of stimulus measures deployed over a decade to bounce back from the global financial crisis, as central bankers around the world ponder which way the economy is headed. The Fed has already started raising rates but has backed off plans for further rate increases in 2019.
The ECB\'s 25-member governing council was content to stand pat on Thursday, making no changes to its short policy statement. The bank took several steps to support the economy on March 7. Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.
The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4 percent, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year — if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3 percent for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8 percent from a peak of 12.1 percent in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3 percent from 3.5 percent.
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.

BERLIN (AP) — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.


European researchers to drill for ancient Antarctic ice
BERLIN (AP) — A group of 14 European scientific institutions plan to retrieve the world\'s oldest ice as part of research into past climate change.
The consortium led by the Germany-based Alfred Wegener Institute said Tuesday it has identified an area in Antarctica, nicknamed "Little Dome C," that should harbor ice as old as 1.5 million years.
So-called ice core measurements are crucial for scientists\' understanding of past climatic changes on Earth and the models they use to predict future global warming or cooling.
Current ice core measurements provide reliable data going back only about 800,000 years.
At a meeting in Vienna, the institutes said they spent the past three years working with American, Australian, Japanese and Russian colleagues using radar to determine the best possible site for drilling.

China\'s spreading influence in Eastern Europe worries West

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members — or those hoping to join — could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.
Of the 16 participating countries — Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia — 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A new professional league for elite swimmers will debut this year with U.S. and foreign teams competing in a mixed gender format with the athletes being paid.
Five-time Olympic champion Katie Ledecky will compete for one of the International Swimming League\'s eight teams — four based in the U.S. and four in Europe.
Ledecky said the league "represents a new era for professional swimming."
"Especially for competitive women like me," she said Tuesday. "Jumping in the pool for the ISL really means a new era for women since it\'s one of the first leagues to emphasize gender equality as one of its values."
Besides Ledecky, fellow Americans Nathan Adrian, Simone Manuel and Ryan Murphy have been tabbed as ambassadors. They\'re expected to both compete and help promote the inaugural season.
The ISL won\'t begin until after this summer\'s world championships in South Korea, while a planned 2020 season would start after the Tokyo Olympics.
Founded by Ukrainian financier Konstantin Grigorishin, the league will launch Oct. 4-5, with meets held nearly every weekend through Nov. 24. The league championship will be in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay in a temporary pool on Dec. 20-21. The racing will be in short-course meters rather than the long-course format used in the Olympics.
"The show that is going to go around it will be quite a production, very fan-oriented," former Olympic medalist Kaitlin Sandeno said.
The U.S. will be represented by: the New York Breakers, the Los Angeles Current, the DC Trident, and the Cali Condors based in San Francisco.
The Breakers will be overseen by general manager Tina Andrew, mother and manager of swimmer Michael Andrew. The Current will be led by retired Olympic backstroke champion Lenny Krayzelburg, the Condors by retired four-time Olympic champion Jason Lezak, and the Trident by Sandeno.
The European teams will be based in London, Rome, Budapest and likely France.
Full rosters will be announced in the coming weeks.
Swimmers will compete for team points in various styles of races, with 12 men and 12 women on each team. The ISL said numerous Olympic champions and world record holders will participate.
"There\'s something about competing for a team title," five-time Olympic champion Adrian said. "It\'s a different kind of energy than what swimmers are used to."
The ISL will have a zero tolerance doping policy and won\'t allow any swimmer with a previous doping violation to participate.
Swimmers will sign two contracts: one with their team and another with the ISL. Revenue will flow from the clubs and the league to the athletes. Grigorishin said revenue will be split 50-50 between the league and swimmers.
"We have one of the hardest working athletes in the sports world and they deserve more than we have gotten so far," Krayzelburg said. "It\'s going to change the landscape, create more exposure and opportunities for our athletes and put the sport of swimming on the forefront, not just in the Olympic year."
Currently, professional swimmers have the TYR Pro Swim Series in the U.S. and the FINA World Cup between August and November in Europe, Asia and the Middle East in which they compete for prize money.
The ISL has overcome roadblocks to its formation, having filed a federal antitrust lawsuit last year against FINA, the sport\'s international governing body.
FINA announced its own Champions Swim Series made up of invitation-only meets in Guangzhou, Budapest and Indianapolis in April and May. Total prize money is $3.9 million and the competitions will include some of the sport\'s biggest names.
"We have no principle conflict with FINA," Grigorishin said. "FINA should be responsible for the whole swimming world. The league is just for the elite swimmers. Somebody has to regulate and set up the rules in swimming. If you are a regulator, you should not be organizer of competition. In the future, FINA will have to make a choice."
Grigorishin said negotiations with global broadcasting outlets are ongoing.


European researchers to drill for ancient Antarctic ice
BERLIN (AP) — A group of 14 European scientific institutions plan to retrieve the world\'s oldest ice as part of research into past climate change.
The consortium led by the Germany-based Alfred Wegener Institute said Tuesday it has identified an area in Antarctica, nicknamed "Little Dome C," that should harbor ice as old as 1.5 million years.
So-called ice core measurements are crucial for scientists\' understanding of past climatic changes on Earth and the models they use to predict future global warming or cooling.
Current ice core measurements provide reliable data going back only about 800,000 years.
At a meeting in Vienna, the institutes said they spent the past three years working with American, Australian, Japanese and Russian colleagues using radar to determine the best possible site for drilling.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members — or those hoping to join — could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.
Of the 16 participating countries — Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia — 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

European court: Russia\'s house arrest of Navalny unlawful
MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
Navalny, a leading opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed Tuesday\'s ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled Tuesday that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict.

BERLIN (AP) — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.
___
1:50 p.m.
The European Central Bank has kept its policy promises, interest rates and stimulus settings unchanged as officials weigh looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a news conference Thursday, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more monetary stimulus in coming months. Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for an interest rate increase from the end of the year into next year.

DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) — China\'s prime minister has promised that Beijing will respect European standards and fair trade, seeking to allay concerns that it\'s flouting EU competition rules with huge investments on the continent.
Opening an annual summit of Eastern and Central European nations and China, Li Keqiang said "we intend to fully respect European standards."
Beijing has also been criticized for failing to give reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
He adds "we welcome openness and we want to treat all companies that operate in China equally and to increase imports from the (European) countries."

April 9 (UPI) -- The Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group has entered European waters after leaving its former homeport in Norfolk, Va., last week.
The Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, along with its carrier air wing, Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Leyte Gulf, and destroyers USS Bainbridge, USS Mason and USS Nitzey, entered the European theater Monday, according to a Naval news release.
The strike group left Naval Station Norfolk on April 1. Two other aircraft carriers, the USS Harry S. Truman and the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, departed within hours of each other three days earlier.
The Alvaro de Bazan-class Spanish frigate ESPS Mendez Nunez also joined the Truman strike group.
RELATED USS Eisenhower back at sea after upgrades in Norfolk
"We live in a complex and rapidly changing world, and today I\'m exceptionally proud to be leading the Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group as we get underway in support of our Navy and our nation," Rear Adm. John Wade, commander, of the strike group, said in a news release after departing form Norfolk.
"This team of teams, with her ships, aircraft and over 6,000 sailors, serves as a visible and powerful symbol of the U.S. Navy\'s commitment to carrying out any mission our nation calls us to do, anywhere around the globe."
In January, the Lincoln group left Norfolk to participate in composite training unit exercise, or COMPTUEX, a series of operations and scenarios meant to help the seven-vessel group achieve certification for deployment.
"The Abraham Lincoln Strike Group has worked tremendously hard to prepare for our operations in U.S. 6th Fleet," said Rear Adm. John Wade, commander of Abraham Lincoln CSG. "We are poised and ready to perform our mission."
The Lincoln CSG will participate in realistic training "to increase the capabilities of the U.S. allies and strengthen partnerships through multi-lateral events honing the skills necessary to achieve maritime superiority through presence," according to the news release.
The U.S. and Spanish vessels first will travel to Gibraltar and then pass through the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, Persian Gulf, Indian Ocean, South China Sea and Pacific Ocean. The Lincoln then will head to San Diego, its new home port.
The Lincoln completed its most recent deployment in 2012.
In 2013, the carrier underwent overhaul for four years, including preparing the ship to accommodate F-35C fighters.
The Lincoln was commissioned Nov. 11, 1989, as the fifth Nimitz-class aircraft carrier.
The Truman was the last carrier in the European theater last year, according to Stars & Stripes with deployments as part of "dynamic force employment," meaning they operated in unpredictable patterns.
The USS Harry S. Truman departed Norfolk for proficiency drills and testing of the new the Grumman C-2 Greyhound aircraft.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A new professional league for elite swimmers will debut this year with U.S. and foreign teams competing in a mixed gender format with the athletes being paid.
Five-time Olympic champion Katie Ledecky will compete for one of the International Swimming League\'s eight teams — four based in the U.S. and four in Europe.
Ledecky said the league "represents a new era for professional swimming."
"Especially for competitive women like me," she said Tuesday. "Jumping in the pool for the ISL really means a new era for women since it\'s one of the first leagues to emphasize gender equality as one of its values."
Besides Ledecky, fellow Americans Nathan Adrian, Simone Manuel and Ryan Murphy have been tabbed as ambassadors. They\'re expected to both compete and help promote the inaugural season.
The ISL won\'t begin until after this summer\'s world championships in South Korea, while a planned 2020 season would start after the Tokyo Olympics.
Founded by Ukrainian financier Konstantin Grigorishin, the league will launch Oct. 4-5, with meets held nearly every weekend through Nov. 24. The league championship will be in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay in a temporary pool on Dec. 20-21. The racing will be in short-course meters rather than the long-course format used in the Olympics.
"The show that is going to go around it will be quite a production, very fan-oriented," former Olympic medalist Kaitlin Sandeno said.
The U.S. will be represented by: the New York Breakers, the Los Angeles Current, the DC Trident, and the Cali Condors based in San Francisco.
The Breakers will be overseen by general manager Tina Andrew, mother and manager of swimmer Michael Andrew. The Current will be led by retired Olympic backstroke champion Lenny Krayzelburg, the Condors by retired four-time Olympic champion Jason Lezak, and the Trident by Sandeno.
The European teams will be based in London, Rome, Budapest and likely France.
Full rosters will be announced in the coming weeks.
Swimmers will compete for team points in various styles of races, with 12 men and 12 women on each team. The ISL said numerous Olympic champions and world record holders will participate.
"There\'s something about competing for a team title," five-time Olympic champion Adrian said. "It\'s a different kind of energy than what swimmers are used to."
The ISL will have a zero tolerance doping policy and won\'t allow any swimmer with a previous doping violation to participate.
Swimmers will sign two contracts: one with their team and another with the ISL. Revenue will flow from the clubs and the league to the athletes. Grigorishin said revenue will be split 50-50 between the league and swimmers.
"We have one of the hardest working athletes in the sports world and they deserve more than we have gotten so far," Krayzelburg said. "It\'s going to change the landscape, create more exposure and opportunities for our athletes and put the sport of swimming on the forefront, not just in the Olympic year."
Currently, professional swimmers have the TYR Pro Swim Series in the U.S. and the FINA World Cup between August and November in Europe, Asia and the Middle East in which they compete for prize money.
The ISL has overcome roadblocks to its formation, having filed a federal antitrust lawsuit last year against FINA, the sport\'s international governing body.
FINA announced its own Champions Swim Series made up of invitation-only meets in Guangzhou, Budapest and Indianapolis in April and May. Total prize money is $3.9 million and the competitions will include some of the sport\'s biggest names.
"We have no principle conflict with FINA," Grigorishin said. "FINA should be responsible for the whole swimming world. The league is just for the elite swimmers. Somebody has to regulate and set up the rules in swimming. If you are a regulator, you should not be organizer of competition. In the future, FINA will have to make a choice."
Grigorishin said negotiations with global broadcasting outlets are ongoing.

China\'s spreading influence in Eastern Europe worries West

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members — or those hoping to join — could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.
Of the 16 participating countries — Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia — 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

BERLIN (AP) — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.
___
1:50 p.m.
The European Central Bank has kept its policy promises, interest rates and stimulus settings unchanged as officials weigh looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a news conference Thursday, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more monetary stimulus in coming months. Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for an interest rate increase from the end of the year into next year.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has left its policy promises and interest rates unchanged as it weighs looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
The ECB has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve in pausing the withdrawal of stimulus measures deployed over a decade to bounce back from the global financial crisis, as central bankers around the world ponder which way the economy is headed. The Fed has already started raising rates but has backed off plans for further rate increases in 2019.
The ECB\'s 25-member governing council was content to stand pat on Thursday, making no changes to its short policy statement. The bank took several steps to support the economy on March 7. Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.
The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4%, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year — if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3% for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8% from a peak of 12.1% in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3% from 3.5%.
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."


Last week, I wrote about Jason Hickel\'s romantic idea that people in the past "lived well" with little or no monetary income. I noted that prior to the Industrial Revolution, clothing was immensely expensive and uncomfortable. The cotton mills changed all that.
As a French historian noted in 1846, "Machine production...brings within the reach of the poor a world of useful objects, even luxurious and artistic objects, which they could never reach before."
Today, I wish to turn to pollution.
Let\'s start with air quality. In the 17th century London, Claire Tomalin observed in Samuel Pepys: The Unequalled Self, "Every household burnt coal ... The smoke from their chimneys made the air dark, covering every surface with sooty grime. There were days when a cloud of smoke half a mile high and twenty miles wide could be seen over the city ...."
In a similar vein, Carlo Cipolla in his book Before the Industrial Revolution: European Society and Economy 1000-1700, quotes from the diary of British writer John Evelyn, who wrote in 1661:
The streets were just as dirty. John Harrington invented the toilet in 1596, but bathrooms remained rare luxuries two hundred years later. Chamber pots continued to be emptied into streets, turning them into sewers. To make matters worse, even large towns continued to engage in husbandry well into the 18th century. As Fernand Braudel noted in The Structures of Everyday Life,
Lawrence Stone observed in The Family, Sex and Marriage in England 1500-1800 that "In towns in the eighteenth century, the city ditches, now often filled with stagnant water, were commonly used as latrines;
A "special problem" in London, Stone wrote, was the "poor holes" or "large, deep, open pits in which were laid the bodies of the poor, side by side, row by row. Only when the pit was filled with bodies was it finally covered with earth." As one contemporary writer, whom Stone quotes, observed, "How noisome the stench is that arises from these holes."
According to Stone, "
Then there was "the prevalence of intestinal worms," which is "a slow, disgusting and debilitating disease that caused a vast amount of human misery and ill health ... In the many poorly drained marshy areas, recurrent malarial fevers were common and debilitating diseases ... [and] perhaps even more heart-breaking was the slow, inexorable, destructive power of tuberculosis."
The situation was no better on the European mainland. In the middle of the 17th century, Queen Anne of Austria and mother of Louis XIV noted that "Paris is a horrible place and ill smelling.
In the 19th century, pollution remained a problem. In Inside the Victorian Home: A Portrait of Domestic Life in Victorian England, Judith Flanders noted Waldo Emerson\'s observation that "no one ... [in England] wore white because it was impossible to keep it clean." According to Flanders, hair brushes looked "black after once using" and tablecloths were laid just before eating, "as otherwise dust settled from the fire and they became dingy in a matter of hours."
In 1858, the stench from the River Thames was so bad that "the curtains on the river side of the building were soaked in lime chloride to overcome the smell". The effort was unsuccessful, with Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli once fleeing a committee room "with a mass of papers in one hand, and with his pocket handkerchief applied to his nose," because the stench was so bad. He called the river "a Stygian pool, reeking with ineffable and intolerable horrors."
Keep in mind that even after the Industrial Revolution had begun, much of the pollution was still non-industrial. Henry Mayhew, an English social researcher and journalist, found that the Thames contained "ingredients from breweries, gasworks, and chemical and mineral manufactories; dead dogs, cats, and kittens, fats, offal from slaughterhouses; street-pavement dirt of every variety; vegetable refuse; stable-dung; the refuse of pig-styes; night-soil; ashes; tin kettles and pans ... broken stoneware, jars, pitchers, flower-pots, etc.; pieces of wood; rotten mortar and rubbish of different kinds."
Fast-forward to 2015 and the BBC reported "more than 2,000 seals have been spotted in the Thames over the past decade ... along with hundreds of porpoises and dolphins and even the odd stray whale ... There are now 125 species of fish in the Thames, up from almost none in the 1950s." Similarly, average concentrations of suspended particulate matter in London rose from 390 in 1800 to a peak of 623 in 1891, before falling to 16 micrograms per cubic meters in 2016. Today, air in the capital of the United Kingdom ranks as one of the cleanest among the world\'s major cities.

Snowmaggedon in Passo Tonale, NW Italy with 150 cm+ snow in the past 48 hours! Report: @wePowder pic.twitter.com/sqCIMO3Z8i \xe2\x80\x94 severe-weather.EU (@severeweatherEU) April 5, 2019
The last couple of weeks saw a mix of snow and weather conditions across the western US with good falls in Colorado on the last weekend of March while California also saw out March with some nice powder after a 40cm snowfall on March 29.
Of course, after the huge amounts of snow in February, most resorts in the US have a very deep snowpack and the spring skiing has been excellent. After a couple of days of sunshine,
Further inland, the Utah resorts had light snowfalls earlier this week with 5-10cms while Colorado also received 10-15cms over a two to three- day period. Jackson Hole could see some fresh turns on offer for the final weekend of the season with 10-15cms forecast before lifts close for the season on Sunday.
There will also be a few snow showers across the weekend in the Sierras while a stronger system could see significant falls in Utah and Colorado for a few mid-week powder turns.
After a week of sunshine and good spring skiing conditions, it looks like some decent snow is heading for WhistlerThe snow level will start between the village and mid-station before colder temps see the snow level drop to the village. There will be plenty of snow in the alpine and upper trees some good powder likely on the upper mountain.
Revelstoke saw 25cms in the past week of March, but it has also been sunny for the past few days. Unfortunately, the storm due to hit the Coast mountains over the next three days won\'t make it further inland with just a few snow showers and possible rain for interior BC over the weekend.
Over in Banff, Lake Louise has turned on some excellent spring conditions over the past week with cold nights and sunny days. The groomers have been perfect, with good spring snow off piste, but the fine weather is coming to an end with a weak change set to bring a few snow showers over the weekend.
After an early spring it has been all about the powder on Honshu this week, with Myoko and Hakuba seeing very good falls and some deep, winter powder. Mountainwatch snow reporter Steve Lee covered it succinctly in his Hakuba report on Wednesday: "It\'s full on gluttony here in Hakuba, we will be eating face shots all day! More of that on the way today
The storms that delivered all the powder Honshu were too far south for the Hokkaido resorts with Niseko receiving just a couple of centimetres in the past 48 hours while Furano has seen mainly fine spring weather. It is getting towards the end of the season with Niseko Village and Hanazano closing this Sunday although lifts will be open in Annapuri and Grand Hirafu until May 6. Similarly lifts will be open in Furano until May 6 while Hakuba will also have lifts spinning until the end of the first week of May.
After a week of sunshine and classic spring skiing conditions with a melt/freeze cycle,
Most regions will see decent snowfalls and while some smaller resorts have closed most resorts in France, Austria and Switzerland are open for the next one to three weeks.before clearing over the weekend.
It\'s looking good too, with the French resorts expecting 20-50cms, parts of Austria up to 60cms on the upper slopes while accumulations up to 80cms are possible for the Dolomites.

Italy\'s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said on Friday he would host a major rally of European nationalist and far-right parties to promote a shared political vision ahead of May\'s EU parliamentary elections.
Salvini leads the ruling League party and hopes to put together a bloc of like-minded, anti-immigration parties in the European parliament to challenge the traditionally predominant and mainstream centre-left and centre-right groups.
However he has so far struggled to create a broad, sovereignist front in the 28-nation European Union, with a matrix of conflicting national interests hindering his progress.
With time running out, he announced this week he would kick off his campaign for the May 26 vote in Milan on Monday with representatives of just three, relatively small far-right European parties.
But speaking after talks with his longtime French ally Marine Le Pen, Salvini told reporters he planned a much more ambitious election rally next month.
"We\'re preparing a major event for the Europe of the next 30 years in May in Italy, where we\'ll invite all the European movements that are alternatives to the rule of the Socialists and the European People\'s Party of recent years," Salvini said, referring to the EU\'s big leftist and conservative groups.
"It will be the first time an event drawing together at least 15 or 20 European countries will take place in Italy," he told reporters in Paris.
Salvini did not say what other parties had signed up to the initiative, which the League hopes to hold in Rome\'s ancient chariot-racing stadium Circus Maximus.
European parties have created multiple, pan-national groups in the EU parliament, with the League a member of the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF), which includes Le Pen\'s National Rally and Austria\'s Freedom Party of Austria.
Salvini wants to embrace other far-right or nationalist leaders whose parties are in different groups, such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of Poland\'s ruling PiS party.
Kaczynski met Salvini in January, but PiS, which is highly suspicious of the close ties Le Pen and Salvini have forged with Moscow, said on Friday it would not join the May rally.
"We met (Salvini) a few weeks ago and we spelt out our conditions when it comes to the European parliament. We do not envisage any further contact until after the election," said Tomasz Poreba, PiS\'s EU ballot campaign chief.
Making clear its preferences, PiS this week welcomed Salvini\'s old ally, the Brothers of Italy, into its EU group - the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe.
"We are the real sovereignists. They are populists," Brothers of Italy leader Giorgia Meloni told La Stampa newspaper on Thursday, referring to the League. "I don\'t think Salvini\'s project is very clear about what it wants with Europe."
Salvini said the three groups that would be joining him on Monday were the anti-europarty, the conservativeand the
AfD co-leader Joerg Meuthen told La Stampa newspaper on Friday that although he and Salvini had similar, anti-immigrant views, they had different positions on key economic questions, like the need to respect EU fiscal rules.
"We cannot agree on everything. We will talk about it and find compromises," he was quoted as saying.

If Russia is forced to leave the Council of Europe around the same time the UK leaves the EU, it will have disastrous consequences for the continent, Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Thorbjorn Jagland, has warned.
"I believe. However, it can happen soon," he told Norwegian news agency NTB, about the possibility of Russia leaving the organization this summer.
Jagland also maintained that(PACE), which it was deprived of following Russia\'s reunification with Crimea.
Back in 2014, after Crimea reunited with Russia as a result of the referendum - a move that European nations treated as "annexation" - Moscow\'s delegation was stripped of its voting rights in PACE as well as being deprived of the right to take part in the Council of Europe\'s (CE) monitoring missions or joining the PACE ruling bodies, under rules that Russia called "politically motivated" and "discriminatory."
Since that time, Moscow has sought the full reinstatement of its delegation\'s rights, as well as a change of the "discriminatory" regulations. In 2015, PACE reviewed the issue twiceagainst the Russian delegation.
This development prompted Moscow to first cease its participation in the PACE sessions and, eventually, to stop paying its instalments to the Council of Europe back in 2017. The move sparked another row between Russia and the CE as.
In 2017, Russia contributed \xe2\x82\xac33 million ($37.07 million) to the CE budget out of a total of \xe2\x82\xac454 million ($509.96 million). Moscow\'s decision forced the CE to freeze nine percent of its budget expenditures and still left the organization with a deficit of \xe2\x82\xac1.5 million ($1.68 million).
In early 2019, the Russian State Duma and the Senate both passed resolutions, that Russia will not send a delegation to PACE nor would it pay its instalments to the CE this year, because of the continued discrimination.
If a CE member state does not pay its fees for two years, it can be expelled from the organization. For Russia, this deadline expires on July 1. M
On Friday, the head of the Russian Senate\'s International Relations Committee, Konstantin Kosachev, said that Russia "entertains a possibility of leaving the Council of Europe."
Although Jagland lamented the fact that Russia has not paid its instalments to the organization\'s budget, he still admitted that the treatment of the Russian delegation to PACE was unfair; he said that a nation could be stripped of its voting rights only if it decides to leave the Council of Europe or is excluded from it by decision of the CE\'s ministerial committee. It\'s a change from his October statements, that Russia should face additional sanctions if it does not resume its payments to the CE.
Earlier this week, the secretary general also presented his draft of a new agreement that would create a more solid cooperation framework for the CE members and would resolve the crisis in relations between the Council of Europe and Russia. The draft accord includes four points and particularly guarantees equal rights to all national delegations, regardless of any circumstances, while declaring that participation in the CE\'s intergovernmental structures, such as PACE, is not a privilege but a "responsibility."

Italy\'s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said on Friday he would host a major rally of European nationalist and far-right parties to promote a shared political vision ahead of May\'s EU parliamentary elections.
Salvini leads the ruling League party and hopes to put together a bloc of like-minded, anti-immigration parties in the European parliament to challenge the traditionally predominant and mainstream centre-left and centre-right groups.
However he has so far struggled to create a broad, sovereignist front in the 28-nation European Union, with a matrix of conflicting national interests hindering his progress.
With time running out, he announced this week he would kick off his campaign for the May 26 vote in Milan on Monday with representatives of just three, relatively small far-right European parties.
But speaking after talks with his longtime French ally Marine Le Pen, Salvini told reporters he planned a much more ambitious election rally next month.
"We\'re preparing a major event for the Europe of the next 30 years in May in Italy, where we\'ll invite all the European movements that are alternatives to the rule of the Socialists and the European People\'s Party of recent years," Salvini said, referring to the EU\'s big leftist and conservative groups.
"It will be the first time an event drawing together at least 15 or 20 European countries will take place in Italy," he told reporters in Paris.
Salvini did not say what other parties had signed up to the initiative, which the League hopes to hold in Rome\'s ancient chariot-racing stadium Circus Maximus.
European parties have created multiple, pan-national groups in the EU parliament, with the League a member of the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF), which includes Le Pen\'s National Rally and Austria\'s Freedom Party of Austria.
Salvini wants to embrace other far-right or nationalist leaders whose parties are in different groups, such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of Poland\'s ruling PiS party.
Kaczynski met Salvini in January, but PiS, which is highly suspicious of the close ties Le Pen and Salvini have forged with Moscow, said on Friday it would not join the May rally.
"We met (Salvini) a few weeks ago and we spelt out our conditions when it comes to the European parliament. We do not envisage any further contact until after the election," said Tomasz Poreba, PiS\'s EU ballot campaign chief.
Making clear its preferences, PiS this week welcomed Salvini\'s old ally, the Brothers of Italy, into its EU group - the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe.
"We are the real sovereignists. They are populists," Brothers of Italy leader Giorgia Meloni told La Stampa newspaper on Thursday, referring to the League. "I don\'t think Salvini\'s project is very clear about what it wants with Europe."
Salvini said the three groups that would be joining him on Monday were the anti-europarty, the conservativeand the
AfD co-leader Joerg Meuthen told La Stampa newspaper on Friday that although he and Salvini had similar, anti-immigrant views, they had different positions on key economic questions, like the need to respect EU fiscal rules.
"We cannot agree on everything. We will talk about it and find compromises," he was quoted as saying.

Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan’s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that “the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people.”
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn’t be at war.
The pontiff said that “a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It’s us that make a difference.”

Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said on Wednesday European powers were incapable of bypassing sanctions imposed on Tehran by the US after it withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal.
Iran and six world powers agreed on a deal in 2015 that severely restricted Tehran’s nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief and economic incentives.
However President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from the deal - technically called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - last May, re-imposing punishing sanctions on the Islamic republic.
The other parties to the nuclear deal - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia along with the European Union - however insist they remain committed to making the deal work.
“The Europeans at first viewed the JCPOA (nuclear deal) as an achievement, but maybe they were not prepared to, and certainly they were not capable of standing up against US sanctions,” Zarif said in an interview with Khamenei.ir, the official website of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
“We will continue pressing the Europeans to implement their commitments. Europe must know that they cannot shy away from their responsibilities with a few statements and some unaccomplished plans,” he added.
Zarif, who was his country’s chief negotiator in the negotiations leading to the deal, said that Iran would continue to pressure the Europeans to act on their obligations within the deal but added that “we never had any hopes” in them.
Instead of the western powers the Islamic republic has turned to its traditional partners such as Russia and China, Zarif said, adding “the future of our foreign policy lies in that way.”

The United States and five European countries on Thursday called for a UN Security Council meeting on Sudan after president Omar al-Bashir was ousted by the army, diplomats said.
The council is expected to discuss the situation in Sudan during a closed-door meeting on Friday that was also requested by France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and Poland.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a transition in Sudan that will meet the “democratic aspirations” of the people, his spokesman said.
Guterres appealed for “calm and utmost restraint by all.”
Egypt expressed its “complete support” on Thursday for the Sudanese people and their army in the political transition to come, following the ouster of al-Bashir.
Cairo voiced its full belief in “the ability of the brotherly Sudanese people and their loyal national army to overcome the challenges of this critical stage... in order to achieve stability, prosperity and development,” a foreign ministry statement said.

The foreign ministry stressed that Egypt respects Sudan’s sovereignty and its national decisions, reiterating its backing of the country’s march towards “stability and prosperity”.
Meanwhile, the African Union on Thursday criticized the military ouster of Sudan’s veteran president al-Bashir and called for calm and restraint.
“The military takeover is not the appropriate response to the challenges facing Sudan and the aspirations of its people,” said a statement from Moussa Faki, chairman of the AU Commission, in Addis Ababa.
Erdogan calls for national reconciliation
In Ankara, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called on Thursday for national reconciliation in Sudan.
Erdogan, who has deepened Turkey’s investments in Sudan recently, said the two countries had deep relations that Ankara wanted to maintain.
“My wish is that Sudan should succeed in this calmly ... and I believe it should start operating the normal democratic process,” he told a news conference in Ankara.
“It is my most important wish that Sudan gets over this process on the basis of national reconciliation and in peace.”
Erdogan became the first Turkish president to visit Khartoum in 2017, when Turkey signed several deals worth $650 million with Sudan as it emerged from two decades of US sanctions.

The European Parliament on Thursday approved a law allowing Britons visa-free EU visits even after a “no deal” Brexit, despite a furious dispute over the status of Gibraltar.
The law means British visitors making trips of fewer than 90 days to the Schengen passport-free zone will not need visas, even if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal in place.
The parliament approved the measure by 502 votes to 81, with 29 abstentions, paving the way for millions of British holidaymakers to flock to the beaches of the Mediterranean this summer regardless of the outcome of Brexit.
Implementation will depend on Britain granting EU citizens the same rights in return, but London has said it will do so and the principle of the law has broad support.
But the text of legislation itself triggered a bitter row in Brussels, after member states -- at Spain’s urging -- referred in a footnote to the draft to Gibraltar as a “colony of the British crown”.
The United Nations does legally list Gibraltar as a “non-self-governing territory”, but Britain insists it is part of “the UK family” and that its citizens freely voted to remain British.
Britain’s decision to leave the EU has revived controversy over Spain’s long-standing claim on the territory, against the backdrop of Spanish elections.

BERLIN (AP) — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.


European researchers to drill for ancient Antarctic ice
BERLIN (AP) — A group of 14 European scientific institutions plan to retrieve the world\'s oldest ice as part of research into past climate change.
The consortium led by the Germany-based Alfred Wegener Institute said Tuesday it has identified an area in Antarctica, nicknamed "Little Dome C," that should harbor ice as old as 1.5 million years.
So-called ice core measurements are crucial for scientists\' understanding of past climatic changes on Earth and the models they use to predict future global warming or cooling.
Current ice core measurements provide reliable data going back only about 800,000 years.
At a meeting in Vienna, the institutes said they spent the past three years working with American, Australian, Japanese and Russian colleagues using radar to determine the best possible site for drilling.

European court: Russia\'s house arrest of Navalny unlawful
MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights ruled Tuesday that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
Navalny, a prominent opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed the ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities. It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 20,000 euros ($22,550) in damages.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict to the court\'s highest chamber.
It\'s the second time that the court has ruled against Russia in a matter of months. Last November, the court\'s highest chamber found that Russian authorities violated multiple human rights in detaining Navalny seven times from 2012 to 2014, and that two of the arrests were expressly aimed at "suppressing political pluralism."
It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 63,000 euros in damages, and called on Russia to fix legislation to "take due regard of the fundamental importance of the right to peaceful assembly."
Russia is obliged to carry out the court\'s rulings, which enforce the European Convention on Human Rights, but it has delayed implementing past rulings from the court and argued against them as encroaching on Russian judicial sovereignty.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.

1:50 p.m.
The European Central Bank has kept its policy promises, interest rates and stimulus settings unchanged as officials weigh looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a news conference Thursday, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more monetary stimulus in coming months. Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for an interest rate increase from the end of the year into next year.

China\'s spreading influence in Eastern Europe worries West

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members — or those hoping to join — could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.
Of the 16 participating countries — Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia — 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) — China\'s prime minister has promised that Beijing will respect European standards and fair trade, seeking to allay concerns that it\'s flouting EU competition rules with huge investments on the continent.
Opening an annual summit of Eastern and Central European nations and China, Li Keqiang said "we intend to fully respect European standards."
Beijing has also been criticized for failing to give reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
He adds "we welcome openness and we want to treat all companies that operate in China equally and to increase imports from the (European) countries."
EU member Croatia is hosting a two-day summit between China and 16 regional countries on expanding business between China and the region, dubbed 16+1.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has left its policy promises and interest rates unchanged as it weighs looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
The ECB has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve in pausing the withdrawal of stimulus measures deployed over a decade to bounce back from the global financial crisis, as central bankers around the world ponder which way the economy is headed. The Fed has already started raising rates but has backed off plans for further rate increases in 2019.
The ECB\'s 25-member governing council was content to stand pat on Thursday, making no changes to its short policy statement. The bank took several steps to support the economy on March 7. Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.
The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4 percent, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year — if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3 percent for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8 percent from a peak of 12.1 percent in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3 percent from 3.5 percent.
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.

FILE - In this Monday, Oct. 15, 2018 file photo, a container ship is loaded at the harbor in Hamburg, Germany. The United States is considering putting tariffs on $11 billion in EU goods per year to offset what it says are unfair European subsidies for planemaker Airbus. While the size of the potential tariffs is relatively small compared with the hundreds of billions of goods the U.S. and China are taxing in their trade war, it suggests a breakdown in talks with the EU over trade. less FILE - In this Monday, Oct. 15, 2018 file photo, a container ship is loaded at the harbor in Hamburg, Germany.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.

European court: Russia\'s house arrest of Navalny unlawful
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
Navalny, a leading opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed Tuesday\'s ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled Tuesday that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members — or those hoping to join — could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.
Of the 16 participating countries — Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia — 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

European researchers to drill for ancient Antarctic ice
BERLIN (AP) — A group of 14 European scientific institutions plan to retrieve the world\'s oldest ice as part of research into past climate change.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
The consortium led by the Germany-based Alfred Wegener Institute said Tuesday it has identified an area in Antarctica, nicknamed "Little Dome C," that should harbor ice as old as 1.5 million years.
So-called ice core measurements are crucial for scientists\' understanding of past climatic changes on Earth and the models they use to predict future global warming or cooling.
Current ice core measurements provide reliable data going back only about 800,000 years.
At a meeting in Vienna, the institutes said they spent the past three years working with American, Australian, Japanese and Russian colleagues using radar to determine the best possible site for drilling.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."

BERLIN (AP) — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.

BERLIN (AP) — A group of 14 European scientific institutions plan to retrieve the world\'s oldest ice as part of research into past climate change.
\t
The consortium led by the Germany-based Alfred Wegener Institute said Tuesday it has identified an area in Antarctica, nicknamed "Little Dome C," that should harbor ice as old as 1.5 million years.
\t
\t
So-called ice core measurements are crucial for scientists\' understanding of past climatic changes on Earth and the models they use to predict future global warming or cooling.
\t
Current ice core measurements provide reliable data going back only about 800,000 years.
\t
At a meeting in Vienna, the institutes said they spent the past three years working with American, Australian, Japanese and Russian colleagues using radar to determine the best possible site for drilling.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A new professional league for elite swimmers will debut this year with U.S. and foreign-based teams competing in a mixed gender format with athletes being paid.
\t
Five-time Olympic champion Katie Ledecky will compete for one of the International Swimming League\'s eight teams — four based in the U.S. and four in Europe.
\t
\t
The league said Tuesday that the season will begin Oct. 4-5, with meets held nearly every weekend through Nov. 24. The top four teams will compete in the finals in Las Vegas on Dec. 20-21.
\t
The U.S. will be represented by: the New York Breakers, the Los Angeles Current, the DC Trident, and the Cali Condors based in San Francisco.
\t
The European teams will be based in London, Rome, Budapest and likely France.

DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) — China\'s prime minister has promised that Beijing will respect European standards and fair trade, seeking to allay concerns that it\'s flouting EU competition rules with huge investments on the continent.
\t
\t
Opening an annual summit of Eastern and Central European nations and China, Li Keqiang said "we intend to fully respect European standards."
\t
\t
Beijing has also been criticized for failing to give reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
\t
He adds "we welcome openness and we want to treat all companies that operate in China equally and to increase imports from the (European) countries."
\t
EU member Croatia is hosting a two-day summit between China and 16 regional countries on expanding business between China and the region, dubbed 16+1.


\t
BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
\t
\t
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
\t
\t
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
\t
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members — or those hoping to join — could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
\t
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
\t
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.
\t
\t
Of the 16 participating countries — Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia — 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
\t
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
\t
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
\t
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
\t
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
\t
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
\t
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
\t
\t
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
\t
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
\t
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
\t
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
\t
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
\t
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
\t
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
\t
\t
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
\t
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights ruled Tuesday that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
\t
\t
Navalny, a prominent opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed the ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
\t
The court in Strasbourg ruled that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities. It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 20,000 euros ($22,550) in damages.
\t
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict to the court\'s highest chamber.
\t
It\'s the second time that the court has ruled against Russia in a matter of months. Last November, the court\'s highest chamber found that Russian authorities violated multiple human rights in detaining Navalny seven times from 2012 to 2014, and that two of the arrests were expressly aimed at "suppressing political pluralism."
\t
It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 63,000 euros in damages, and called on Russia to fix legislation to "take due regard of the fundamental importance of the right to peaceful assembly."
\t
Russia is obliged to carry out the court\'s rulings, which enforce the European Convention on Human Rights, but it has delayed implementing past rulings from the court and argued against them as encroaching on Russian judicial sovereignty.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
\t
2:45 p.m.
\t
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
\t
\t
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
\t
\t
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.
\t

\t

\t
The European Central Bank has kept its policy promises, interest rates and stimulus settings unchanged as officials weigh looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
\t
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
\t
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a news conference Thursday, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more monetary stimulus in coming months. Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for an interest rate increase from the end of the year into next year.

\t
FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has left its policy promises and interest rates unchanged as it weighs looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
\t
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
\t
\t
\t
The ECB has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve in pausing the withdrawal of stimulus measures deployed over a decade to bounce back from the global financial crisis, as central bankers around the world ponder which way the economy is headed. The Fed has already started raising rates but has backed off plans for further rate increases in 2019.
\t
The ECB\'s 25-member governing council was content to stand pat on Thursday, making no changes to its short policy statement. The bank took several steps to support the economy on March 7. Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
\t
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
\t
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.
\t
The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4%, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
\t
\t
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
\t
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year — if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3% for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8% from a peak of 12.1% in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
\t
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3% from 3.5%.
\t
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
\t
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A new professional league for elite swimmers will debut this year with U.S. and foreign teams competing in a mixed gender format with the athletes being paid.
Five-time Olympic champion Katie Ledecky will compete for one of the International Swimming League\'s eight teams — four based in the U.S. and four in Europe.
Ledecky said the league "represents a new era for professional swimming."
"Especially for competitive women like me," she said Tuesday. "Jumping in the pool for the ISL really means a new era for women since it\'s one of the first leagues to emphasize gender equality as one of its values."
Besides Ledecky, fellow Americans Nathan Adrian, Simone Manuel and Ryan Murphy have been tabbed as ambassadors. They\'re expected to both compete and help promote the inaugural season.
The ISL won\'t begin until after this summer\'s world championships in South Korea, while a planned 2020 season would start after the Tokyo Olympics.
Founded by Ukrainian financier Konstantin Grigorishin, the league will launch Oct. 4-5, with meets held nearly every weekend through Nov. 24. The league championship will be in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay in a temporary pool on Dec. 20-21. The racing will be in short-course meters rather than the long-course format used in the Olympics.
"The show that is going to go around it will be quite a production, very fan-oriented," former Olympic medalist Kaitlin Sandeno said.
The U.S. will be represented by: the New York Breakers, the Los Angeles Current, the DC Trident, and the Cali Condors based in San Francisco.
The Breakers will be overseen by general manager Tina Andrew, mother and manager of swimmer Michael Andrew. The Current will be led by retired Olympic backstroke champion Lenny Krayzelburg, the Condors by retired four-time Olympic champion Jason Lezak, and the Trident by Sandeno.
The European teams will be based in London, Rome, Budapest and likely France.
Full rosters will be announced in the coming weeks.
Swimmers will compete for team points in various styles of races, with 12 men and 12 women on each team. The ISL said numerous Olympic champions and world record holders will participate.
"There\'s something about competing for a team title," five-time Olympic champion Adrian said. "It\'s a different kind of energy than what swimmers are used to."
The ISL will have a zero tolerance doping policy and won\'t allow any swimmer with a previous doping violation to participate.
Swimmers will sign two contracts: one with their team and another with the ISL. Revenue will flow from the clubs and the league to the athletes. Grigorishin said revenue will be split 50-50 between the league and swimmers.
"We have one of the hardest working athletes in the sports world and they deserve more than we have gotten so far," Krayzelburg said. "It\'s going to change the landscape, create more exposure and opportunities for our athletes and put the sport of swimming on the forefront, not just in the Olympic year."
Currently, professional swimmers have the TYR Pro Swim Series in the U.S. and the FINA World Cup between August and November in Europe, Asia and the Middle East in which they compete for prize money.
The ISL has overcome roadblocks to its formation, having filed a federal antitrust lawsuit last year against FINA, the sport\'s international governing body.
FINA announced its own Champions Swim Series made up of invitation-only meets in Guangzhou, Budapest and Indianapolis in April and May. Total prize money is $3.9 million and the competitions will include some of the sport\'s biggest names.
"We have no principle conflict with FINA," Grigorishin said. "FINA should be responsible for the whole swimming world. The league is just for the elite swimmers. Somebody has to regulate and set up the rules in swimming. If you are a regulator, you should not be organizer of competition. In the future, FINA will have to make a choice."
Grigorishin said negotiations with global broadcasting outlets are ongoing.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."

European researchers to drill for ancient Antarctic ice
BERLIN (AP) — A group of 14 European scientific institutions plan to retrieve the world\'s oldest ice as part of research into past climate change.
The consortium led by the Germany-based Alfred Wegener Institute said Tuesday it has identified an area in Antarctica, nicknamed "Little Dome C," that should harbor ice as old as 1.5 million years.
So-called ice core measurements are crucial for scientists\' understanding of past climatic changes on Earth and the models they use to predict future global warming or cooling.
Current ice core measurements provide reliable data going back only about 800,000 years.
At a meeting in Vienna, the institutes said they spent the past three years working with American, Australian, Japanese and Russian colleagues using radar to determine the best possible site for drilling.


European court: Russia\'s house arrest of Navalny unlawful
MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
Navalny, a leading opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed Tuesday\'s ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled Tuesday that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.
___
1:50 p.m.
The European Central Bank has kept its policy promises, interest rates and stimulus settings unchanged as officials weigh looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a news conference Thursday, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more monetary stimulus in coming months. Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for an interest rate increase from the end of the year into next year.

DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) — China\'s prime minister has promised that Beijing will respect European standards and fair trade, seeking to allay concerns that it\'s flouting EU competition rules with huge investments on the continent.
Opening an annual summit of Eastern and Central European nations and China, Li Keqiang said "we intend to fully respect European standards."
Beijing has also been criticized for failing to give reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
He adds "we welcome openness and we want to treat all companies that operate in China equally and to increase imports from the (European) countries."
EU member Croatia is hosting a two-day summit between China and 16 regional countries on expanding business between China and the region, dubbed 16+1.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has left its policy promises and interest rates unchanged as it weighs looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
The ECB has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve in pausing the withdrawal of stimulus measures deployed over a decade to bounce back from the global financial crisis, as central bankers around the world ponder which way the economy is headed. The Fed has already started raising rates but has backed off plans for further rate increases in 2019.
The ECB\'s 25-member governing council was content to stand pat on Thursday, making no changes to its short policy statement. The bank took several steps to support the economy on March 7. Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.
The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4 percent, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year — if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3 percent for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8 percent from a peak of 12.1 percent in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3 percent from 3.5 percent.
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.

Oil products output at Europe’s largest oil refinery—Shell’s 404,000-bpd Pernis refinery in the Netherlands—will be reduced after workers started a strike on Monday, demanding higher wages.
“There will be impact on production but at this point we can’t say exactly what the exact impact will be because we don’t know yet,” a spokeswoman for Shell told Reuters today, confirming that the industrial action, which local trade unions threatened in March, had begun.
In March, Dutch trade union CNV gave Shell seven days to meet their demands before announcing a strike.
At the end of last month, CNV said that workers would reduce production at the Pernis refinery and the Moerdijk chemical plant beginning on April 8 and would keep output at lower levels until workers’ demand are met.
The union had given no indications of the amount of output reduction, but Pernis is the largest oil refinery in Europe, and the point is to reduce output to a level that would force Shell to meet demands for higher wages.
Unions want a 5-percent wages increase, while Shell offers a 2-percent raise this year and another 2.5-percent salary increase next year, according to Reuters.
“We are taking it day by day, we will have another technical meeting with the unions this afternoon, and we will take it from there,” Shell’s spokeswoman told Reuters today.
According to the FNV trade union, production at the Pernis refinery will be gradually cut to 65 percent of the facility’s capacity today, as part of the strike for higher wages.
The reduction will be kept in place until Wednesday night, after which the trade union will discuss where negotiations are going and what to do next, FNV trade union’s spokesman Egbert Schellenberg told Reuters on Monday.
Shell has just launched a new unit at Pernis in October last year to enhance performance and reduce environmental impact by enabling the processing of more oil into cleaner transportation fuels.

Tesla’s Model 3 has started to reach eastern European countries like Poland, where electric vehicle (EV) are not as popular as they are in Western European countries like Norway for example, in part due to their prices.
Since Tesla started overseas shipments of its most affordable sedan Model 3 earlier this year, at least 10 such models have been delivered to Poland over the past three weeks, Tomek Ga?, one of the first owners of an EV in Poland and an EV consultant for companies, reports for CleanTechnica.
Tesla began shipments of Model 3 to Europe in early February this year, with countries in Western Europe the first markets to receive Model 3s.
While it will take time for deliveries in Eastern Europe to take off, Norway—Europe’s EV leader—saw Model 3 registrations at a total of 6,129 vehicles as of April 1, according to teslastats.no.
Last year, nearly one in three new car sales in Norway were pure EVs, with the EVs share at 31.2 percent, while the EVs and plug-ins total share stood at 49.1 percent, in a nation with a population of just over 5 million people.
Tesla Model 3 topped the global EV sales ranking compiled by CleanTechnica and EV Volumes for 2018. In fact, Tesla as a brand dominated the top 5, with all three of its models there. The Nissan Leaf and BAIC EC-Series were also among the top five EVs sold in 2018.
In absolute terms, Tesla Model 3 sales topped 140,000, with Chinese BAIC’s EC-Series at about 90,000 vehicles and the Nissan Leaf slightly lower than that. Tesla challengers from BMW, Toyota, Renault, and Mitsubishi were far down the list.
The ranking suggests that the Model 3 may indeed turn out to be the car that will tip Tesla’s fortunes into positive territory, after a string of mass production delays and an even longer string of quarterly losses reported by Tesla.

Yesterday’s headlines suggested that European markets were taking a beating from rising oil prices--but this was a blip on the radar tracking some of the toughest resilience to a combination of global market and geopolitical forces that have given oil its best quarter in a decade.
No, European markets aren’t being “stung”--despite everything.
Instead, the triple whammy of a U.S. tariff threat, rising oil prices and waning optimism over a Brexit deadlock and have failed to put a damper on battle weary European markets. European stocks were only mildly lower on Tuesday morning as market participants turned their attention to the renewed tariff threat from Washington.
The pan-European Euro Stoxx 600 Index (SXXP) was down a mere 0.1 percent at open of business 0800 Hrs UTC, with most sectors and bourses slightly in the red. All leading markets were, however, able to reverse course, with SXXP flashing a 0.4 percent gain by 1000 Hrs UTC. This comes after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Monday proposed tariffs on a raft of European products as retaliation for European aircraft subsidies.
Meanwhile, crude oil is off to another bright start after a strong ending to the week Friday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was at $64.74, up 0.53 percent from Friday’s close, while Brent Crude gained 0.25 percent to close the day at $71.28 per barrel. Both benchmarks have now climbed nearly 50 percent from their December lows. Related: China-South Sudan Oil Deal Raises Red Flags

New tariffs
The United States is considering slapping tariffs on about $11 billion of EU products ranging from aircraft to wine and cheese. The USTR said the new tariffs are retaliation against more than $11 billion worth of damage from EU subsidies to Airbus that the World Trade Organization (WTO) has found causes adverse effects to the U.S.
Both the US and EU have been battling for 14 years over claims and counterclaims of illegal aid to their respective aircraft makers, Boeing and Airbus. Both sides have accused the other of paying out billions of dollars in subsidies so as to gain an advantage in the global airspace business. A recalcitrant EU has refused to stop with the subsidies, and has even doled out additional aid since the challenge as per the USTR.
Lighthizer has made it clear that the EU must agree to end all WTO-inconsistent subsidies to large civil aircraft if it wants the U.S. to lift related duties and tariffs. The USTR says it will announce a final product list once a WTO arbiter evaluates the claims. Related: Self-Sufficient Floating Islands May Soon Become Reality
The general trajectory of the latest US trade impasse does not bode well for the markets. While $11 billion in tariffs is unlikely to cause much damage to the $19-trillion regional economy, readers should not forget that the unresolved trade war with China kicked off in earnest after the US imposed tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese imports before later escalating it to $200 billion.
It’s probably going to take only a single round of retaliatory tariffs from either side for the transatlantic trade tensions to hit fever pitch.
London Stock Market Listings Plunge Nearly 70%
Trade spats aside, the EU has more than enough on its plate to worry about as is. That the region’s stock markets have continued to perform admirably amidst all the Brexit snafu (SXXP is up 14.8 percent YTD) belies the fact that the political divorce could be causing plenty of damage elsewhere.
Specifically, reports have emerged that Europe’s startups are no longer interested in listing. New listings on the London Stock Exchange plunged nearly 70 percent during the first quarter to £481m following the IPO of just five companies. That’s the worst showing since 2011, and compares poorly with 16 admissions worth £1.3 billion for last year’s corresponding period.
Clearly, few companies are willing to take the plunge during Britain’s watershed moment.
No worries over oil rally
As for oil prices, investors should probably not lose sleep over it.
Crude has enjoyed a massive rally since late December, including many weeks of uninterrupted gains. The current run is being driven by OPEC production cuts, slowing growth in the U.S. shale patch, a rebel takeover of key oilfields in Libya, the political crisis in Algeria, Iran sanctions, and production and export declines in Venezuela.
However, the jury is out as to whether the market can sustain the rally for much longer.
In February, Goldman Sachs warned that Brent could hit $70-$75 per barrel before pulling back due to a surge in US shale output.
If the market defies the bearish call, then investors can still take comfort in the fact that past studies have found little correlation between oil price movements and the stock market.

Social media is a breeding ground for conspiracy theories and it seems the Duchess of Sussex\xe2\x80\x99s pregnancy has become the latest target.
According to The Sun, outrageous trolls are falsely claiming that Meghan is not actually expecting and that her baby bump is actually a “moonbump” prosthetic.
The Times reported that a YouTube video which claims to provide “absolute proof” Meghan’s pregnancy is fake has had over 208k views.
The channel that hosts it has 31,000 subscribers and the person behind it has launched a number of videos repeating the same false allegation, with each one getting 50,000 hits.
The first was released on the day that 37-year-old Meghan’s pregnancy was announced by Kensington Palace.
The crazy conspiracy theory, circulated by people who dislike the Duchess, suggest the royal couple have a secret surrogate who is really carrying the baby.

Beyonce was also subjected to such claims when she was pregnant with twins.
The false claims, which have also been doing the round on Twitter, Instagram and on Prince Harry fan pages on Facebook, link the “fake” pregnancy to a wider conspiracy involving global elites.
The trolls point to a photo recently circulated online in which the baby bump looks “square”.
But an obstetric nurse also waded in to say that she had seen all shapes and sizes of baby bumps and Meghan’s was not unusual.
The former actress has been subjected to torrents of racist and sexist abuse on social media in the past.
Last month, in a speech and King’s College London, she said she now avoided social media.
And after the couple launched their Instagram page this week, racist comments were posted on the profile.
Meghan’s due date has not been announced but is thought to be later this month or the beginning of May.
The Duke and Duchess have now moved into Frogmore Cottage in Windsor after a £3m refurbishment.

Nearly every day for years, Margot Wolk was presented with beautifully prepared meals.
It was during the final years of World War II in Poland and very few people had the luxury of eating at all, let alone having fresh meals brought right to them.
But Ms Wolk dreaded every meal she had to eat.
She was so terrified that she would have to hold back tears through each mouthful wondering if it would be her last.
This was the daily reality for her and the 14 other women tasked with tasting the meals prepared for Adolf Hitler to ensure they weren’t poisoned.
Ms Wolk kept her time working as Hitler’s taste tester a secret for 70 years until she reached the age of 95 and decided to share her story.
It was 1941 and she was just 24 when bombs destroyed her parents apartment in Berlin, forcing her to move to her mother-in-law’s home in Gross-Partsch, now known as Parcz, Poland.
The house was less than three kilometres away from Hitler’s first Eastern Front military headquarters, which was ominously dubbed Woldsschanze, or Wolf’s Lair.
Shortly after her arrival, Ms Wolk was told by the mayor she had been chosen as one of the 15 women recruited by the SS to become a taste tester.
All her life the young woman had resisted against the Nazis. When she was younger she had refused to join the League of German Girls, the female version of the Hitler Youth.
Her father had also been punished when he refused to join the Nazi Party.
Now she had found herself forced into protecting the man she despised and feared.
“The food was always vegetarian,” she told Berlin’s RBB television channel during an interview in 2014.
“There were constant rumours that the British were out to poison Hitler. He never ate meat. We were given rice, noodles, peppers, peas and cauliflower.”
The women were picked up by bus every day and taken to the barracks where they would be made to eat the food being served to Hitler that day.
“Some of the girls started to shed tears as they began eating because they were so afraid. We had to eat it all up,” Ms Wolk said.
“Then we had to wait an hour, and every time we were frightened that we were going to be ill.”
The women used to “cry like dogs” after every meal because they were so happy to have survived another day.
Once the food was declared safe it was put in crates and delivered to the Nazi leader.
After coming across an article about Ms Wolk in a newspaper, Italian author Rosella Postorino was transfixed by the story of Hitler’s female taste testers.
She knew that this was a story that needed to be told, leading to her writing At The Wolf’s Table.
It follows the life of Rosa, a character based off Ms Wolk and her experiences in the second world war.
The novel has been a bestseller in Europe and has since been translated into English and is available through publisher Simon and Schuster.
“It is about a time in the war that hasn’t really been written about a lot,” a Simon and Schuster spokesperson told news.com.au
“She is an extraordinary character. She writes the character so beautifully and it really helps readers understand what it must have been like.
“It’s hard to even imagine what it would be like to play Russian roulette every day with your life.”
Though Ms Wolk ate his meals on a nearly daily basis, she never saw Hitler in person due to the tight security.
Security was ramped up even more after a plot to assassinate Hitler in the Wolf’s Lair failed in 1944.
After that bombing the food tasters were no longer allowed to stay at home and were moved into a vacant building nearby.
“We were guarded like caged animals,” Ms Wolk told German news site Spiegel Online in 2013.
Despite the strict security, one of the SS guards used a ladder to sneak into her bedroom one night and rape her.
She told German media that she had never felt so helpless in her life.
By this point in 1944, the Soviet army had nearly reached the Wolf’s Lair and with the help of one of the Nazi lieutenants she managed to escape on a train to Berlin.
Ms Wolk later found out that she was the only food tester that made it out alive. All the other women were shot by Soviet soldiers.
After reaching Berlin and finally being free of the Wolf’s Lair, Ms Wolk was faced with another horrific situation.
Upon her return she was captured by the Soviet army who held her captive for two weeks where she was repeatedly raped and beaten.
“It was hell on earth. The nightmare never goes away,” she said.
Ms Wolk was left with such brutal injuries that she was never able to have children.
It wasn’t until 1946 when her husband turned up on her doorstep that she started to regain hope after the nightmares she was forced to endure.
She had assumed he died in the war but they were reunited when he was finally allowed home from a Soviet prisoner of war camp.
Ms Wolk died in 2014, after finally sharing her story with the world.
“I just wanted to say what happened there,” she said.
“That Hitler was a really repugnant man. And a pig.”
At The Wolf’s Table is out now through publisher Simon and Schuster.


It was a crime that shocked the world \xe2\x80\x94 the abduction rape and murder of six-year-old Alesha MacPhail on a tiny Scottish island.
But now the teenage boy jailed last month for the senseless slaying has lodged an appeal against the severity of his sentence.
Aaron Campbell, 16, was ordered to serve a minimum of 27 years of a life term imposed for Alesha’s murder on the Isle of Bute on July 2 last year.
During his trial, Campbell denied ever having met Alesha but confessed just before he was sentenced.
Judge Lord Matthews described him as a “cold, callous, calculating, remorseless and dangerous individual”.
The Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service confirmed Campbell had lodged a notice of appeal against his sentence, according to the BBC.
Alesha, who lived with her mother in North Lanarkshire, near Glasgow, Scotland, was staying with her father and his girlfriend on the island for the summer when Campbell snatched her from her bed in the middle of the night.
Her body was found in the grounds of a former hotel the following morning. A post-mortem examination later revealed she had suffered 117 separate injuries.
During his nine-day trial in February, Campbell lodged a special defence naming the 18-year-old girlfriend of Alesha’s father Robert MacPhail as the killer.
The teenager even took the stand and told the jury he’d had a sexual affair with Toni McLachlan and that she had planted DNA evidence from a used condom.
The jury, however found the forensic evidence and incriminating CCTV footage supplied by Campbell’s mother more compelling than his testimony and took just three hours to return a unanimous guilty verdict.
When he returned to the dock to be sentenced last month, the court heard the teen had finally confessed to the crime.
During the trial, the court heard Campbell told a psychologist that when he walked into the Alesha’s bedroom and found her sleeping, all he could think about was “killing her”.
He carried the little girl from the house and into the woods before removing her clothes and raping her. He then smothered her to death and dumped her body nearby.
Alesha’s mum Georgina Lochrane sobbed as details of his confession, in which he said Alesha had woken up in his arms as he carried her away at 2am, were read out in court, The Sun reported.
He told the child he was a friend of her father and was taking her home.
“You told him (the psychologist) that in the 12 months prior to the murder, you thought of doing something excessive, including rape,” Judge Matthews said.
“He records that when you saw Alesha, your reaction was according to you ‘a moment of opportunity’ … ‘all I thought about was killing her once I saw her’.
Defending Queen’s Counsel, Brian McConnachie said the teen had shown “traits on the psychopathy checklist” during the psychological profile.
There were screams of “f***ing paedo” as he was led to the cells after being sentenced to a minimum of 27 years behind bars, British media reported.
Judge Matthews told Campbell the case was “one of the wickedest and most evil crimes in the history of this court”.


Russia sent its secret new Su-57 stealth fighter prototypes to Syria to see how they performed. Now, the whole project has just been dumped
China says it will buy Russia\xe2\x80\x99s advanced Su-57 stealth fighter in a move that will further cement the nation\xe2\x80\x99s status as a rising world superpower.
The Beijing controlled Global Times reports Moscow has released the advanced new fighter jet for expert in a bid to attract scarce foreign currency.
President Vladimir Putin has been subject to increasingly stringent international sanctions following the invasion of Crimea and parts of Georgia, as well as his support for the ongoing insurgency in Ukraine.
But China is not among the signatories to the punitive measures.
RELATED: What we know about Russia’s Su-57
MORE: What we know about China’s J-20
The Global Times says the offer of the Su-57 was “an indication of the close strategic relations between the two countries.”
But the advanced jet, touted by President Putin as “the world’s best military plane”, is not without its problems.
Russia has itself slashed orders for the fifth-generation aircraft, that is said to be able to use its stealth characteristics to enable penetrating ground strikes against ground and naval targets. It’s also supposed to be outfitted with a suite of sensors capable of taking on the United States’ F-22 Raptor fighter and B-1 Spirit bomber.
EXPORT APPROVAL
The Global Times reports Viktor Kladov, director Russia’s Rostec defence firm, as saying the Su-57E export version of the jet will likely be approved for international sale in a few weeks. “China has recently taken delivery of 24 Su-35 aircraft, and in the next two years [China] will make a decision to either procure additional Su-35s, build the Su-35 in China, or buy a fifth-generation fighter aircraft, which could be another opportunity for the Su-57E,” he told a gathering at an exhibition in Malaysia.

He added that India was also still a potential market, despite recent moves to acquire the Rafale fighter from France.
China, however, may see the Su-57E as a competitor on the export market to its own FC-31 stealth jet. This aircraft, while not operational within China’s military, is being considered for adaptation to future aircraft carrier use.
The FC-31 and F-35 Strike Fighter are the only two stealth aircraft currently available through international export.
REVERSE ENGINEERING
China has in the past bought advanced Russian combat aircraft and technology, only to pull them to pieces to understand how they work. This ‘reverse engineering’ was then applied to the design and development of their own equipment.
The Global Times indicates this may also be the case with the Su-57.
“Xu Guangyu, a senior consultant at the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, told the Global Times that it is possible that China could make the purchase, because China needs to study from other countries’ strengths whenever possible.”
China is perfecting its own fifth-generation J-20 fighter, which is already operational in several squadrons and is approaching the point of mass production.
RELATED: Here’s the US Air Force vision of future war
Some of the Su-57’s features may be useful.
Wang Yongqing, chief designer of the Shenyang Aircraft Design Institute, states that the Su-57 is designed to “have strong supersonic cruise capability and super-maneuverability, and intentionally reduces stealth, a capability said to be crucial to a fifth-generation fighter, to a secondary priority”.
India had been a partner in developing the jet, but there doubts have arisen whether or not it will purchase the fighter over concerns about its performance and suitability. .


The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have set up their own official Instagram account.
Prince Harry and wife Meghan, who are expecting a baby this month, said @SussexRoyal would be used to share the work that drives them, and important announcements.
The move comes as the duke and duchess are splitting their household from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, whose Instagram account is @KensingtonRoyal. Meghan and Harry’s new household will be based at Buckingham Palace, while William — the future King — and Kate will remain at Kensington Palace.
In a message on their first post, Harry and Meghan thanked people for their support, saying: “Welcome to our official Instagram; we look forward to sharing the work that drives us, the causes we support, important announcements, and the opportunity to shine a light on key issues.

“We thank you for your support, and welcome you to @sussexroyal — Harry & Meghan.”
It was accompanied by an image bearing a white version of couple’s royal cipher — the entwined initials H and M below a coronet — on a navy background. Kensington Palace’s Twitter feed introduced the new account, saying: “Welcome to Instagram, SussexRoyal!”
The first post was a picture of their joint “HM” monogram, followed by a gallery of nine of their favourite images, including a previously unseen photo taken of the couple on Sydney Harbour during their royal tour last year.
The photo show Harry and Meghan on both solo and joint engagements and were taken around the world, with UK outings showcased alongside their recent visit to Morocco.
They were shared alongside a note from the couple welcoming fans to the page and ‘thanking them for the support’.
The account has racked up almost 400,000 followers, including celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow, David Beckham and Blake Lively.
It comes as Modern Family star Ed O’Neill revealed the Duchess of Sussex “grew up” on the set of the classic 90s sitcom Married … with Children.
Speaking to Ellen DeGeneres, the actor said: “By the way, she grew up on the set of Married … with Children. Did you know that? Her father was a camera operator.”
Meghan’s estranged father, Thomas, worked on the show for 10 of its 11 seasons, first as a lighting director and then as the director of photography.
“She used to come on the set in a little Catholic school uniform. She was like 9,” O’Neill recalled.
Meghan recalled hanging out on set during a 2018 interview with Esquire.
“My dad was a lighting director and director of photography for Married … with Children. He just retired actually last year.
“Every day after school for 10 years, I was on the set of Married … with Children, which is a really funny and perverse place for a little girl in a Catholic school uniform to grow up,” she told the magazine.
“There were a lot of times my dad would say, ‘Meg, why don’t you go and help with the craft services room over there? This is just a little off-colour for your 11-year-old eyes,’” she recalled.
Meghan also told the magazine she “wasn’t allowed to watch the show at home”, but, “I could watch the end credits so I could give the screen a kiss when I saw my dad’s name go by”.
Markle also recalled some of the actresses, some of whom had worked in the adult movie industry, turning up on set.
“You gotta think, there were guest stars like Tia Carrere and Traci Lords and Nikki Cox,” Meghan said.
“Those were the kind of women coming in every day. Just picture me with my curly hair and a gap in my teeth and my little school uniform with Keds on, looking up like, ‘Hi,’ at these very, uh, provocative women. It was a big change from Immaculate Heart Catholic School.”


The royal couple Meghan and Harry have joined Instagram with a joint account.
A drone pilot risked disaster by trying to take aerial photos of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\xe2\x80\x99s new home in the middle of the Heathrow flight path yesterday.
A photographer in Windsor Great Park spotted a quadcopter flying hundreds of metres in the air trying to sneak a peek of Frogmore Cottage in Berkshire, The Sun reported.
Between 5.02pm and 5.08pm, local time, the drone flew south to north along the line of The Long Walk — the route Harry and Meghan took on their wedding day — and hovered over Windsor Castle.
It then returned south down the The Long Walk, swerved east and headed directly to the royal couple’s new home Frogmore Cottage before returning south and vanishing.
The photographer, who snapped the drone on a long lens camera, estimated the height of the flying machine to be more than 300 metres.
The maximum height a drone can be legally flown, even in an uncontrolled airspace, is 121 metres.
The route taken by the drone was within a tightly controlled airspace called the London Central Zone — as well as being in the middle of the Heathrow arrivals and departures flight path.
ROGUE DRONE PILOT
A Heathrow Airport spokeswoman told The Sun Online the incident happened outside the 5km airport exclusion zone for flying drones.
“Heathrow operations weren’t impacted,” the spokeswoman added.
“Aircraft at that point are flying at approximately 2500 feet (762m).”
A Kensington Palace spokesperson declined to comment on the incident.
It is illegal to fly drones within the confines of Windsor Great Park and Windsor Castle.
Between noon and 7pm on Saturday, local time, this precise area was in the middle of the flight path for all arrivals into Heathrow Airport, with passenger jets flying through it at low altitude every two minutes.
A website dedicated to tracking all flights in and out of international airports showed that at 5.03pm on Saturday — right in the middle of the drone flight — eight passenger jets were lining up to make the final approach to Heathrow flying over this part of Windsor.
As passenger planes went over Frogmore Cottage every two minutes around 5pm on Saturday, they were at a height of between 396m and 427m, according to a flight tracking website.
A passer-by said of the drone flight: “We were walking along the Long Walk towards Windsor Castle a few hundred meters from the castle.
“The passenger jet flight path switches between times of day and at this time (5pm) arrivals were coming in right over our heads. They are always very low.
“The noise is deafening. There were jumbo jets (Boeing 747) and super jumbos (Airbus A380) and others.
“They come about every two minutes, and on Saturday, that was their flight path all afternoon. “Then in between the flights we heard the distinctive whirring of a drone overhead.”
The witness said they were “quite shocked” by the sight.
“It seems like such an obviously dangerous thing to do with the planes coming so low overheard and so regularly right in this area,” they said.
“It flew over our heads at about 200 metres up towards Windsor Castle and then went up very high almost out of sight, but we could see that it came back towards us then went to the east over to the area where I know Frogmore Cottage is.
“Then it returned to the Long Walk and flew back over our heads and went south out of sight.
“It was in the air above us for about five or six minutes. In that time, three flights must have come over in the exact same air space and also very low.”
Harry and Meghan only moved into Frogmore Cottage the day before, on Friday, April 5.
On Saturday, throughout the day, their new 10-bedroom home was directly under the flight path for Heathrow arrivals from around the world.
Between December 19 and 21, 2018, hundreds of flights were cancelled at Gatwick Airport, following reports of drone sightings close to the runway.
The reports caused major disruption, affecting approximately 140,000 passengers and 1000 flights.

In 1996, researcher J. Hooley\'s survey found \'a very disturbing picture of public and domestic violence against transgenders\', watch more to see more findings on this terrible issue that plagues the trans community.
A transgender woman has spoken out after being randomly attacked by a mob of protesters as she tried to enter a Paris Metro train station.
Julia spoke out after a video of her being brutally kicked and punched by the political protesters went viral, saying numerous attackers targeted her as she tried to make her way through the Place de la République in Paris. Alarming video shows the woman becoming surrounded by a jeering mob of protesters before she was attacked.
The protesters had gathered on Sunday to rally against Algeria’s ailing, 82-year-old president Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Since the rally, the President has resigned. Julia, 31, was in the area trying to enter a Paris Metro station and board a train.
As she made her way through the area she was harassed by protesters, who blocked her path and taunted her in Algerian. One man roughly ruffles her hair as others jump up and down chanting around her.
The video shows a girl draped in an Algerian flag coming to the aid of Julia, as the energy of the crowd around her appears to momentarily die down. Another man appears to try to be offering her support.
But as she tries to quickly exit the protester area, she is grabbed and pulled back by the shirt, by a man who punches her repeatedly. A melee breaks out before transport police rush to break up the violence.
French group Stop Homophobie have said the officers called Julia “monsieur” and told her “not to dress like that” after the brutal attack.
“I wanted to go down and take the metro. Three people were blocking my way, and one said: ‘Oh but actually you’re a man — we won’t let you through’,” she told France Inter radio.
She said during the incident one man flashed himself at her, and others threw beer over her.
“I’m not necessarily expecting these people to be punished but I want things to move forward and for the way people think to evolve,” she told BFMTV. Julia made it clear the attack was carried out by ignorant people, and was not a reflection of the Algerian community.
The case is being investigated by Parisian prosecutors, who are looking into it as a possible attack against a person due to their sexual orientation and gender identity.
The attack has been widely condemned by French political leaders, including Parisian Mayor Anne Hidalgo and Equality Minister Marlène Schiappa.


He\'s making headlines globally, but what exactly is going on with Julian Assange, Ecuador and the UK?
Julian Assange\xe2\x80\x99s stay at the Ecuadorean embassy will reportedly end within \xe2\x80\x9chours to days\xe2\x80\x9d, WikiLeaks has claimed.
WikiLeaks tweeted today that its founder would be turfed out of the embassy in London where he has lived for more than six years.
“A high level source within the Ecuadorian state has told @WikiLeaks that Julian Assange will be expelled within “hours to days” using the #INAPapers offshore scandal as a pretext — and that it already has an agreement with the UK for his arrest,” the tweet said.
The news comes after the INA Papers website published allegations of corruption involving Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno.
WikiLeaks has told AP: “If President Moreno wants to illegally terminate a refugee publisher’s asylum to cover up an offshore corruption scandal, history will not be kind”.
In an interview broadcast by several Ecuadorean radio stations on Tuesday, Mr Moreno said Mr Assange had “repeatedly violated” the conditions of his asylum at the country’s embassy in London.
Relations between Assange and his embassy hosts have been deteriorating for months.
In October, Assange sued Ecuador for violating his “fundamental rights” by limiting his access to the outside world after his internet and mobile phone access were blocked back in March.
Ecuador’s government has accused him of breaking “a written commitment” not to interfere in its foreign policies.
“It is not that he cannot speak freely, it is not that he cannot express himself freely, but he cannot lie, let alone hack into accounts or intercept private telephone calls” under the terms of his asylum agreement, Mr Moreno said.
Mr Moreno’s comments come after the Ecuadorean government filed a formal complaint to the UN special rapporteur on the right to privacy, Joseph Cannataci, accusing WikiLeaks of spreading private information linked to Mr Moreno.

Photos, videos and private conversations appeared on portals such as Twitter and Facebook.
Mr Moreno was also forced to deny allegations of corruption which surfaced on the website inapapers.org, with the president claiming he knew who was responsible for the accusations.
Assange sought refuge at the embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faced accusations of sexual assault that prosecutors in Stockholm have since abandoned.
He has refused to leave the embassy to avoid extradition to the United States to face charges over his website publishing huge caches of hacked State Department and Pentagon files in 2010.
The Australian denies the rape claims, and said he feared Sweden would pass him on to US authorities if he was extradited. The Swedish chief prosecutor dropped proceedings against him in 2017 because going ahead and serving notice of charges would necessitate Assange’s presence in court.
Mr Moreno reiterated Tuesday that the government continues “to seek a solution” to Assange’s situation.


Julian Assange has been arrested in London after being forcefully removed from the Ecuadorian embassy. The wikileaks founders now fears extradition to the United States to face charges of conspiracy.
After seven long years, Julian Assange was dragged from Ecuadorean embassy looking a very different man to the one that went in.
The battle between the WikiLeaks founder and the American government was always going to be epic, involving concepts like free speech, journalists’ rights, national interests, even treason.
As Assange settles in to his first night in British custody, his allies and enemies are gearing up for what promises to be a long, dogged legal slog, not only over his possible extradition to the US but over how US courts should view his actions, which sharply cleave public opinion.
Whatever happens now, one thing is clear: Assange, who was dragged out of the embassy and arrested on Thursday by British police after Ecuador withdrew his political asylum, is not going anywhere soon. Extradition to the US could take years more.
But it was the appearance of the bearded Assange being dragged from the embassy that shocked people the most.
Assange has been seen on the balcony of the London embassy in the past, but the new-look Assange showed his dramatic transformation.
Assange’s saga kicked off in November 2010, when his publication of 250,000 confidential US diplomatic cables that month left American officialdom apoplectic.
Joe Biden, then-US vice president, compared Assange to a “high-tech terrorist.” Sarah Palin, the former Republican vice presidential candidate, called for him to be hunted down by US troops like an al-Qaeda operative.
Tempers at the top eventually cooled - Palin would later apologise to Assange after he began publishing material about US Democrats. As a candidate, President Donald Trump startled many Americans by repeatedly praising WikiLeaks. But in the US intelligence community, the rage against Assange lingered. On the sidelines of a conference a few years ago, a former senior National Security Agency official told an Associated Press journalist that all he wanted was a couple of minutes alone with Assange in a dark alley, grasping his hands together as if he were crushing a man’s windpipe.
Assange once travelled easily to the US, appearing at the National Press Club in Washington on April 2010 to present “Collateral Murder,” the title he chose for the camera footage that captured American helicopter pilots laughing as they fired at a crowd of civilians they mistook for Iraqi insurgents. Shortly after his visit, his source for the video - an American Army intelligence analyst now named Chelsea Manning - would be arrested after an ill- advised online confession.
Assange dropped out of sight, likely aware that the government now had spools of conversations between him and Manning, including the one that now forms the centrepiece of the Justice Department’s newly unveiled indictment against Assange for conspiracy to hack into a US government computer. Staying in Britain, a close ally of the United States, was risky. In a fateful move, Assange decided to scope out Sweden, a country with powerful press protections and where he had already located some of WikiLeaks’ servers. The expedition would prove to be a disaster.
Two women he stayed with there would soon go to the police with allegations of sexual assault and rape. The prosecution nearly tore WikiLeaks apart and threatened the upcoming publication the US diplomatic cables. With Sweden out of the question and “Cablegate” sure to enrage the Americans further, Assange looked to Moscow. He considered the idea of getting a Russian visa.
Assange would eventually get the visa but it came several weeks too late. Sweden had already applied for an Interpol Red Notice, something akin to an international arrest warrant, making travel all but impossible. That left Assange little choice but to turn himself in on December 7, 2010, to British authorities.
Assange was granted bail in England while his London legal battle against extradition went all the way to Britain’s Supreme Court.
When that court finally turned him down, Assange dyed his hair, popped in coloured contacts and skipped bail, fleeing to the Ecuadorean Embassy. From there, he carried on as before, albeit in a more constricted space in a back room in the embassy.
The embassy stalemate dragged on for years, costing the British government millions in policing costs.
But it didn’t stop Assange from publishing new material, notably in 2016, when his disclosure of US Democratic Party documents stolen by Russian hackers hurt Hillary Clinton’s presidential election campaign.
But if Assange had hoped for leniency from America’s new president, he would soon be disappointed. Twitter messages between WikiLeaks and Trump’s eldest son, Donald Jr., showed the group lobbying him to get his father to suggest that Australia appoint its native son Assange to be its ambassador to the US. Instead, the Trump administration promoted him to public enemy; in a 2017 speech, then-CIA director Mike Pompeo described WikiLeaks as a “hostile non- state intelligence agency.”
Meanwhile, Assange wasn’t getting much more satisfaction from his Latin American host, which was increasingly embarrassed by its house guest’s publications. The government of Ecuador tried all kinds of creative solutions to break the embassy impasse, including an abortive attempt to send Assange to Russia under diplomatic cover. When it became clear that the WikiLeaks founder wasn’t leaving - and that he wouldn’t curb his publications to suit Ecuador’s diplomatic interests - the government looked for a way to wash its hands of him. WikiLeaks had issued one of its periodic warnings that Assange was at risk but the Thursday raid was still a surprise.
Britain has generally tended to favour accused hackers fighting extradition to America.
Lauri Love, a friend of Assange’s who was accused of penetrating US government networks, was last year spared extradition after Britain’s high court ruled in his favour.
British hacker Gary McKinnon, accused of breaking into US military and space networks, won his fight against extradition in 2012 after a decade-long struggle.
Assange’s fight may not take a decade, but he’s unlikely to see the inside of a US courtroom anytime soon.


Julian Assange has been arrested in London after being forcefully removed from the Ecuadorian embassy. The wikileaks founders now fears extradition to the United States to face charges of conspiracy.
As tensions with Julian Assange mounted in recent weeks, the WikiLeaks founder acted out with hostility against his hosts at the country\xe2\x80\x99s embassy in London, according to Ecuador\xe2\x80\x99s government.
And Assange’s friendship with former Playboy model Pamela Anderson, which she’s referred to as a “romantic struggle”, may have caused upset to the largely Catholic South American nation.
Ecuador Foreign Minister Jose Valencia spoke to politicians on Thursday, describing what he said were Assange’s repeated violations of the conditions of his asylum that led the government to expel him from the diplomatic mission after almost seven years, handing him over to British authorities.
Mr Valencia said what began as erratic behaviour by Assange — roller skating and playing soccer in embassy hallways and listening to loud music at all hours — evolved in recent months into aggressive behaviour toward embassy staff.
Mr Valencia alleges that Assange on occasions hit staff, charged with guaranteeing his wellbeing, and accused embassy officials of being US spies looking to exchange information on WikiLeaks in exchange for debt relief for Ecuador.
Ecuador’s president Lenin Moreno repeated allegations that Assange smeared waste on the walls of the embassy building and said that was a sign of how the WikiLeaks founder viewed Ecuador as an insignificant, third-rate country.
“When you’re given shelter, cared for and provided food you don’t denounce the owner of the house,” said Mr Moreno to applause at an event outside Quito.
Interior Minister Maria Paula Romo claimed Assange got away with some unimaginable behaviour.
She said: “During his stay at the Ecuadorian Embassy, during the government of the former president Rafael Correa, they tolerated things like Mr Assange putting faeces on the walls of the embassy and other types of behaviour of this kind that is far removed from the minimum respect a guest should have in a country which has generously welcomed him.”
She did not make it clear if he had used his own poo or someone else’s.
Mr Moreno added that Ecuador will “be more careful in giving asylum to people who are really worth it and not miserable hackers whose only goal is to destabilise governments”.
“We are tolerant, calm people but we’re not stupid,” he said.
The French lawyer for Julian Assange says he wants President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring him from a London jail to France, where his small child lives.
Juan Branco suggested in an interview hours after the arrest on Thursday of the Wikileaks founder that he could risk life in prison on trumped-up charges if extradited to the US.
Assange faces US charges related to the publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents, with an extradition hearing on May 2.
For Mr Branco, Assange is a journalist who “revealed information to the general public about crimes against humanity, war crimes”.
He said arresting Assange is “some kind of revenge.” Mr Branco spoke to Assange last week and said he last saw him at Christmas at the Ecuadorian Embassy.
PAMELA ANDERSON: HE IS A HERO
Pamela Anderson, a friend and supporter of the Wikileaks founder, launched a spectacular rant against Ecuador, the USA and the UK. She praised Assange, calling him “defiant and courageous”, and described his arrest as a diversionary and “idiotic” tactic to distract from Brexit and backwards governance in the USA.

Ms Anderson, who has spent time with Assange over the past three years urged the US to pardon him in numerous interviews, saying, “He is a hero,” in 2016.
While visiting Assange in the embassy, Ms Anderson denied claims the pair were in a romantic relationship. However, Ecuador is an observant Catholic country, and the seamy optics of Assange and Ms Anderson being locked inside embassy rooms together carrying out an illicit affair, was not an ideal thing for the publisher to foster.
Ms Anderson did go so far as to confirm Assange is her “favourite person” and has called the relationship a “romantic struggle”.
“He is a hero,” she said, early in their relationship. “One day everyone will realise …. Everyone in the world has benefited because of WikiLeaks — he has sacrificed so much — to simply share the truth.”
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that Assange can expect to face the process of the other country’s law, while explaining that Australia will provide the Aussie Wikileaks founder with usual consular assistance he can expect “no special treatment”.
“He will have to face the justice system when Australians go overseas, and if they violate other countries’ laws then obviously they have to face the process before those
alleged actions, that is where he will be,” Mr Morrison told Sunrise this morning.
“He will get the consular assistance as you would expect him to but he will have to make his way through whatever has come his way in terms of the justice system there.
“He won’t be getting special treatment from Australia. He will be getting the same treatment that any other Australian would get in circumstances.”
ASSANGE FACES COURT IN LONDON
Judge Michael Snow quickly found Assange guilty of breaching bail on Thursday after he appeared in the courtroom where his supporters packed the public gallery.
Assange faces a sentence of up to 12 months for the conviction, and has serious charges pending in the United States.
The basis of Assange’s defence was that he couldn’t expect a fair trial in British courts as the UK’s purpose was to “secure his delivery” to the United States.
Assange also faced sexual assault allegations in Sweden when he sought asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London 2012. The sexual assault charges have since been dropped, but a charge of skipping bail remained in place.
The US Justice Department has charged Assange with conspiring with Chelsea Manning to break into a classified government computer.
His lawyer has previously said that Assange planned to fight any US charges against him.
The indictment accuses Assange of assisting Manning, a former US intelligence analyst, in cracking a password that helped Manning infiltrate Pentagon computers.
‘WORRYING FOR ANY AUSTRALIAN’: ASSANGE’S AUSSIE LAWYER
\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say it came as a great surprise.\xe2\x80\x9d A member of Julian Assange\xe2\x80\x99s legal team on his arrest. #9Today pic.twitter.com/x5VUQJ3BIA \xe2\x80\x94 The Today Show (@TheTodayShow) April 11, 2019
Assange’s Australian lawyer, Greg Barnes, this morning accused the British government of denying Assange of access to proper medical treatment over the last six months and said his health has “deteriorated remarkably”.
“Certainly I think the stress created by the really difficult conditions the Ecuadorians gave him, in the last 12 months, but the last six months in particular has meant it has been a very, very tough ride for him. Particularly as I say in the last month,” Mr Barnes said.
Barnes said Assange will first face sentencing for breaching his bail conditions in 2012.
“Then there is the issue of the extradition, which is pretty worrying for any Australian,” he said of the Assange’s fears of being prosecuted in the U.S.
Mr Barnes praised Assange’s work, saying the Wikileaks founder was awarded a Walkley after publishing material in 2010 exposing atrocities in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
“Now he finds he will be prosecuted for it and potentially go to jail for a long time,” Mr Barnes said.
“That’s why the Australian government needs to take a strong and active interest in this case.”
FORMER ECUADORIAN PRESIDENT CRITICISES LEADER
Former Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa is accusing the nation’s current leader of retaliating against Assange for WikiLeaks’ publication of documents that allegedly implicate Mr Moreno in corruption.
Mr Correa — who led the South American nation when Assange was granted asylum in Ecuador’s London embassy — said Thursday that the decision to revoke asylum is “cowardly”.
In a stream of remarks on Twitter, Mr Correa criticised Mr Moreno for allowing British authorities to arrest Assange, and linked that to WikiLeaks’ disclosure about an offshore bank account allegedly linked to Moreno’s family and friends.
Mr Correa said the decision “will never been forgotten by all of humanity.”
SWEDISH WOMAN DOING ‘EVERYTHING’ TO HAVE RAPE CASE REOPENED
The Swedish woman who alleged that she was raped by Assange during a visit to Stockholm in 2010 has welcomed his arrest in London.
Elisabeth Massi Fritz, the lawyer for the unnamed woman, says news of Assange’s arrest earlier Thursday came as “a shock to my client” and that it was something “we have been waiting and hoping for since 2012.”
Ms Massi Fritz said in a text message sent to the Associated Press that “we are going to do everything” to have the Swedish case reopened “so Assange can be extradited to Sweden and prosecuted for rape.”
Ms Massi Fritz said “no rape victim should have to wait nine years to see justice be served.” In 2017, Sweden’s top prosecutor dropped a long-running inquiry into a rape claim against Assange, saying there was no way to have Assange detained or charged within a foreseeable future because of his protected status inside the embassy.


Police in Greece have charged a 31-year-old Bulgarian man with the murder of Greek-Australian gangster John Macris.
The man was arrested on Tuesday in a hotel in Glyfada, a neighbourhood in Athens, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.
He gave a statement to police on Wednesday and was charged with the murder of Macris on Thursday.
Police are searching for the man’s 35-year-old brother who is also believed to be a suspect.
Last November, shocking footage of what appeared to be Macris’ assassination was published.
Athens newspaper Kathimerini published CCTV footage showing the last moments of the notorious Sydney gangster who was gunned down on October 31.
In the video, a man dressed in grey and black runs towards a black car while firing shots into the vehicle.
The publication chose only to publish parts of the footage but explained Macris had just got into his car when the shooter approached.
After being hit, Macris emerged from the car and tried to escape, but the assassin followed him and kept shooting.
Police said he was shot four times with a 9mm handgun and died at the scene. He was leaving his home in Voula when he was shot.
Sydney criminal lawyer Brett Galloway described Macris as a small-time drug dealer with aspirations to become a big-time gangster.
Mr Galloway said he represented Macris in court about a dozen times, mostly on charges relating to modest quantities of illicit drugs.
“He was a nondescript sort of dude who wanted to be a gangster,” Mr Galloway said. “He wasn’t a big criminal. He wasn’t well known like some of the hoods around town,” he added.
Macris’ life of crime did not appear to be a financial success, the lawyer said.
“I wouldn’t call Johnnie a generous man with his money,” Mr Galloway said. “If you want to be a gangster, someone takes your spot eventually. That’s how it goes.”


British politicians have rejected Theresa May\'s divorce deal with the European Union for a third time leaving Brexit in uncertainty.
Furious Tory Brexiteers have launched a fresh push to unseat Theresa May within days.
Eurosceptic rebels want to see the PM pushed out on Wednesday — in time for Britain to quit the EU with No Deal on Friday.
The latest revolt was kicked off today by Mark Francois, vice-chairman of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group, The Sun reported.
As the PM fought to save her leadership:
— Cross-party talks designed to find a Brexit compromise restarted after three days
— Mrs May prepared to jet to Europe for talks with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron
— Boris Johnson warned the PM not to keep Britain in the customs union
Mr Francois wrote to Tory backbench chief Sir Graham Brady demanding a non-binding vote on Mrs May’s leadership at the next gathering of MPs.
The Rayleigh & Wickford MP suggested that if backbenchers voted to oust the PM, she would be under intense moral pressure to resign.
He added that in those circumstances, EU bosses would refuse to grant a further delay to Brexit — meaning the UK would leave on April 12 without a deal.
Emmanuel Macron has already threatened to veto any extension to Article 50 unless there’s a clear process in place to find a new way forward on Brexit.
BREXIT BOMBSHELL
In his letter to Sir Graham, chair of the powerful 1922 Committee, Mr Francois blasted: “We are living in a world gone mad.
“Having been totally let down by our own ‘Officer Class’ in the Cabinet, who continue to cower back at the Chateau, it now clearly falls to the ‘poor bloody infantry’ of the Conservative backbenches to prevent us being forced into a customs union with Labour support.
“If, therefore, my colleagues were to demonstrate prior to Wednesday evening, in an indicative ballot say at 3pm, prior to the meeting of the 1922 Committee, that they have lost confidence in the Prime Minister I believe that under those circumstances it is extremely unlikely that the European Council would grant an extension and we would, therefore, leave the European Union on Friday night, as so many Tory MPs so obviously want.”
It’s now up to Sir Graham to decide whether or not to hold a no-confidence vote in Mrs May this week.
The motion would not be binding because the PM can’t be formally challenged until December after seeing off an attempt to oust her last year.
May loyalists have accused Sir Graham of overstepping his authority by accepting letters from backbenchers.
The 1922 Committee boss tonight suggested he would reject Mr Francois’ request for a fresh confidence vote.
He told ITV News: “The executive have discussed this and there’s no intention of proceeding.”

Instagrammers are spoiling once great and unique locations just to grab the perfect pic. Overcrowding, bad behaviour and local unrest has seen popular tourist cities fight back.
Benidorm is a popular holiday location for tourists seeking good weather and cheap booze \xe2\x80\x94 especially among the Brits.
And since cheap holiday deals attracted massive crowds of rowdy tourists, locals have been complaining about the bad behaviour becoming a stain on their town.
But Benidorm, a slice of paradise on Spain’s eastern coast, wasn’t always a magnet for partying, sex and wild antics — once upon a time, it was a small and humble fishing port, The Sun reports.
The city was once a charming fishing village with nothing much going on but tuna fishing, until the early 20th century.
In 1914, a new railway brought Spanish day-trippers to the town, who fell in love with its long sandy beaches.
Benidorm was put on the map in 1925 as a tourist destination when its port was extended and the first hotels were built there — although it was still only the Spanish heading there on holiday.
And then the “bikini revolution” happened.
In 1950, Pedro Zaragoza became mayor of Benidorm and he vowed to put the town of just 1700 residents on the map.
But there was one problem — you couldn’t wear bikinis on the beach due to the strict fascist dictatorship under General Franco, which was supported by the Roman Catholic church.
Mr Zaragoza spoke to General Franco himself personally and managed to get permission for women to wear bikinis, creating a revolution in Spanish tourism.
Gildo Seisdedos, urban planning professor at the IE Business School told the Financial Times: “Benidorm was the creator of the biggest industry in Spain.”
In 1956, Pedro started the Plan General de Urbanismo — focusing on tourism as the fishing industry dipped in profits — and Benidorm started to really boom.
With an influx of visitors from abroad, the town’s tranquil olive groves were paved over, making way for the new high-rise buildings that the now-city is known for.
But Mr Zaragoza had no regrets about building over the beautiful landscape for the concrete that we know today.
“I realised if we built up instead of out, more people could have balconies, fresh air and sea or mountain views,” he said, according to The Guardian. “I’m proud of what we did for Benidorm.”
And in 1967, nearby Alicante Airport opened, fuelled by the explosion in package holidays from companies like Thomson, now known as TUI, with Brits flooding the resort’s beaches.
The disco era
Brits speak fondly of Benidorm’s golden years in the 1970s — especially its discos and cabaret bars that stayed open until the early hours.
The resort was now also filled with British pubs and fish and chip restaurants — a home from home for package holiday tourists from the UK.
And the buildings were getting taller too — the 30-storey, 90m Torre Coblanca was built in 1969, and the 89m Torre Benidorm was completed in 1971.
Today, Benidorm has the highest number of skyscrapers per capita in the world.
One TripAdvisor user wrote: “In 1978, overseas holidays were usually a fortnight once a year if you could afford it.
“We were unable to fly with Thomson from Newcastle, and had to get an overnight bus to Luton — home of the package holiday.
They added: “I remember in those days it was the tradition to applaud the captain on landing.
“Now there are a couple of flights each day from Newcastle and the applause is no more.”
Another TripAdvisor user looked back at the places they used to visit — and lamented the changes.
They said: “A group of us 1970s workers visited Benidorm in early April 2011, it was fascinating looking what my old work places had become.”
They continued: “The Western Saloon has become Richards New Look Bar, the Istanbul Disco looks like a store for the Hotel Diplomatic, and Tramps Disco is now a lap dance bar.
“Some of the other places where I socialised were still there, but Bar Calou in the old town is now a sex shop, the Ex Bar is bricked up and Jack’s Scottish Bar is now a tile shop.”
Behaviour gets more outrageous
After Spanish dictator General Franco died in 1975, attitudes were relaxing towards sex in Spain — with a rise in strip bars in Benidorm as a result.
Benidorm legend Sticky Vicky moved to the city at this point to take advantage of the wild night-life.
Her X-rated act involved the pulling out of objects from her vagina — including light bulbs, handkerchiefs, razor blades, eggs and sausages.
Vicky performed in the city until 2015 when she retired, and she even featured on the Benidorm TV show.
Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh revealed that he took a lads holiday to Benidorm in 1975 and it was as wild.
With things getting more risque on stage in Benidorm, Brits were also beginning to run wild on its streets.
“When I was about 17, I went to Benidorm with a bunch of 20 guys and it was a completely crazy, debauched holiday,” he told The Telegraph.
“It was a sort of ‘idiots abroad’-type trip with a lot of drinking and partying. I’m surprised we came back alive.”
Brits made a bad name for themselves in the 1980s as even more flocked to the resort, as a result of higher wages in the UK giving them more cash to splash.
But this also meant loutish behaviour from groups of youths — which began to become the norm.
Foreign stag and hen dos also became popular, even among the cash-strapped, thanks to the strength of the pound.
Pubs in the so-called British Square were, and still are, where people flocked to for cheap drinks, dancing and to pull after dark.
In recent years things have got out of control when it comes to drunk Brits on holiday and locals have complained about the situation their city is now in.
Last year a shock video emerged of a Benidorm holiday-maker having sex with a prostitute in broad daylight.
Brits also flocked to a swingers’ club nearby to the town — with hundreds of UK couples have also been posting internet ads seeking a holiday hook-up.
And this week locals are called for tougher measures on raucous stag and hen parties in the area who they say are “uncivic”.
In 2016, at the request of local party Ciudadanos, Benidorm council agreed to draw up a list of rules to regulate boozy behaviour — as already in force in Magaluf where tough fines are being handed out.
Last month, a ban was introduced on motor scooters in a tourist crackdown to prevent them from being a risk on the pavements, with fines up to $790.
Tourism chiefs say they “won’t tolerate” bad behaviour, especially from the Brits who flock to the resort each summer.
Deputy spokesperson of Ciudadanos, Juan Balastegui, said Benidorm has just experienced “a black weekend” and there had been numerous calls to the police.
He said stag parties were currently at their peak with many Brits travelling to Benidorm for their pre-wedding celebrations.
He claimed that in some of the beach areas, young women were so worried that they wouldn’t walk near the groups and there was also a general feeling of insecurity.
Juan also alleged that some of the tourists ended up in such a state that they had to be admitted to hospital and therefore took urgent beds away from local people who really needed them.
Last year, a group of lads walking around “half naked” were ordered to cover up or face a hefty fine, while four Brits were arrested as they prepared to scale one of the highest buildings in Benidorm with the intention of base jumping off the roof — facing fines of up to €300,000 ($472,700).
Cheap deals on beer can easily be found with pints priced as low as €1 ($A1.60), along with a full English breakfast for the same price.
It is all a far cry from the town’s origins as a humble fishing village with a beautiful beach — although many Brits wouldn’t have it any other way.
It may soon come to an end however, as hoteliers “declared war” against Brits last year who were being wasteful, from leaving the airconditioning on all day to using three new towels per day.
This could have contributed to the drop in British tourists that has recently been reported, after Benidorm found overnight stays dropped by almost half a million, blaming the popularity of other tourist destinations and a lack of airspace.
Despite this, a cheap deal from the UK can still be found — sometimes for under $182 per person.

An American tourist in Poland is facing the possibility of 10 years in jail after he admitted he tried to steal from the former Auschwitz death camp.
The man, 37, tried to take a metal part of the infamous railway tracks leading to the gatehouse of the Auschwitz II-Birkenau camp, according to police.
A police spokeswoman in the southern Polish town of Oswiecim told the Associated Press the man was charged with attempted theft of an item of cultural importance, which could attract a penalty of 10 years in jail.
The man admitted to his crime and has been released as he awaits the next steps, the spokeswoman said.
The memorial museum’s security discovered the man was trying to remove the metal piece from the railways tracks and called police, museum spokesman Pawel Sawicki said.
The railway tracks were used during the Holocaust to deliver people from all over Nazi-occupied Europe to their deaths at Auschwitz, with the tracks stopping metres from the camp’s notorious gas chambers.
More than 1.1 million people were murdered at Auschwitz, including about a million Jewish people.
The tourist was charged just weeks after the Auschwitz Memorial, which preserves the site, told visitors to stop posing for photos on the railway tracks.
“When you come to @AuschwitzMuseum remember you are at the site where over 1 million people were killed,” the memorial’s official Twitter account said, republishing photos of tourists balancing on the railway beams.
When you come to @AuschwitzMuseum remember you are at the site where over 1 million people were killed. Respect their memory. There are better places to learn how to walk on a balance beam than the site which symbolizes deportation of hundreds of thousands to their deaths. pic.twitter.com/TxJk9FgxWl — Auschwitz Memorial (@AuschwitzMuseum) March 20, 2019
“Respect their memory. There are better places to learn how to walk on a balance beam than the site which symbolises deportation of hundreds of thousands to their deaths.”
The post received mostly positive feedback from social media users.
“This is a very necessary post, our picture taking habits are completely out of control,” one Twitter user named Fransesca said in response.
Another person, Moran Blythe, tweeted: “I don’t understand why people use Auschwitz as a photo op or how they take cheerful selfies at a site that saw the murder of thousands of innocent people.”
This isn’t the first time the memorial site at Auschwitz has been targeted by thieves and vandals.
In one of the most dramatic cases, in 2009, someone stole the sign on the camp’s main entrance gate bearing the Nazi slogan “Arbeit Macht Frei”, which translates to “Work Sets You Free”. It was later found cut up into pieces.

How to make money and keep your home safe as an Airbnb host
Airbnb disasters and how to avoid them 1:09
A Kiwi family was shocked to discover a hidden camera in their Airbnb while on holiday in Ireland.
Nealie and Andrew Barker were travelling Europe with their five children and had checked into a number of different holiday rentals as a family.
But as the New Zealand Herald reported, the Barkers had never come across anything like this.
When they reached their accommodation for the night of March 3, the family trip took an odd turn.
Andrew, who is an IT consultant, had noticed something odd when connecting his phone to the house Wi-Fi. There was a device registered to the network called “IP Camera”.
Out of curiosity, he was able to connect to the device, and to his and Nealie’s horror, it provided a live video feed of the family.
“Andy hacked the live feed and called the owner to ask what the fudge sticks was going on,” Nealie wrote on the family travel blog sixfortwelve.
“We were all watching ourselves on his mobile phone.”
They found the camera overlooking the lounge and kitchen area of the Airbnb.
They had already paid in full for three days’ stay at the accommodation but no longer felt comfortable in the house.
The Barker family felt they had taken a lot in their stride while travelling but this was shocking.
Nealie felt “immediately protective” about her family and children being on camera.
They made the decision to decamp to a nearby hotel instead.
They have since contacted both the owner of the property and Airbnb who leased it to them.
The owner initially denied any knowledge of the camera and hung up on their phone call, the family told Stuff.
But after persisting, he eventually admitted to having installed a camera to “protect his investment”, although he would not tell the family if it was recording audio from the house, or if any video had been captured of the Barkers.
There was no mention of cameras in the property listing on Airbnb.
The process of getting a response from the rental website had been “hopeless” the Barkers said, and it was several weeks before they heard any outcome.
The letting website Airbnb has since apologised to the Barkers and issued a full refund.
Airbnb had since “removed this bad actor from (their) platform”.
The website’s privacy policy forbids cameras from being hidden and covering bedrooms or bathrooms. Those on the property for security must be properly disclosed before a reservation is made.
“In Ireland you have to let people know they are being filmed, it’s the law. Also, I think, if you’re not comfortable with people in your house, don’t rent it out,” said Nealie.
The Barkers said less tech savvy guests might not have noticed the camera.
It was in a private part of the house and could have easily captured images of children or intimate moments from previous people staying at the property.
It is unclear whether Airbnb has contacted previous guests of the property regarding concealed cameras.
The company has been contacted for further comment.

British Prime Minister Theresa May has held talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as she works to break the Brexit deadlock.
The Labour leader says his meeting with Ms May was \'useful but inconclusive\', with both sides agreeing to further meetings.
Despite the Prime Minister\'s calls for national unity, Ms May\'s decision has cost her two ministers, with Brexit Minister Chris Heaton-Harris and Nigel Adams from the Welsh Office both choosing to step down.
The EU has warned British lawmakers they must pass a deal by April 12 to avoid a long delay, as the block prepares for the European Parliamentary elections in May.
Britain\xe2\x80\x99s House of Commons has rejected a plan to hold more indicative votes on Brexit.
MPs were tied on the amendment, voting 310-310 but Speaker John Bercow voted against it in accordance with the conventions of the House. Mr Bercow said the last time a vote in the Commons ended in a tie was in 1993.
It came as Prime Minister Theresa May met opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to seek a way out of a Brexit stalemate, a gamble that could see a European Union divorce deal finally clear parliament but also tear her party apart.
Both sides described the talks as “constructive”.
The United Kingdom was supposed to leave the EU last Friday, but, nearly three years after Britons narrowly voted for Brexit in a referendum, it is still unclear how, when or even whether it will quit the bloc.
After her EU withdrawal deal was rejected three times by MPs, with parliament and her Conservative Party hopelessly divided over Brexit, Mrs May said she would talk to the Labour Party leader in a bid to overcome what is now a national crisis.
“There are actually a number of areas we agree on in relation to Brexit … what we want to do now is to find a way forward that can command the support of this House and deliver on Brexit,” Mrs May told parliament.
However, by approaching Mr Corbyn, a veteran socialist loathed by many of Mrs May’s Conservatives and mocked by Mrs May herself as unfit to govern, she risks further inflaming divisions in her party.
Two junior ministers quit on Wednesday.
“It now seems that you and your cabinet have decided that a deal — cooked up with a Marxist who has never once in his political life put British interests first — is better than ‘no-deal’,” Nigel Adams said as he resigned as a minister for Wales.
Mrs May turned to Labour after a hardcore Eurosceptic group of Conservatives repeatedly rejected her divorce deal, saying it would leave Britain a “vassal state”.
Labour wants to stay in a customs union with the EU, raising the likelihood of a “soft” Brexit option that keeps Britain’s economy closely aligned to the world’s biggest trading bloc.
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the government would accept a soft Brexit if parliament voted for it.
Mrs May said on Tuesday she would seek “as short as possible” a delay to the current Brexit date of April 12, having repeatedly said she did not want Britain to have to take part in European parliament elections on May 23.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he believed EU leaders were open to further delay and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would “fight until the last minute” for an orderly British exit.
But European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said Britain would not get any further short delays unless its parliament ratified a deal by April 12 — the date set by EU leaders as the effective cut-off for avoiding the European parliament elections.
Meanwhile Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned on Wednesday that Britain still faced an “alarmingly high” risk of a no-deal Brexit, which could happen suddenly and by accident without politicians fully intending it.
The idea, promoted by some Brexit supporters, that Britain could effectively trade on World Trade Organisation terms with zero tariffs after a no-deal Brexit was “absolute nonsense”, Mr Carney added in the interview with broadcaster Sky News.
Mr Carney said that as long ago as August last year, he had described the chance of Britain leaving the EU without any transition deal as uncomfortably high.
“It’s alarmingly high now,” he said.


British MPs have endorsed Prime Minister Theresa May\xe2\x80\x99s request to the European Union to delay Brexit until June 30, adding weight to the pitch she will make to EU leaders in Brussels.
The majority of Mrs May’s Conservative Party voted alongside the opposition Labour Party to back the prime minister’s approach by 420 votes to 110 at a vote in parliament.
The main rebellion came from pro-Brexit Conservatives who want Brexit to happen sooner.
“We should all be very clear what this extension would be for — it is all about making sure we leave the EU in a timely and orderly way and that means leaving with a deal,” government Solicitor-General Robert Buckland said ahead of the vote.
The debate came as Mrs May travelled to Berlin and Paris to drum up support for her request for more time to try and find a new plan for Britain’s EU exit that can command the support of her political opponents at home.
The vote itself was the culmination of an unprecedented power grab in parliament by MPs who this week passed a law against the government’s wishes, seeking guarantees that Mrs May would not let Britain leave the EU without a deal on April 12.
But because Mrs May has already requested a delay, and with no alternative dates chosen to be voted on by MPs, the vote was not a major flashpoint in the country’s long-running political crisis over how to deliver Brexit.
Nevertheless, the process of passing a law to trigger the debate has further undermined Mrs May’s political authority, proving parliament is able and willing to circumvent the government if they disagree with her choices on Brexit.
Labour Party junior Brexit spokesman Matthew Pennycook said his party supported Mrs May’s extension plan, but warned the extra time must be used to try and find a compromise with Labour and not to pass her own thrice-rejected deal at a fourth attempt.
“The public will not forgive the government if an extension is sought and agreed under the pretence of efforts to secure cross-party compromise,” he said.


WARNING: GRAPHIC
A woman who claims an Australian cricketer began to rape her while she was asleep has told a British court the “sick” attack left her in a state of shock.
Giving evidence at the retrial of former Worcestershire all-rounder Alex Hepburn, the complainant said she had not kissed him and wrongly believed she was having sex with his then teammate Joe Clarke.
Prosecutors allege Hepburn, 23, raped the woman at a flat he shared with Clarke in Worcester in April 2017 during the first weekend of a sexual conquest “stat game” set up on messaging app WhatsApp.
A jury of six men and six women has been told the woman had consensual sex with Clarke after a night out in which she had drunk wine, schnapps, vodka and Jagerbombs.
Hepburn, who denies rape, is alleged to have attacked the “dozing” woman after entering Clarke’s bedroom while the England Lions batsman was asleep in a bathroom.
Cross-examining the complainant on the second day of the retrial on Tuesday, defence counsel Michelle Heeley QC suggested the woman either regretted or could not remember kissing Hepburn at the start of sexual activity lasting up to 20 minutes.
The alleged victim, who cannot be named, told the jury she “had no reason” to open her eyes as she thought she was with Clarke at the cricketers’ shared flat in Portland Street, Worcester.
“We didn’t have sex, he (Hepburn) raped me,” the woman told the court.
“My eyes weren’t open.” Ms Heeley then asked: “For 20 minutes your eyes never opened once?” Addressing jurors from behind a curtain shielding her from Hepburn’s view, the complainant replied: “I don’t think the timings are accurate. My eyes were closed — I was asleep.
“He didn’t introduce himself to me. Because I thought it was Joe I had no reason to open my eyes. I didn’t realise there were sick people in this city.”
Asked if she had opened her eyes, looked at Hepburn and then kissed him to start the sexual activity, the woman told Miss Heeley: “Absolutely no way. I didn’t get a say in it.
“I was asleep when it started — that’s the bit you are missing from all of this.”
During her evidence, the woman said she was unable to remember some details of the night when she was first spoken to by police, around an hour after a passer-by saw her in the street and called for help.
Answering questions put to her by prosecutor Miranda Moore QC, the woman said Hepburn had attacked her about 5am and she had given initial details to a police officer about 6.25am.
Describing what sort of state she was in when she spoke to the officer, the woman told the court: “Horrendous. I couldn’t stop shaking, I remember being cold, just shocked.”
Hepburn has pleaded not guilty to two counts of rape, claiming that kissing led to sexual contact he believed was consensual.
The trial continues.


Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are following in the footsteps of Princess Diana.
Princess Diana\xe2\x80\x98s injury shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have killed her, the UK\xe2\x80\x99s top forensic pathologist argues in a new book.
Dr. Richard Shepherd, who investigated the death of the Princess of Wales, says her “very tiny” injury — a tear in a vein — only caused her death because it was in the wrong place, hidden deep in her lung.
“Her specific injury is so rare that in my entire career I don’t believe I’ve seen another,” Shepherd writes in a new book, extracted in the Daily Mail.
“Diana’s death is a classic example of the way we say, after almost every day: if only,” Shepherd continues. “If only she had hit the seat in the front at a slightly different angle. If only she had been thrown forward 10mph more slowly.”
Injuries the royal mum-of-two sustained in the 1997 car crash in a Paris tunnel proved fatal.
But one thing that could have saved her was totally within her control, Shepherd argued.
“If only she had been wearing a seatbelt,” he writes. “Had she been restrained, she would have probably appeared in public two days later with a black eye, perhaps a little breathless from the fractured ribs and with a broken arm in a sling.”

Naked protesters storm the Commons, and Parliament has voted against all four Brexit options as Britain debates how best to leave the European Union.
British Prime Minister Theresa May says Britain will seek another delay to Brexit in hopes of winning Parliament\xe2\x80\x99s approval of a deal on the terms of its withdrawal from the European Union.
Mrs May said after a seven-hour Cabinet meeting that she will try to have cross-party talks with opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to try to break the Brexit logjam in parliament.
“We will need a further extension of Article 50, one that is as short as possible and which ends when we pass a deal,” she said. “And we need to be clear what such an extension is for, to ensure we leave in a timely and orderly way.”
“Today I am taking action to break the logjam. I am offering to sit down with the leader of the opposition and to try to agree a plan that we would both stick to ensure that we leave the European Union and that we do so with a deal.”
The British leader’s statement comes amid building concern that the country will leave the EU on April 12.
That’s the deadline the EU’s 27 remaining countries gave the UK for leaving the bloc or coming up with a new plan.
Politicians in the House of Commons have voted three times to reject an agreement Mrs May struck with the EU.
It comes as Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said Ireland does not want to become a “back door” into the EU single market for Britain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
“We don’t want Ireland to be a back door to the single market, anymore than anybody wants us to become a back door to the single market,” Mr Varadkar said after a meeting in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron.
Mr Varadkar said he was committed to preventing goods that do no meet EU norms from entering Ireland or the EU.
“In the unlikely event that we have a no-deal and the UK were to do trade deals with the US or China and we had chlorinated chicken or hormone beef, or products made by child labour in Asian countries, the last thing we would want is that coming south of the border into the Republic of Ireland.
“And we certainly wouldn’t want it getting through the Republic of Ireland into the European Union,” he said.
But he again reiterated his opposition to creating a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, for fear that it could jeopardise peace in the British province.
Mr Varadkar said that while physical inspections would be necessary on imports like live animals, they could be done at ports in Northern Ireland rather than in the Irish Republic.
“That is the right and best place for them,” he said.
But the British government has refused to envisage carrying out customs checks on goods arriving in northern Ireland from Britain, arguing that to do so would drive a wedge through the United Kingdom.
The EU’s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said that the EU was working with Ireland “on a unilateral basis in the event of no deal, to know where we can do these checks,” but refused to elaborate further.


The European Union are expected to grant the British Prime Minister a second delay to Britain\'s exit from the bloc. Rough cut (no reporter narration)
European Union leaders on Thursday offered Britain a delay to its EU departure date until Halloween.
Leaders of the 27 remaining EU member states met for more than six hours before agreeing to postpone Brexit until October 31, two officials said.
The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed- door negotiations.
European Council President Donald Tusk confirmed in a tweet that an extension had been agreed to, but he did not disclose the date.
EU27 has agreed an extension of Art. 50. I will now meet PM @theresa_may for the UK government's agreement. #Brexit — Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) April 10, 2019
May, who had sought a delay only until June 30, still has to agree to the offer.
EU leaders spent a long dinner meeting wrangling over whether to save Britain from a precipitous and potentially calamitous Brexit, or to give the foot-dragging departing nation a shove over the edge.
May pleaded with them at an emergency summit to delay Britain’s exit, due on Friday, until June 30 while the UK sorts out the mess that Brexit has become.
Some were sympathetic, but French President Emmanuel Macron struck a warning note.
“Nothing is decided,” Macron said, insisting on “clarity” from May about what Britain wants.
“What’s indispensable is that nothing should compromise the European project in the months to come,” he said.
May believes that a June 30 deadline is enough time for Britain’s parliament to ratify a Brexit deal and pass the legislation needed for a smooth Brexit.
But British politicians have rejected her divorce deal three times, and attempts to forge a compromise with her political opponents have yet to bear fruit.
May spoke to the 27 EU leaders for just over an hour, before they met for dinner without her to decide Britain’s fate.
In contrast to some testy recent summits, there were signs of warmth and even humour. May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were filmed laughing over a tablet bearing an image showing the two of them speaking to their respective Parliaments on Wednesday wearing similar blue jackets.
Many leaders said they were inclined to grant a Brexit delay, though Macron had reservations after hearing May speak. An official in the French president’s office said the British leader hadn’t offered “sufficient guarantees” to justify a long extension.
Macron is concerned that letting Britain stay too long would distract the EU from other issues — notably next month’s European parliament elections.
“The no-deal situation is a real option,” said the official, who was not authorised to be publicly named according to presidential policy.
“Putting in danger the functioning of Europe is not preferable to a no-deal.”
Others suggested a longer delay would likely be needed, given the depth of Britain’s political disarray.
May signalled she would accept a longer extension, as long as it contained a get-out-early cause should Britain end its Brexit impasse.
“What is important is that any extension enables us to leave at the point at which we ratify the withdrawal agreement,” May said as she arrived in Brussels. She added that she was hopeful it could be as soon as May 22 — a key date since that would avoid the need for Britain to participate in elections for the European parliament.


An explosion in Paris has sparked a major fire.
A fast-moving fire has ravaged a residential building on the northern edge of Paris.
Local firefighters spokesman Gabriel Plus said there are no known victims in the Saturday night blaze.
The fire moved through four floors of the large building.
Rescue teams are still searching for potential victims.
It’s understood that more than 50 firefighters rushed to the scene to battle the blaze.
The spokesman told BFMTV that it is too early to know the origin of the fire.
He said it began on both the outside and inside of the building and raged through the third through sixth floors.
The building has two elevator shafts, which typically can spread flames.
Paris recorded its deadliest fire in a decade earlier this year, when a blaze in a posh western district killed 10 people in February. Arson was suspected in that fire.
More to come.


The royal couple Meghan and Harry have joined Instagram with a joint account.
Ever since Prince Harry and Meghan Markle met just under three years ago, it has been widely reported the Duchess\xe2\x80\x99 healthy lifestyle has rubbed off on the royal.
But now, with the couple expecting their first child any day, royal insiders have claimed Meghan and Harry want to raise Baby Sussex as vegan too — and apparently, the Queen isn’t thrilled.
According to Woman’s Day, while the Duke and Duchess want to raise their child on a plant-based diet, the Queen “won’t have it”.
“It’s created tense discussions between Meghan and Harry who doesn’t want to upset his grandmother,” an insider tells the publication.
“ … Meghan keeps pushing the boundaries with the royals, and it’s not being well received, least of all by Her Majesty.
“ … Bringing the baby up as a vegan simply won’t be tolerated by the monarch.”
If Meghan and Harry did want their child to follow a similar diet, it’s likely the young royal wouldn’t be completely vegan.
According to reports, Meghan only eats a plant-based diet during the week — and since meeting the 37-year-old, Harry has reportedly been opting for “less meat and more fruit and veg”.
The pair are also said to have been following a healthier lifestyle in the run-up to the birth.
While Meghan has always been a keen yogi, the pair are thought to have built a “floating yoga studio” at their new home in Windsor, which is reported to be decorated “in vegan paint”.
Royal sources have claimed the Duchess — who once joked she’s a “hippie chick” — has requested Frogmore Cottage be kitted out with its own mother-and-baby yoga room complete with a “floating” floor.
The royal is understood to enjoy vinyasa yoga and hot yoga and used to regularly post snaps to her social media.
On a visit to Birkenhead earlier this year, 34-year-old Harry told Buddhist monk Kelsang Sonam he practised meditation “every day”.
Meghan — who is thought to be due this month — is reported to be having an “all natural birth”, with bookies slashing odds she’ll have Baby Sussex at Frimley Park hospital.
Kensington Palace has declined to comment.

A teenager has died in front of horrified tourists after he fell more than 30 metres from the Whispering Gallery at St Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Cathedral in London.
The cathedral was closed for hours after the boy fell from the famous tourist attraction at 4pm on Monday, UK time.
City of London Police said they were not treating his death as suspicious.
A witness told the Daily Mailthe boy died while the cathedral choir was practising.
“My mum was in the choir practising for Evensong when it happened in front of the choir. So tragic,” a woman told the publication.
Other witnesses reported hearing a “huge noise” before people started “screaming” inside the church.
In order to visit the Whispering Gallery in the cathedral, visitors climb more than 250 steps to reach the top.
An architectural quirk means visitors can whisper on one side of the dome and be heard on the other side.
The cathedral was reopened on Tuesday at 10am UK time.
The teenager’s death comes less than two years after another young person died inside the Anglican cathedral.
Medical student Lidia Dragescu, 23, died after leaving the same gallery at the top of the cathedral.
The Romanian student visited the Whispering Gallery every Sunday with her mother before taking her own life in 2017.
“Although robust procedures for emergency situations are in place at St Paul’s, and today’s response bore that out, it does not lessen the shock we feel as a close community, especially for those of us who witnessed and responded to this incident,” St. Paul’s Cathedral said at the time.

Great sitcoms are still being made, Just not in Australia. what happened to the most popular genre of television.
Fawlty Towers has been named as the greatest British sitcom of all time, with credit going to a \xe2\x80\x9csix-foot-five comic genius\xe2\x80\x9d.
The list of the 20 best British sitcoms has been compiled by a panel of television experts for Radio Times magazine.
John Cleese has been credited with channelling his rage as the highly-strung Basil Fawlty, proprietor of a sub-par Torquay hotel, which made the series a hit.
Fawlty Towers came top of the list ahead of other series including Father Ted, Blackadder, I’m Alan Partridge and Only Fools And Horses.
The BBC series ran for just two series of six episodes each in the 1970s.
Speaking to the Radio Times, co-writer and co-star Connie Booth said: “Fawlty Towers succeeds, I think, because it allows infantile rage and aggression a field day in a buttoned down, well-mannered English society.
“It’s unique in being a farce, with all the plot surprises and precision that the style requires. And it doesn’t hurt that the star of the show is a six-foot- five comic genius. If he was shorter I can’t imagine how it would have worked.”
Cleese added: “I was very lucky to be working at the BBC when decisions were taken by people who had actually made programmes.
“What a cast. I’m proud we are up there with Porridge and Only Fools and Ab Fab and Blackadder and The Office and Reggie Perrin and The Thick of It.”
Channel 4 sitcom Father Ted, penned by Arthur Mathews and Graham Linehan, came second in the list, while I’m Alan Partridge came third.
The list was voted for by 42 comedy expert including lauded writers Mathews, Linehan and Richard Curtis, as well Barry Cryer and Alison Graham.


Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, is due to give birth this month and is being urged to skip the traditional photocall outside the hospital after her baby arrives.
Both Kate Middleton and Princess Diana appeared outside their maternity wards to proudly reveal their new royal babies, but some parents have claimed it puts pressure on new mums, reports The Sun.
When Kate stepped out to present Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, she looked flawless with perfect make-up and a bouncy blow dry by her hair stylist Amanda Cook Tyler.
But Chelsea Hirschhorn, CEO of parenting company Fridababy, hopes Meghan break’s the tradition.
She wrote in an open letter: “Dear Royal Mum-To-Be,
“You will soon give birth to one of the most anticipated babies in the world and like your princess predecessors, you’ll be expected to parade outside of the hospital in front of throngs of photographers to show off your new bundle of joy shortly after giving birth.
“You’ll smile, you’ll wave, you’ll be radiant, but between your legs will be a whole different story.
“Sure your blowout will be perfect for your hospital step photo-op, but people will be opening on all the wrong things — like how soon you will fit into your pre-baby wardrobe — instead of having an honest conversation about what women go through during birth and immediately after.
“But us mums will know that while you wave from that step you’ll be one pair of mesh underwear away from your first post-baby poop (brace yourself)!

MORE: Meghan’s unlikely Aussie celeb feud
“Spoiler alert: Bringing a new life into the world usually starts with your vagina, and the aftermath is a mess.
“The bleeding and swelling will linger, peeing will burn, and sitting like your old self will feel like a herculean feat.
“And if it’s a C-section, there’s a whole host of other issues to tend to.”
Ms Hirschhorn added that no matter how glamorous Meghan may look on the day, she “won’t feel like herself”.
She said: “When the ‘big reveal’ day arrives but you’re feeling like all the King’s horses and all the King’s men couldn’t put your vagina back together again — use this stage to do your part for all women.
“Skip the pomp and circumstance of the baby parade.”
She added: “If you really can’t skip it, then at the very least flash us a glimpse of the mesh underwear underneath to keep it real.”
Although the letter is intended to be tongue-in-cheek, it serves as a reminder as to how unreasonable it is to expect women to look perfect after birth, including the royals.
According to royal correspondent Emily Andrews, a source revealed that Meghan might indeed skip the tradition for her birth.
The insider said: “Harry and Meghan realise there is intense public interest but this baby is not a direct heir to the throne and they want the birth to be as private as possible.
“Meghan is nervous about complications such as an emergency Caesarean and doesn’t want the pressure of having to look immaculate on the hospital steps just hours later.
“Like any anxious first-time mum, she’s worried about the birth itself.
“As she is over 35, she is considered a slightly older mum — which sometimes can lead to some complications.
“Meghan also has the added stress of the world’s attention on her — everyone wants to catch the first glimpse of the new royal addition.
“She and Harry have decided that rather than go somewhere as public as the Lindo they will allow Meghan to recover somewhere more private.
“She just wants a normal, natural birth and to bond with her baby, without being primped and blow-dried to within an inch of her life just for the pictures.”
Last year actress Keira Knightley, criticised 37-year-old Kate’s seemingly perfect post-baby appearances.
She said the fact that Kate “was out of hospital seven hours later with her face made up and high heels on” felt unrealistic and not achievable for a lot of women.

Get a taste of all the ABBA hits and all the colour of the 2018 Australian production of Mamma Mia! The Musical
ABBA\xe2\x80\x99s Bjorn Ulvaeus has revealed that fans can expect a new song \xe2\x80\x9cin September or October\xe2\x80\x9d from the four-member Swedish pop group that broke up 37 years ago.
Ulvaeus told Denmark’s Ekstra Bladet newspaper that “it takes an extremely long time” to make the video with the avatars of the group members, adding “it has been delayed for too long”.
The band earlier said Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Agnetha Faltskog reunited to plan a virtual tour featuring digital avatars, and that the two new songs are titled I Still Have Faith In You and Don’t Shut Me Down.
ABBA shot to fame by winning the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest with Waterloo, and had big hits in the 1970s including Dancing Queen before splitting up in 1982.
Fans rejoiced last April when the group announced that they had recorded two new songs for a “Virtual ABBA” experience.
The project first announced in 2016, and was scheduled to premiere, via digital versions of band members, at the end of last year.
At the time, Benny Andersson said in an interview on the fan site IceTheSite legal complications had delayed the release.
“When that press release [about the TV show and recordings] came out, everything was up and running smoothly, then it didn’t run as smoothly,” he said. “We are still trying to establish the agreement that needs to be done to be able to continue. We are good. It’s the other side, everything that has to be done, everything that has to be drawn. It’s delayed. It’s not our doing.”
Anderson has also said that the group could record a third song as well.
“We may do another one when the show [launches],” he said in an interview posted last month. “And that’s gonna take another six — eight months. The reasons we did the new songs was to put them in the new show. Now when this show comes up these songs will be old because they [will have been released when the show launches]. So we said we need to do another one for the show.”
He also spoke about how the group had enjoyed being back together again.
“We had such a good time, we really, really did, we were all back to where we ended, having fun. It was just like no time had passed, we all felt that and we were all happy about feeling that.”
In a statement last April, the group said: “The decision to go ahead with the exciting ABBA avatar tour project had an unexpected consequence. We all four felt that, after some 35 years, it could be fun to join forces again and go into the recording studio. So we did. And it was like time had stood still and that we only had been away on a short holiday. An extremely joyful experience!
“We may have come of age, but the song is new. And it feels good.”


Michaella McCollum Connolly tells her story on Irish channel RTE One. Courtesy RTE One
Michaella McCollum, a drug mule from Northern Ireland, is looking to cash in after talks about a TV show based on her book about her criminal life as a drug mule.
The 25-year-old mum-of-two has been trying to build a glamorous career since leaving a Peruvian prison three years ago for smuggling 11kg of cocaine worth £1.5 million ($A2.7 million) in August 2013.
McCollum was supposed to release her book House of Women last year, giving her account of her time in the South American slammer, but publication was postponed.
Originally from Dungannon in Northern Ireland, the infamous smuggler has now met with a TV production company in London to bring her shocking story to the small screen, the Mail on Sunday reports.
If the Narcos-style program gets the go-ahead, McCollum is set to become “very rich from it”, a source claimed.
“True crime dramas have never been more successful, and companies are always looking for the next one,” the source said.
“There is huge demand. Real life is often stranger than fiction. Think Netflix series Narcos, based on druglord Pablo Escobar, or The People vs. OJ Simpson.”
FEMALE CRIME STORY
The anonymous insider added McCollum’s story would be especially titillating as few true crime series are about women.
They said: “That will be a major hand to play for Michaella — a young, attractive woman finds herself involved in the world of international drug trafficking and ends up languishing in a grotty Peru prison.
“It’s a great story, what’s not to like?”
McCollum’s potential earnings could be supplemented by releasing the book at the same time and picking up paydays from related modelling work and a speaking tour.
McCollum and Melissa Reid were named “The Peru Two” when they were busted trying to smuggle cocaine out of Lima, Peru’s capital city, six years ago.
COKE BUST
They were sentenced to six years and eight months in prison but were released in 2016, and ex-model McCollum is now on the books of management company BLVK.
The firm’s other clients include reality TV stars from Geordie Shore and Ex on the Beach, such as Gaz Beadle and Sarah Goodheart.
McCollum posted a snap on Instagram last week of her walking down a London road with the caption: “Successful meeting with production company. What would you like to see the book turned into?”
True crime TV shows have exploded in popularity in recent years since murder mystery podcast Serial triggered widespread interest in the genre in 2014.
Making of a Murderer, The Jinx and The Staircase have all been huge successes with international audiences.
And the recent Netflix series The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann has sparked renewed intrigue into the world’s most famous missing person case.

Apple and Oprah has delivered some big surprises at its 2019 launch. A streaming service, a games arcade and digital credit card were some of the big reveals.
Britain\xe2\x80\x99s Prince Harry has announced that he is teaming up with US media titan Oprah Winfrey on a documentary series for Apple about mental health.
The Duke of Sussex, who is set to become a father this month, will jointly create and executive produce the upcoming mental health-themed show with Winfrey, according to Kensington Palace, his official residence.
“I am incredibly proud to be working alongside Oprah on this vital series which we have been developing together for several months,” the prince said in a statement.
“Our hope is that this series will be positive, enlightening and inclusive — sharing … the opportunity for us to understand ourselves and those around us better.”
Tech titan Apple, which will air the multi-part documentary, recently launched into the television streaming market to take on Netflix and Amazon.
The partnership with Winfrey, who has decades of experience as one of America’s foremost talk show hosts, will focus on both “mental illness and mental wellness”, Kensington Palace said.
Its creators hope to inspire viewers “to have an honest conversation about the challenges each of us faces, and how to equip ourselves with the tools to thrive,” it added.
No details were released on a time frame for the new documentary series. Harry — whose American wife Meghan is weeks away from giving birth to the couple’s first child — has advocated on mental health issues alongside his other charity work in recent years.
He has previously revealed that for a long time he struggled to cope with the death of his mother Diana in a Paris car crash in 1997, and sought professional help a few years ago.
After a decade in the British army — serving two tours of duty in Afghanistan — the duke launched in 2017 the “Heads Together” mental health initiative with his brother Prince William and sister-in-law Kate.
It was spearheaded by their philanthropic and charitable arm The Royal Foundation.


An infant school has hired someone to change nappies because so many kids aren\xe2\x80\x99t toilet trained.
Schools in Walsall, England have warned many children lack basic skills such as dressing themselves or holding a pencil properly.
Chris Towe, Walsall council’s portfolio holder for education, said he’d spoken to the heads of 80 infant and primary schools in the borough and was “shocked” by what they’d told him.
“We are talking about five-year-olds here, and it is not acceptable,” Mr Towe said.
Schools told him kids could not communicate properly and didn’t know how to use cutlery when eating.
Describing it as a “massive issue”, Mr Towe told the BBC: “I was quite shocked really. If they haven’t got basic skills, how can they be educated?
“This cannot go on. If it doesn’t stop, it is going to get even worse.”
At a Walsall council meeting he said: “Clearly, over the years, many parents have not been taking responsibility in making sure their children are ready for school.”
Diane Coughlan, a Labour councillor, said the borough was home to many struggling families with a variety of issues.
She said: “For many parents, school readiness is simply not a priority for them, so apart from simply sending a letter, what other support will they be given?”
A study in February suggested parents were too busy to potty train their children early enough — not recognising the strain the delay puts on their bladders and bowels.
A survey of early years staff by charity ERIC and the National Day Nurseries Association revealed 68 per cent of them felt that over the past five years children were being potty trained at a later age.
It came after a watchdog warned teachers had become stand-in parents, dealing with everything from toilet training to knife crime.
Ofsted boss Amanda Spielman said it did not leave teachers enough time to teach kids to read and write.
The chief schools inspector warned many parents had given up responsibility for discipline, healthy eating and manners.
In December last year she said: “Schools cannot be expected to act as substitute parents or provide a panacea to all societal ills.
“They have more than enough to focus on.”
She said the growing number of kids unable to use a toilet was “difficult for teachers, disruptive for other children and a terrible social impact on the children affected”.

Naked protesters storm the Commons, and Parliament has voted against all four Brexit options as Britain debates how best to leave the European Union.
The United Kingdom could be nearing the end of the line on Brexit with a Friday deadline that could see the country crash out of the European Union with no deal.
Prime Minister Theresa May is frantically trying to reach an agreement with the opposition after her divorce plan was voted down three times in the UK parliament.
She admitted on Saturday that there was “no sign (the deal) can be passed in the near future”, appealing to the Labour Party to work with her to find an agreement.
“I think there are some things we agree on ... so we’re talking,” she said in a placatory video shared on social media on Saturday. “It’ll mean compromise on both sides.”
Let me explain what\'s happening with Brexit.pic.twitter.com/gjGkvFk8fT \xe2\x80\x94 Theresa May (@theresa_may) April 7, 2019
But it looks unlikely that her Conservative Party and Labour will be able to nail down a compromise as emotions run high in the bitterly divided nation.
“We haven’t seen anything from government that would suggest that they are prepared to change any part of the deal going forward,” shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told the BBC. “Obviously that is disappointing.”
Some members of the Tory party were furious at Mrs May for opening up to Labour and a potential “soft” Brexit, with two ministers resigning last week and party members taking photos of themselves tearing up their membership cards.
‘FLEXTENSION’
Brexit was supposed to happen on 29 March, but the EU has allowed an extension to Friday 12 April. The UK needs to “indicate a way forward” by this date to avoid leaving the bloc without a deal.
If Mrs May can persuade Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to agree to a broad Brexit vision, she may have a chance of being granted a short extension to 30 June by the EU.
That would mean the UK has to take part in European elections on 23 May, something the Prime Minister was hoping it would not have to do.
If she cannot agree on a plan with Mr Corbyn, only extreme options will remain.
On Wednesday, Mrs May will meet the European council in Brussels for a second special Brexit summit, and will ask for a 30 June extension.
At the first summit in November, the 27 heads of state agreed to a withdrawal deal — but the UK Prime Minister has failed dismally to have it passed by the UK parliament.
With it looking increasingly unlikely that Mrs May can cajole MPs into anything like an agreement, EU members have proposed a variety of solutions.
European Council President Donald Tusk has suggested a “flextension” — a year-long extension, with the option of the UK leaving the EU earlier if a withdrawal agreement is reached.
But many EU members are nervous about keeping a reluctant UK in the bloc, and fear MPs would simply continue to kick the can down the road.
France wants to get tough, and give the UK just two weeks to find an agreement or leave without a deal.
‘TOXIC RECIPE’
Not everyone thinks a “no-deal” Brexit would be a disaster. Tory MP Andrea Leadsom said it would not be “nearly as grim as many would advocate” and that the bottom line was that Britain is leaving the EU.
Hardline Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg tweeted on Sunday: “If we are stuck in we must use the remaining powers we have to be difficult.”
Mr Rees-Mogg was attacked by Germany’s minister for European affairs Michael Roth, who slammed the Conservative MP’s comment as “out of order”.
Some are hoping the UK may never leave the EU, others insist the government must follow through on the people’s vote, and many are predicting a change of leadership.
Britain has been in meltdown for months now, and with the chaos only worsening, Mrs May’s position looks dire. Last month, she even offered to resign if parliament would pass her deal. It didn’t work.
More than half of Britain thinks the country is “in a state of decline” and more than half said they wanted a “strong leader willing to break the rules”, according to an annual political audit by think tank the Hansard Society.
Just 25 per cent of those surveyed said they had confidence in MPs’ handling of Brexit, and 72 per cent said the system of governing needed “quite a lot” or “a great deal” of improvement.
Hansard Society director Ruth Fox warned the pessimism and lack of trust was a “potentially toxic recipe for the future of British politics”.


The royal couple Meghan and Harry have joined Instagram with a joint account.
Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has been trolled on her official Instagram account with Prince Harry just hours after it launched.
The Duchess of Sussex was targeted in cruel racist jibes on the couple’s first social media post — as the royal account amassed a record-breaking two million followers overnight.
It comes after Kensington Palace was revealed to be spending hours moderating and deleting abusive comments aimed at the former actress and Kate Middleton, reports The Sun.
Within 14 hours of launching, the Instagram profile — @sussexroyal — amassed two million subscribers, making it the fastest account to gain such a high number of fans.
But trolls also took time to leave abusive comments on the page.
Among the stream of positive comments, cruel comments called the couple “royal parasites”, with one writing “run Harry, run”.
Another criticised the work that the couple do, with one writing: “Getting make-up and hair done, wearing designer clothes and shaking hands? Is this work? Hmmm.”
The Sun chose not to share further racist remarks.
It was previously reported that the abuse has become so severe that staff are now said to be seeking the help of Instagram to try and combat the problem.
Staff have even reportedly struggled to delete all the cruel comments.
The royal family declared war on internet trolls last month, warning the worst offenders would be reported to police.
The social media guidelines read: “We reserve the right to hide or delete comments made on our channels, as well as block users who do not follow these guidelines.
“We also reserve the right to send any comments we deem appropriate to law enforcement authorities for investigation as we feel necessary or is required by law.”
The moves to block abusers and pursue the worst legally follow growing alarm at trolls targeting Kate and Meghan.
From insults about their personal appearance, to ludicrous claims that Meghan, 37, is sporting a “fake” pregnancy bump, the trolling ranges from the ridiculous to the rather concerning.
Despite the trolls, the couple’s welcome to social media has been overwhelmingly positive.
The new @SussexRoyal account broke the Guinness World Record for being the fastest to gain one million Instagram followers in just five hours and 45 minutes.
It smashed the previous world record held by K-pop star Kang Daniels, who gained a million followers in 11 hours and 36 minutes.
WELCOME TO INSTAGRAM
Sharing their very first post, Harry and Megan wrote: “Welcome to our official Instagram; we look forward to sharing the work that drives us, the causes we support, important announcements, and the opportunity to shine a light on key issues.
“We thank you for your support, and welcome you to @sussexroyal — Harry & Meghan.”
The couple also posted a selection of images taken over the past couple of years — including those from royal walkabouts and tours.
And with the Duke and Duchess set to welcome their first child in a matter of days, it looks like the new social media account could have some adorable photographs of Baby Sussex pretty soon.
Meghan is said to be due to give birth this month and while the sex of the baby has not been announced, royal bookmakers have experienced a flurry of bets lately that the Duchess of Sussex is expecting a girl, who she plans to name Elizabeth.
Instagram’s policy states: “We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages.

Polish Catholic priests condemning magic burned dozens of books they considered to be sacrilegious, including works from the Harry Potter series.
The SMS from Heaven Foundation — an evangelical group — posted photos of the burning at Gdansk’s Mother of Church parish on Sunday on Facebook, saying in Polish: “We obey the Word.”
The post continued with several passages from the Bible, including one from the Acts of the Apostles, saying “many of those who had practised magic collected their books and burned them in front of everyone. So they calculated their value and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver”.
The post, which has gone viral, shows three priests carrying a basket of books and other items, including an African-style face mask through a church to an outside fire pit. A priest and altar boys are watching the book burning.
Other items burned included a Hello Kitty umbrella and a Hindu religious figure.
The Polish episcopate and local bishop acknowledged the burning, but declined to comment, AFP reported.
The foundation said the book burning was intended to alert parishioners to bad influences that it says comes from magic and the occult.
According to an unnamed parishioner from the church, people were asked to bring items linked to “negative energy” and superstitious beliefs.
The post sparked controversy on Facebook with some calling it a joke.
“Seriously? Are people burning fantasy literature in the 21st century in some kind of sick ritual?!” one person wrote in the comments section. “It’s hard for me to believe that we’re so backward!”
Others supported the book burning, with one commenter saying: “Get rid of everything that does not please God and see how your life will change.”
The Harry Potter series, by British author J.K. Rowling, tells an epic story of good and evil. The stories focus on the adventures of bespectacled young wizard Harry Potter, who fights against the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort.
Since it was launched in 1997, it has sometimes drawn criticisms from religious and conservative circles for its focus on witchcraft. More than 500 million copies have been sold worldwide.
In the US, there have been at least six book burnings of the series.
Rowling has not publicly commented on the book burning. In the past, she has argued that the books encompass all religions.

A man says his life has become a living hell since his identical twin was jailed for horrific paedophilia offences last week.
On Friday a Welsh Court sentenced Gavin Evans, 42, to four years for crimes including grooming and sharing images of girl as young as four being sexually abused.
Evan also engaged in highly sexualised online conversations with vulnerable young children for months in the lead up to his arrest.
But Evans’ identical twin brother Owen says his life has since become a nightmare because he keeps getting mistaken for the convicted paedophile.
“I F*****G KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN!!!!!” Owen Evans wrote in a Facebook post on April 2 alongside a photograph of the pair.
“TO EVERYONE IN SWANSEA THE STORY IN THE PAPERS ABOUT TESCO WORKER BEING A PAEDO....ITS NOT ME BUT MY TWIN F*****G BROTHER SO PLEASE BEFORE PEOPLE START SPREADING SH*T ABOUT ME GET YOUR F*****G FACTS RIGHT AND KEEP MY FAMILY OUT OF THIS.
“MY FIANCE (name withheld) DOESN’T DESERVE THIS SH*T BEING APPROACHED BY PEOPLE IN THE STREET GETTING HARRASSED THIS F*****G STOPS NOW!!!! PEOPLE ON MY FRIENDS LIST WHO KNOWS IM NOT BULLSH*TTING PLEASE SHARE...I LIVE IN SWANSEA THE PAEDO IS ON THE RIGHT!!!! THAT F****R IS IN JAIL!!!!”
Mr Evans said he feared he would be labelled a pervert by complete strangers for the rest of his life.
“I will have a lifetime of people calling me a paedophile – I am going to be constantly looking over my shoulder,” he told Metro.
“My partner was accused of living with a paedo. I shouldn’t have to move or defend myself against something I haven’t done.”
Mr Evans told the paper he had no idea about the scale and nature of his brother’s crimes until his sentencing hearing and was “mortified” upon learning the horrific details.
The offences included grooming young girls into sex acts and videoing them, sharing an intimate video of a 14-year-old girl with at least a dozen other paedophiles, and storing Category A images showing extreme abuse on his phone.


Thousands of fans have lined the streets of Australia and New Zealand for a chance to meet the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, received 236 baby gifts on their recent tour of Australasia, including clothes, books, stuffed toys and a baby lifeguard outfit.
The royal couple will hardly have to buy anything new for their upcoming arrival, who is due later this month.
An official register of the presents shows they were handed at least 97 soft toys and teddies, including 11 koalas, five kangaroos, four kiwis and one echidna.
There were ten baby blankets and three shawls with at least eight pairs of baby socks, 14 booties, 14 vests and two bibs.
The couple also received two didgeridoos, three boomerangs and a large toy box to keep everything in.
More than 100 books were also given to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, which included many favourite children’s stories.
Australians were the first to offer Meghan gifts following her baby announcement.
The couple will keep some of the gifts ar their new home at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, while the rest will either be kept in storage or given away to charity.


An Australian cricketer accused of committing rape during a sexual conquest had slept with 20 women during a similar competition a year earlier, a court has heard.
Former county all-rounder Alex Hepburn denies raping a woman who claims he began attacking her while she was asleep at his flat in Worcester in April 2017.
A retrial at the city’s Crown Court has been told the complainant contacted police after realising she was in bed with Hepburn and not his then teammate Joe Clarke.
Prosecutors allege Hepburn, then aged 21, raped the woman, who was also aged in her 20s, in a bedroom while Clarke, who had been sick, was asleep in a bathroom.
During his evidence on the third day of his trial, Hepburn said the woman made eye contact with him and then kissed him, instigating a “normal” sexual encounter lasting about 20 minutes.
Hepburn — who posted the rules of the competition on a WhatsApp group in the week before the alleged rape — told jurors he was confused when the woman pushed him off and asked: “Where’s Joe?”
Hepburn, who came to the UK aged 17 to join the Worcestershire side, said of the alleged rape: “I got onto the mattress, that’s when I first realised there was a woman in the bed.
“This woman rolled towards me, we made eye contact, and she kissed me.”
Hepburn, now 23, added he could see the woman’s eyes were open and she had instigated the kissing at his flat in Portland Street, Worcester.
“She was engaging in the act, so I presumed she was enjoying it,” Hepburn said on Wednesday.
Asked about the moment the woman is alleged to have realised she was not with Clarke, Hepburn added: “She said, ‘What are you doing?’ to which I replied, ‘What do you mean?’
“I was confused why she had asked me that question. It was no different to a normal sexual encounter.”
Hepburn’s defence barrister, Michelle Heeley QC, asked him: “Had it occurred to you that she might have thought she was having sex with Joe as opposed to you?”
Hepburn answered: “No.”
The court has heard the alleged victim, who had been drinking wine and spirits, had earlier had consensual sex with Clarke who she had met in a nightclub.
At the start of about 90 minutes of testimony, Hepburn admitted he sent “disgusting, horrible and embarrassing” WhatsApp messages while setting the rules of the sexual conquest competition.
Jurors were told Hepburn jokingly referred to rape in one of the messages on the “stat chat” group set up to keep a score of women its members had slept with.
Describing the group as a silly competition, Hepburn said some of the messages referred to threesomes — while another confirmed that women who cricketers had previously slept with did not count.
During cross-examination, Hepburn told prosecutor Miranda Moore QC that up to six cricketers had taken part in the so-called stat game in 2016.
Hepburn then denied he had regarded himself as “God’s gift to women” and dismissed a rule of the game stipulating women should be rated out of 10 as “just immature chat to speak with each other”.
Asked to give a “ball-park” figure for his score the previous year, Hepburn told the court: “20.”
The trial continues.


Marijuana hasn\'t always been illegal, but now the Australian Greens Party are pushing for the legalisation of recreational cannabis. So should we reassess \'the war on drugs\'?
A mum has broken down in tears after her supply of medicinal cannabis for her severely epileptic daughter was confiscated by authorities at an airport in the UK.
Emma Appleby, and her daughter Teagan, 9, were travelling back to Britain from Holland carrying a three month’s supply of medical cannabis oil, valued at $8,400 where it was seized after they landed at Southend Airport in Essex.
Teagan, who has a rare chromosomal disorder as well as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, can suffer up to 300 seizures a day if she is left untreated.
She suffered a seizure while on the plane, reports ITV News.
Appleby, an avid campaigner for the legalisation of medicinal cannabis, said she was “devastated” that she wasn’t allowed to enter the UK with the appropriate medicine for her child after collecting it from a pharmacy in Rotterdam using their own and fundraised money.
“I’m devastated. I’ve always tried to do the right thing. I’ve jumped through all the hoops but ended up being passed from pillar to post and being met with a flat ‘no’,” she said.
“All I want is the best thing for my daughter.
“I’ll fight to get it back.”
Policy reforms made last November aimed to make access to medical cannabis legal but parents in the UK have reportedly been struggling to secure prescriptions, in part due to the reluctance resonating from the medical community.
Ms Appleby claims she had no choice but to take matters into her own hands by seeking medical cannabis outside of the UK, only to return to have it all taken from her.
“I’m really gutted,” she said. “They just took everything.”
Ms Appleby suspects authorities at the airport had been informed of her arrival, most likely through social media.
“They knew apparently, they have been notified from social media.
“I hadn’t said where we were coming in but obviously everyone knew, all you’ve got to do is put it on the passport.
“They asked me at border control how long we were away for.
“I thought, ‘They’re asking questions as if someone’s notified them’.
“Then they asked if I had anything to declare, there were loads of them waiting so I knew if I said no I was going to get myself in deeper so I just yes.”
Border staff were told not to destroy the medicine but to seize it and hold it, and Ms Appleby hopes to apply for an import licence to get it back.
A government spokesman said: “The decision to prescribe cannabis-based products for medicinal use is a clinical decision for specialist hospital doctors, made with patients and their families, taking into account clinical guidance.
“It is unlawful to import unlicensed cannabis-based products for medicinal use to the UK without the prescription of a specialist doctor and a Home Office importation licence.
“Border Force has a duty to enforce the law and stop the unlawful import of controlled substances into the UK”.


He\'s making headlines globally, but what exactly is going on with Julian Assange, Ecuador and the UK?
Julian Assange has been arrested after he was kicked out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London almost seven years after seeking asylum.
In a statement, Metropolitan Police confirmed the Wikileaks founder had been taken into custody and then was “further arrested on behalf of the United States”.
Police said they were “invited into the embassy by the Ambassador, following the Ecuadorian government’s withdrawal of asylum”.
In a video capturing Assange’s arrest, the bearded 47-year-old could be seen being dragged out of the embassy in handcuffs, clutching a book.
“The UK has no freedom. The UK has no stability. The UK must resist,” Assange appeared to yell as he was dragged into a police van by four Scotland Yard detectives.

The book Assange was clutching as he was dragged down the embassy steps was History of the National Security State by Gore Vidal.
The novel “discusses the historical events that led to the establishment of the massive military-industrial-security complex and the political culture that gave us the ‘Imperial Presidency’,” its Amazon description reads.
Assange is due to appear in a London court later today and Australia has requested consular access.
ASSANGE ‘FURTHER ARRESTED ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES’
The Wikileaks founder has been living in the embassy for almost seven years after a warrant was issued for his arrest on June 29, 2012 when he failed to surrender to Westminster Magistrate’s Court.
But Assange isn’t just facing criminal charges in the UK, he’s also facing treason charges in the US after he released thousands of classified government documents through Wikileaks.
Jen Robinson, who has previously represented Assange as his lawyer, confirmed the 47-year-old was arrested “not just for breach of bail conditions but also in relation to a US extradition request”.
Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne said consular officers would seek to visit Assange at his “place of detention” in London police station.
“Mr Assange will continue to receive the usual consular support from the Australian Government,” Ms Payne said in a statement.
“I am confident, as the United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt publicly confirmed in July 2018, that Mr Assange will receive due process in the legal proceedings he faces in the United Kingdom.”
Wikileaks had previously expressed fears Assange’s arrest for violating his bail conditions in the UK would be used as a pretext to extradite him to the US.
Metropolitan Police confirmed Assange had “been further arrested on behalf of the United States authorities” after he arrived at central London police station.
“This is an extradition warrant under Section 73 of the Extradition Act. He will appear in custody at Westminster Magistrates’ Court as soon as possible,” police said.
Through Wikileaks, Assange published the Afghanistan War Diary, a collection of some 90,000 mainly secret US government documents relating to the military engagement of Allied forces in Afghanistan, in July 2010.
Three months later, WikiLeaks published 400,000 classified documents in its Iraq War Diary.
Criminal charges were filed against Assange by the US Justice Department back in 2012 related to the publication of the classified documents which humiliated and exposed the government.
Wikileaks has since responded to Assange’s dramatic arrest, specifically calling out the CIA.
This man is a son, a father, a brother. He has won dozens of journalism awards. He\'s been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize every year since 2010. Powerful actors, including CIA, are engaged in a sophisticated effort to dehumanise, delegitimize and imprison him. #ProtectJulian pic.twitter.com/dVBf1EcMa5 \xe2\x80\x94 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 11, 2019
‘THE PATIENCE OF ECUADOR HAS REACHED ITS LIMIT’ — ASSANGE’S END
Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno took to social media to explain why Assange had been kicked out of the embassy, claiming the Australian-born computer program had repeatedly violated international conventions.
The “aggressive and discorteous behaviour (of Assange), the hostile and threatening declarations of its allied organisation against Ecuador, and especially the transgression of international treaties have led the situation to a point where the asylum of Assange is unsustainable and no longer viable,” President Moreno said.
In a sovereign decision Ecuador withdrew the asylum status to Julian Assange after his repeated violations to international conventions and daily-life protocols. #EcuadorSoberano pic.twitter.com/pZsDsYNI0B \xe2\x80\x94 Len\xc3\xadn Moreno (@Lenin) April 11, 2019
In his video, President Moreno said Ecuador had “protected the human rights” of Assange for six years and ten months.
Mr Moreno said the Wikileaks founder had repeatedly been asked to “respect and abide by the rules” but the “patience of Ecuador has reached its limit on the behaviour of Assange”.
The Ecuadorian president also claimed Assange “installed electronic and distortion equipment” and “blocked security cameras” in the embassy.
He also accused him of “mistreating guards” and “accessing security files in the embassy without permission”.
Assange originally sought asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in June 2012 after Swedish police charged him with sexual assualt.
The Wikileaks founder was facing extradition from those charges however the probe was later dropped. Assange also strongly denied the charges.
Assange’s relationship with his hosts collapsed after Ecuador accused him of leaking information about President Moreno’s personal life.
Mr Moreno had previously said Assange has violated the terms of his asylum.
The president said that he had asked Britain to guarantee that Assange would not be extradited to a country where he could face torture or the death penalty.
“The British government has confirmed it in writing, in accordance with its own rules,” Mr Moreno said.
Via Twitter, UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid praised the arrest and said “no one is above the law”.
Nearly 7yrs after entering the Ecuadorean Embassy, I can confirm Julian Assange is now in police custody and rightly facing justice in the UK. I would like to thank Ecuador for its cooperation & @metpoliceuk for its professionalism. No one is above the law \xe2\x80\x94 Sajid Javid (@sajidjavid) April 11, 2019
In a statement, the Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Sir Alan Duncan, said the UK was grateful to Ecuador.
“It is absolutely right that Assange will face justice in the proper way in the UK. It is for the courts to decide what happens next,” Sir Duncan said.
“We are very grateful to the government of Ecuador under President Moreno for the action they have taken.
“Today’s events follow extensive dialogue between our two countries. I look forward to a strong bilateral relationship between the UK and Ecuador in the years ahead.”
Ecuador gave Assange citizenship in December 2017 but he has long been an annoyance for the staff at the embassy.
The 47-year-old lost his wifi in the embassy in March last year after Ecuadorian officials accused him of using the internet to try and influence other countries politics.
President Moreno disputed Assange’s loss of internet in his statement today, saying he has had a mobile phone the entire time to “communicate with the outside world”.
Assange sued the Ecuadorian government in October, accusing the country of violating his civil rights.
The lawsuit came after embassy staff limited Assange’s visitors and demanding he had to clean his bathroom and care for his cat.
‘DARK MOMENT FOR FREEDOM’
Assange’s case has opened up explosive debate about security and free speech.
His supporters view him as a crusader who fearlessly exposes injustices such as torture and alleged war crimes committed by the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The 47-year-old Australian’s critics accuse him of cosying up to authoritarian leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and putting Americans’ lives at risk.
Fugitive former US government contractor Edward Snowden — himself wanted for leaking details of secret US surveillance programmes — called Assange’s arrest a “dark moment for press freedom”.
Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Britain of “strangling freedom”.
Assange’s mother Christine tweeted that she had been advised that her son faces up to 12 months in a British prison.
“Our focus is as always to STOP a U.S. Extradition!” she wrote.

Ever ridden with an elephant, or got a selfie with a tiger in Bali or other animal parks? Chances are these parks are committing acts of animal cruelty and the animals are suffering in horrible conditions
Holiday-makers are being urged to stop riding donkeys up Santorini\xe2\x80\x99s steep steps in a new campaign on the idyllic Greek island.
Distressing images of the donkeys struggling up 600 zigzagging steps while weighed down by obese tourists sparked fury last summer.
In response to the outrage, fat tourists — or those weighing more than 100kg (15.7 stone) — were banned from riding on the donkeys in October last year.
And now a campaign aimed at all holiday-makers is ready to be launched by activists in collaboration with the cruise-line industry.
“The campaign is about to start,” said Nikos Zorzos, the island’s mayor, The Guardian reported.
“Representatives from the cruise liner association were here in my office this week promising to raise awareness (of the problem) and from our side we’ll be distributing information leaflets.
“Our mules and donkeys are part of our tradition. Younger owners, especially, have understood that they need to be looked after.”
The animals have long been used to carry people from the volcanic isle’s port to its main settlement 400 metres above sea level.
But as tourist numbers have soared in recent years, the donkeys have been forced to make four or five return journeys up the cobbled steps on the cliff-side path in searing temperatures.
The Greek island’s famous donkeys have been struck down with spinal injuries, saddle sores and exhaustion after being forced to carry the increasingly heavy cargo.
They work long hours, seven days a week without shelter, rest and water.
Last summer, more than 108,000 people signed an online petition deploring what it described as the “mindless and unnecessary torture (of equines) used as cruel transportation for people who want the ‘real Greek’ experience”.
In response to this, the country’s Ministry of Rural Development and Food published a new set of regulations regarding donkeys’ wellbeing.
These state donkeys giving tourists rides in Santorini should not carry any loads heavier than 100kg, or one-fifth of their weight.
A government statement read: “The owners of working equidae should ensure that the animals’ level of health is high.
“Under no circumstances should be used animals unfit for work i.e., ill animal, injured, animals in an advanced pregnancy as well as animals with poor maintenance of hooves.
“The animals should be given appropriate and adequate food and fresh drinking water daily, into containers which cannot be contaminated and are cleaned at least once a day.
“Working equines should not be loaded with excessive weight for their size, age or physical condition. The load cannot exceed the weight of 100kg, or one fifth of their body weight.”
In June, charities there claimed the explosion of fat tourists meant locals who are keen to get the most out of their animals were being forced to crossbreed the animals to create mules, which are bigger and taller and can carry heavier loads with more stamina.
Elisavet Chatzi, 45, a volunteer from Athens who participated in peaceful protest in Santorini over donkeys’ treatment there earlier this year, said: “It’s a very big step, I think all our hard work has paid off.
“The situation in Santorini has been going on for many years and it cannot be resolved in one day.
“We have won our fight because of the international media attention on the topic. No one could ever believe that new regulations would be set.
“The next day after the bulletin was released, I was told a tourist had been carried up the hill by three different donkeys, so as not to exhaust them.”
But other campaigners allege that despite the reminder, nothing has changed on the island and there is still a long way to go.
Maria Skourta, 42, the leader of the Athens branch of Direct Action Everywhere, claims: “We were content with the bulletin because the purpose of our organisation is to bring matters to light and initiate conversation.
“But our goal is not to improve the lives of slaves, it’s to free them entirely.
“While this means they will stop carrying fat tourists, the donkeys are still forced to carry cement, appliances and all sorts of heavy weights.”

He\'s making headlines globally, but what exactly is going on with Julian Assange, Ecuador and the UK?
Supporters of Julian Assange have gathered outside the Ecuadorean Embassy in London after fears were raised that the WikiLeaks founder was about to be expelled.
The anti-secrecy organisation said its sources in Ecuador had revealed Mr Assange could be removed from the building “within hours to days”.
Yesterday, WikiLeaks tweeted that its founder would be turfed out of the embassy in London where he has lived for more than six years.
BREAKING: A high level source within the Ecuadorian state has told @WikiLeaks that Julian Assange will be expelled within "hours to days" using the #INAPapers offshore scandal as a pretext--and that it already has an agreement with the UK for his arrest.https://t.co/adnJph79wq \xe2\x80\x94 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 4, 2019
It is understood the source was regarded as credible by WikiLeaks. Ecuador’s foreign ministry released a statement saying it “doesn’t comment on rumours, theories or conjectures that don’t have any documented backing”, but a senior Ecuadorean official said no decision had been made.
Britain’s foreign secretary said Assange is a “free man” and can leave the Ecuadorian embassy in London whenever he chooses.
Jeremy Hunt said Assange “can leave that embassy whenever he wants to, so we want the situation resolved as quickly as possible.”
Assange hasn’t left the embassy since August 2012.
Supporters arrived at the embassy throughout Friday morning, holding up posters and signs calling for Mr Assange to be allowed to leave without fear of being arrested.
WikiLeaks believes Mr Assange will be extradited to the United States if he leaves the building.
MORE: Ecuador denies it will give Assange the boot
A top Ecuadorean official said President Lenin Moreno was angered by the apparent hacking of his personal communications.
But the official said while Mr Moreno was angered by the apparent data breach, he denied WikiLeaks’ claim and said no decision had been taken to expel Assange from the embassy.
The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorised to discuss the matter.
On Tuesday, Mr Moreno blamed WikiLeaks for recent allegations of offshore corruption that appeared in local media outlets and the publication of family photos to social media.
Mr Moreno accused WikiLeaks of intercepting phone calls and private conversations as well as “photos of my bedroom, what I eat, and how my wife and daughters and friends dance”.
He provided no evidence, and WikiLeaks has denied any involvement. WikiLeaks in a statement called Mr Moreno’s charges “completely bogus”, saying it reported on the accusations of corruption against the president only after Ecuador’s legislature investigated the issue.
A van arrived at the London embassy bearing a billboard in support of Mr Assange, and parked in a space reserved for diplomats.
The man who arranged the board and gave his name as Fethi said: “I’m here to support Julian Assange. We just wonder if the police will take him away.”
Mr Fethi, who briefly went into the embassy before he was escorted out by officials, said he does not believe Mr Assange will be expelled.
“We’re going to be staying here until we see what’s going on,” he said. A picture on the billboard showed Mr Assange gagged by an American flag with the message #FreeSpeech.
A member of staff inside the six-storey building declined to comment.
Mr Assange has been living inside the embassy for almost seven years. A statement from Mr Assange’s legal team said: “Expelling Julian Assange would be illegal, violate international refugee law and be an attack on the UN which has repeatedly called for Assange to be able to walk free.
“It will be a sad day for democracy if the UK and Ecuadorean governments are willing to act as accomplices to the Trump administration’s determination to prosecute a publisher for publishing truthful information.”
A senior Ecuadorean official said no decision has been made to expel Julian Assange from the country’s London embassy despite tweets from WikiLeaks that sources had told it he could be kicked out within “hours to days.”
A small group of protesters and supporters of the WikiLeaks’ founder gathered Thursday local time outside the embassy in London where Assange has been holed up since August 2012.
He has feared extradition to the US since WikiLeaks published thousands of classified military and diplomatic cables.


The stars of Game of Thrones have promised viewers plenty of \'twists, turns and bloods\' during the award-winning show\'s final season.
Season eight premiers on Foxtel on the 15th of April.
Some Game of Thrones fans are deeply knowledgeable about every obscure corner of the world. Then there are some who still describe main characters as \xe2\x80\x9cthe girl with the hair.\xe2\x80\x9d
If you’re the second kind of fan, this is a New York Post guide for you.
This show is so big, it’s impossible to avoid — but not everyone has time to rewatch (or even watch!) previous seasons. If you’re only vaguely familiar with the story but you don’t want to miss out on attending watch parties, here’s a handy guide so you won’t have to annoy everyone by asking questions.
RELATED: TYRION LANNISTER LORDS IT LARGE
THE CONFLICT
Going into the final season, there are two main issues at hand:
1) Who will ultimately end up on the world’s least comfortable chair, the Iron Throne (if anyone — maybe it’ll dissolve into a democracy!).
2) How will humanity defeat the encroaching threat of zombie-like White Walkers to ensure that there even is a land full of humans to rule, when all is said and done?
For the first conflict, there are three main contenders for the throne. There’s Queen Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey), who’s already on it. She obtained it through shady means (literally blowing up her enemies) and will do anything to keep it.
Then there’s Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), whose father ruled before the events of the show. Unfortunately, he didn’t do a great job and, uh, burned his own subjects alive for fun. He was removed from power and Dany grew up far away from Westeros in order to stay safe from political enemies. She’s finally back now, and she sees the Throne as her birthright.
Then there’s Jon Snow (Kit Harington). He doesn’t want the Throne, he’s not a natural politician and he’s spent most of his life as an outcast. He’s risen to power not because he wants it, but because he’s stepped up when he has to.
Going into Season 8, Jon doesn’t actually know yet that he has a claim to the Throne. Few people do. Unbeknown to most, his real father is secretly Dany’s older brother, which puts Jon ahead of her in the line of succession. To further complicate the matter, Jon has sworn allegiance to Dany and, uh, they’ve become a couple.
So that should be interesting when the news of Jon’s real parentage is revealed.
As far as the second conflict, the encroaching zombie army, goes, not everyone believes that White Walkers are real. They’ve grown up being told it’s a myth, fake news, etc. So it’s hard to rally the realm to fight a threat only half of them believe in.
Zooming in on the individual characters, there are a lot, yes. But luckily, there are several main families who are most central.
THE STARKS
The Starks began the story as our wide-eyed heroes, the honourable family who rule the North in a fancy house with a cool name (Winterfell). Along the way they’ve suffered terrible losses — most notably, both parents and the oldest brother. The four surviving members — Arya, Sansa, Bran and Jon — have been separated for long periods of time, and all have gone through terrible ordeals.
Arya (Maisie Williams) is now an assassin, Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) has weird magic powers, Sansa (Sophie Turner) has become a shrewd politician, Jon has died and been resurrected. Jon is currently the leader, known as the King in the North. None of them (except Bran) know that Jon is really their cousin and not their father’s son.
So as the show winds down, they’re in for tearful reunions, family drama and dramatic revelations.
THE TARGARYENS
Members of House Targaryen are known for their silver hair, and they’re a rare breed, as most have been slain by political enemies. Daenerys thinks she’s the last living Targaryen. So both she and Jon are in for a shock when they discover that he too is secretly a Targaryen.
Since Dany’s dad (and Jon’s grandfather) was such a terrible king before the events of the show, most people won’t be enthused about the prospect of Targaryen rule by either Dany or Jon. Also, they have dragons, which are a big deal because they haven’t existed for hundreds of years.
THE LANNISTERS
There are three Lannisters left standing: twins Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and Cersei, who have been lovers for most of their lives (yes, yuck). And Tyrion (Peter Dinklage), who was only close with Jaime. Both Cersei and their late father hated him for being a dwarf. A convoluted series of events led to him killing their father (which makes Cersei hate him even more, and she wants to kill him).
Cersei currently sits on the throne while Tyrion is an adviser to her enemy and rival, Daenerys. At the end of Season 7, Jaime also got fed up with Cersei’s megalomania and left her, riding North to help fight the White Walkers (the invading army of ice zombies threatening all human life — no big deal).
Back in Season 1, they began the story as antagonists of the Starks. But going into Season 8, both Tyrion and Jaime are their allies, and only Cersei is their real antagonist.

Prince Harry has many titles: Earl Dumbarton. Baron Kilkeel. Keg Monster. (OK, I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing the last one.) He is also the UK\xe2\x80\x99s favourite member of the royal family according to a 2018 poll. The red haired-charmer even pipped his beloved granny and corgi breeder, the Queen, to take out the top spot.
However, the latest official announcement from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s press office means we can add another title here: hypocrite.
Overnight it was revealed Harry and Meghan had no plans to briefly front the media after the birth of their first baby, which has been de rigueur for the Windsors since Princess Anne, her bouffant and newborn Peter Phillips did it in 1977.
A press release put out by the Instagram-loving duo read: “Their Royal Highnesses have taken a personal decision to keep the plans around the arrival of their baby private. The Duke and Duchess look forward to sharing the exciting news with everyone once they have had an opportunity to celebrate privately as a new family.”
While it is totally understandable they would want to revel in this life-changing moment as a threesome, this announcement uncomfortably highlights Harry and Meghan’s disregard for the contract, like it or not, they have with the British people.
Firstly, Harry has been royal his entire life, while Meghan has had a scant year to get used to the structures and rules that come with being an HRH. Either way, being a member of the royal family means not only being part of a very grand family who own $6 billion worth of jewellery (true story) and more castles than you can count on two hands but acknowledging that role comes with certain (unpleasant at times) responsibilities.
“We don’t want to dilute the magic … The British public and the whole world need institutions like it,” Harry said in an interview with Newsweek in 2017. However, the viability and longevity of this particular institution depends on allowing the public some modicum of access to their lives, no matter how much they might resist it or resent it.
Being royal means, at times, subjugating your desire for privacy and agency to make certain life choices. In return, you get to maintain the good standing this archaic institution enjoys with the great unwashed.
Harry might be the “spare” but he is still the grandson, son and brother of monarchs, current and future. That role, no matter how much he might chafe against it, comes with some legitimate expectations from the rabble who make up the Commonwealth.
One of which is that you share monumental life moments, such as weddings and funerals, with the people whose ongoing endorsement and patronage you need to continue to occupy the position you do.
That extends to welcoming new sprogs into the Windsor family too.
I am not saying Meghan should, in this instance, be expected to front the press hours after giving birth, her hair perfectly coiffured, wearing a lovely frock and a rictus grin a la the Duchess of Cambridge.
Those images put physical and psychological demands on a woman who has just been in labour that border on the insensitive.
However, I don’t think it is overly demanding to think the Sussexes might share, say, a lovely shot of the three of them via Instagram, once Mum and sproglet are recovering nicely, in the day or so afterwards.
Secondly, I think the “privacy please” part of the announcement is disingenuous. This news comes only 48 hours after it was revealed Harry is partnering with Oprah and Apple TV on a groundbreaking series about mental health. I don’t think it is fair to use your position and profile for some things and reject it when it doesn’t suit you.
Harry and Meghan are cleverly and powerfully reshaping their roles to become global activists, which is a thrilling and very smart move. However, redefining what a royal does and what they represent does not negate the need to maintain the relationship the monarchy has with its people.
You can’t just decide to be royal and to enjoy the privilege and the platform that it gives you at some convenient moments and then eschew any royal obligation because you want to be Mr & Mrs Normal when it suits.
There is no getting away from the fact the royal family continues to exist only with the constant assent of the hoi polloi. Tending to that powerful psychic relationship, by letting the public into their lives, is part of the bargain.
And in 2019, that means a nice Instagram shot (once they deign to arrive) of the newest Windsor kidlet, thankyou.


The Russian President says he will not back down from a second Cuban Missile Crisis if the United States wants a nuclear stand-off.
If the United States deploys medium-range nukes in Europe, Vladimir Putin says Russia will set up hypersonic nuclear missiles, purported to travel nine times the speed of sound, off America\xe2\x80\x99s coast.
Mr Putin says \xe2\x80\x98nobody can prevent warships and submarines from navigating in neutral waters.\xe2\x80\x99
His remarks come after America announced its intention to withdraw from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced an ambitious program to secure Russia\xe2\x80\x99s dominance in the Arctic, including efforts to expand a nuclear icebreaker fleet.
Speaking at the Arctic forum in St Petersburg attended by leaders of Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden on Tuesday, Mr Putin said Russia, the only nation with a nuclear icebreaker fleet, was moving to expand it.
Russia has four nuclear icebreakers, and Mr Putin said three new such ships were under construction.
By 2035, Russia stood to have a fleet of 13 heavy icebreakers, including nine nuclear-powered ones, he said.
He also revealed Russia plans to dramatically increase cargo shipments across the Arctic sea route.
He said the amount of cargo carried across the shipping lane was set to increase from 20 million metric tons last year to 80 million tons in 2025.
“This is a realistic, well-calculated and concrete task,” Mr Putin said.
“We need to make the Northern sea route safe and commercially feasible.”
He noted Russia planned to expand the ports on both sides of the Arctic shipping route — Murmansk on the Kola Peninsula and Petropavlovsk- Kamchatsky on the Kamchatka Peninsula — and invited foreign companies to invest in the reconstruction project.
Other ports and infrastructure facilities along the route would also be upgraded and expanded, he said.
The Russian military has recently revamped and modernised a string of Soviet-era military bases across the polar region, looking to protect its hold on the area, which is believed to have up to one-quarter of the Earth’s undiscovered oil and gas.
Russia, the US, Canada, Denmark and Norway have all been trying to assert jurisdiction over parts of the Arctic as shrinking polar ice creates new opportunities for resource exploration and new shipping lanes.
Speaking at the forum, Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg emphasised the need to respect international law and noted the Arctic Council provided a key arena for dialogue.
“Now and then I hear the Arctic described as a geopolitical hotspot,” she said.
“This is not how we see it. We know the Arctic as a region of peace and stability.”
She noted “this should not be taken for granted,” adding “it is the result of political decisions and practical co-operation between the Arctic states”.
“Respect for international law and regional co-operation are keys to ensuring peace and stability across borders,” Ms Solberg said.
Ms Solberg and other leaders who spoke at the forum underlined the need for all countries in the Arctic region to focus on areas of mutual interest despite differences.
Addressing the forum, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said military deployments in the Arctic were intended to protect national interests.
“We ensure the necessary defence capability in view of the military-political situation near our borders,” Mr Lavrov said, noting a recent NATO exercise in Norway was openly directed against Russia.
Russia’s relations with the US and other NATO allies have plummeted to post-Cold War lows over Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea, the war in Syria, Moscow’s meddling in the 2016 US presidential election and other issues.
Mr Putin used the forum to criticise the US and the EU sanctions against Russia over its action in Ukraine, but emphasised they wouldn’t hamper the country’s plans to expand its presence in the Arctic.
He charged the US had used the economic restrictions as a tool to protect its economic interests, citing Washington’s opposition to a prospective pipeline under the Baltic Sea that would carry Russian gas to Germany as an example.
The Russian leader emphasised the challenges to the polar region posed by global warming, saying Russian scientists believe the climate is changing faster than indicated by earlier estimates.
“I wouldn’t like to see the Arctic turning into something like Crimea and Crimea becoming a desert due to our failure to take timely measures,” he said.
Putin said Russia had fulfilled its obligations under an international agreement aiming to limit global warming by cutting emissions of greenhouse gases, noting the US has opted out of the pact.
He voiced hope President Donald Trump would take the US back into the deal, adding without the involvement of the US, which accounts for a large share of global emissions, the agreement wouldn’t serve its purpose.


Game of Thrones actors spoke of their excitement to Sky News on the red carpet at the premier of season eight in New York.
The final season premiers on Foxtel on the 15th of April.
Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke has shared harrowing unseen photos from when she was hospitalised due to two brain aneurisms.
The British actress suffered the ordeal in 2011 when she was 24 — the same year the first season of Game of Thrones began — and at her lowest she asked medical staff to “let me die”, reports The Sun.
Photos of the now 32-year-old in hospital appeared on screen while she chatted to presenter Tracy Smith on US chat show Sunday Morning.
She told revealed during her chat: “With the second [aneurysm], there was a bit of my brain that actually died.
“If a part of your brain doesn’t get blood to it for a minute, it will just no longer work, it’s like, you short circuit.
“So I had that, and they didn’t know what it was. So they literally were looking at my brain going ‘well we think it could be her concentration, it could be her peripheral vision.’”
The actress then joked: “I always say it’s my taste in men. It’s no longer there.”

One photo shows Clarke resting as she checks her phone, while another harrowing image shows her looking at the camera with a tube coming out of her head and a large wound just above her hairline.
The actress — who plays Daenerys Targaryen in the hit series — feared she wouldn’t be able to act any more after her two aneurisms.
She explained: “There was all these funny things and for a very long time I thought it was my ability to act.
“I really, really did. That was a deep paranoia from the first one as well, what if something has short circuited in my brain and I can’t act any more.
“I mean literally it’s been my reason for living for a very long time.”
Clarke previously revealed how she felt as if an elastic band was squeezing her brain during a training session at the gym in 2011.
While there, the actress told how she had crawled to the locker room and was violently ill before being found by another gym user, who put her into the recovery position and an ambulance was called.
She made the admission in an essay for the New Yorker last month.
She said: “The diagnosis was quick and ominous: a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), a life-threatening type of stroke, caused by bleeding into the space surrounding the brain.
“I’d had an aneurysm, an arterial rupture. As I later learned, about a third of SAH patients die immediately or soon thereafter.”
Clarke also revealed how she also suffered from aphasia as a consequence of the brain trauma, adding: “In my worst moments, I wanted to pull the plug. I asked the medical staff to let me die.”
She was left unable to even remember her own name after treatment and panicked her acting career would be over.
The actress has since fully recovered and has thrown herself into creating a charity called SameYou which helps people recovering from brain injuries and strokes.

What is it about tragedy and loss that prompts people to take photos of themselves at sites like the 9/11 memorial, the Berlin Wall, Auschwitz and Chernobyl.
Once the most radioactive place on the planet, the void of the Chernobyl exclusion zone has been filled with gimmicky parties and stag groups.
Thirty-three years ago, this month, a failure at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant wiped the Ukrainian town of 55,000 off the map.
At the time, a cloud of radioactive material engulfed Europe. The effects of the contamination are thought to have caused 4000 premature deaths and still render an area the size of Luxembourg unsafe for the next 24,000 years.
But for some reason, this nuclear disaster zone has become a tourist magnet.
Two hours from Kiev, the destination has become a site for ravers and party makers and a blossoming disaster-tourism industry.
Around 20,000 tourists entered the former exclusion zone last year.
“Had a wonderful 2-Group tour with a couple of great lads” reads a glowing TripAdvisor review from Canada.
“Only thing that can be better is the lunch,” read a review of a similar tour, as if it were a day trip to the park.
There are around 50 such companies advertising a guided tour into the area, which up until recently was stalked by invisible death.
Budget hotels have sprung up in the woods around its fringes for around $40 to $135 a night.
However, around this dark tourism peak has appeared a number of niche offerings.
One such venture is Artefact.
Last December, hundreds of people attended the art-rave party that took place at the site.
In a blur of hazmat suits and neon glow sticks, the radiation gimmick was even extended to the catering: with isotope themed ice creams and Chernobyl Mr Whippies.
Tour operators are saying the site is extremely popular with stag-do’s and bachelor parties.
The frisson of death and unique location has proved popular with young, male guests to whom activities such as paintballing and zorbing are advertised.
“Everybody smile. Say ‘cancer’!” said a morbid photographer to the Telegraph travel editor, Oliver Smith, on a recent tour of the site.
However, there is a feeling of irreverence that some people feel borders on disrespect.
There has been huge backlash from Ukrainians who have lived with the horror of the disaster for decades.
“That thing killed my grandmother … and now it’s a disco?” wrote a horrified Russian on the Instagram post of Guardian reporter Tom Seymour.
The dark tourism controversy and backlash has only made the Artefact festival more popular.
They have held film screenings of the Russian film Stalker from 1979 that seemed to predict the disaster.
Festival founder Valery Korshunov told the Guardian:“They see this place as too sad and tragic for any kind of event. Others want to change the alienation zone, to fill it with new meanings.”
For all its insistence on finding “new meanings” operators like the Artefact festival have done well out of exploring “old wounds” in the Ukrainian psyche and cashing in on them.

China\'s spreading influence in Eastern Europe worries West

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members — or those hoping to join — could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.
Of the 16 participating countries — Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia — 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."

BERLIN (AP) — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.


Pro swim league to debut in US, Europe
LOS ANGELES (AP) — A new professional league for elite swimmers will debut this year with U.S. and foreign-based teams competing in a mixed gender format with athletes being paid.
Five-time Olympic champion Katie Ledecky will compete for one of the International Swimming League\'s eight teams — four based in the U.S. and four in Europe.
The league said Tuesday that the season will begin Oct. 4-5, with meets held nearly every weekend through Nov. 24. The top four teams will compete in the finals in Las Vegas on Dec. 20-21.
The U.S. will be represented by: the New York Breakers, the Los Angeles Current, the DC Trident, and the Cali Condors based in San Francisco.
The European teams will be based in London, Rome, Budapest and likely France.


European court: Russia\'s house arrest of Navalny unlawful
MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
Navalny, a leading opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed Tuesday\'s ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled Tuesday that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has left its policy promises and interest rates unchanged as it weighs looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
The ECB has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve in pausing the withdrawal of stimulus measures deployed over a decade to bounce back from the global financial crisis, as central bankers around the world ponder which way the economy is headed. The Fed has already started raising rates but has backed off plans for further rate increases in 2019.
The ECB\'s 25-member governing council was content to stand pat on Thursday, making no changes to its short policy statement. The bank took several steps to support the economy on March 7. Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.
The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4%, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year — if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3% for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8% from a peak of 12.1% in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3% from 3.5%.
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.

European researchers to drill for ancient Antarctic ice
BERLIN (AP) — A group of 14 European scientific institutions plan to retrieve the world\'s oldest ice as part of research into past climate change.
The consortium led by the Germany-based Alfred Wegener Institute said Tuesday it has identified an area in Antarctica, nicknamed "Little Dome C," that should harbor ice as old as 1.5 million years.
So-called ice core measurements are crucial for scientists\' understanding of past climatic changes on Earth and the models they use to predict future global warming or cooling.
Current ice core measurements provide reliable data going back only about 800,000 years.
At a meeting in Vienna, the institutes said they spent the past three years working with American, Australian, Japanese and Russian colleagues using radar to determine the best possible site for drilling.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.

DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) — China\'s prime minister has promised that Beijing will respect European standards and fair trade, seeking to allay concerns that it\'s flouting EU competition rules with huge investments on the continent.
Opening an annual summit of Eastern and Central European nations and China, Li Keqiang said "we intend to fully respect European standards."
Beijing has also been criticized for failing to give reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
He adds "we welcome openness and we want to treat all companies that operate in China equally and to increase imports from the (European) countries."
EU member Croatia is hosting a two-day summit between China and 16 regional countries on expanding business between China and the region, dubbed 16+1.


The theatre has a new artistic director.
The Donmar Warehouse has announced a new season of plays, including one entitled Europe.
The play was penned 25 years ago but is billed as “prophetic in its vision of Europe today”.
Written by David Greig, it explores a “powder keg of tensions”, “identity” and “connectiveness” and is described as “a play truly for our times”.
Donmar Warehouse artistic director Michael Longhurst (Helen Maybanks)
A “complex vision of Europe, it looks at “the movement of people, capital and borders” and “explores our complex relationship” to the continent.
The production was announced by Michael Longhurst, in his first season as artistic director of the London theatre.
Longhurst, who will be directing the production when it opens In June, took over from Josie Rourke in the role.
Other productions include Blank, a new play by Alice Birch, on “what happens when a woman goes to prison”.
Co-produced with Clean Break, who work with women with experience of the criminal justice system, it will feature an all-female cast of 15.
The season will also feature Appropriate, a “riotously funny” tale of “family dysfunction” set on a former plantation, Teenage Dick, US playwright Mike Lew’s “high school take on Shakespeare’s Richard III” and Caryl Churchill’s Far Away.
The 251-seat Donmar Warehouse also announced a scheme, to reach new audiences, with 40 additional tickets released for sale every morning for a performance seven days later.

First satellite in European SpaceDataHighway forges 20,000 successful laser links
The European Data Relay System (EDRS)\xe2\x80\x94dubbed the \xe2\x80\x9cSpaceDataHighway\xe2\x80\x9d by its private operator, Airbus\xe2\x80\x94has passed another milestone.
EDRS-A, the first satellite in what will eventually be a global constellation, has made its 20,000th successful optical link to its customer satellites since its launch in January 2016, marking a world first in laser communication in space.
This milestone provides further evidence that ESA\xe2\x80\x99s Partnership Projects initiative successfully develop sustainable end-to-end systems, right up to in-orbit validation.
The system is a public-private partnership between ESA and Airbus, with significant investment by the German Space Administration DLR.
Satellites that are used to monitor the Earth operate from low-Earth orbits and usually relay the information they have acquired only when they are in a direct line-of-sight with a ground antenna.
EDRS-A rides much higher in the sky, where it can maintain a continuous connection with its ground stations and an almost permanent one with the low-Earth orbiting satellites. The system uses secure laser communication to receive data from the low-Earth orbiting satellites and beams the information back to Earth via radio frequency.
\xe2\x80\x9cEarth observation satellites have orbits that mean having to wait up to 100 minutes to transmit information to the ground. That can be a problem when you need information immediately, for example, when trying to provide aid during flooding or wild fires, or help ships navigating through ice sheets,\xe2\x80\x9d says Michael Witting, EDRS project manager at the European Space Agency.
\xe2\x80\x9cEDRS provides data to the ground rapidly because of its bird\xe2\x80\x99s eye view from its geostationary orbit. Its point-to-point transmission using cutting-edge laser communication technology means data can be transmitted at very high speeds, and it is hard to jam the signal or to eavesdrop on it. EDRS is another example of how ESA\xe2\x80\x99s Partnership Projects federate industry around large-scale programmes, achieving a competitive leap forward and economic impact.\xe2\x80\x9d


Europe\xe2\x80\x99s institutions consider Ariane 6 and Vega-C
Support for European institutional customers \t\t\t
\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t
\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t
\t\t\t\t\t\t\t
\t\t\t
ESA and Arianespace are giving full support to European institutional customers to launch their missions on Ariane 6 and Vega-C.
Daniel Neuenschwander, ESA\xe2\x80\x99s Director of Space Transportation and St\xc3\xa9phane Isra\xc3\xabl, CEO at Arianespace welcomed about 100 attendees to a conference last week on Ariane 6 and Vega-C at ESA-ESTEC in Noordwijk, the Netherlands.
In-depth information on the status of development of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s next-generation launchers, and answers to mission specific technical questions, led to productive two-way discussions and follow-up splinter sessions.
Ariane 6 and Vega-C, which will debut next year, will see their activities strongly boosted by institutional missions during the transition phase of 2020\xe2\x80\x932023.
Ariane 6\xe2\x80\x99s maiden flight has already been earmarked for the launch of OneWeb\xe2\x80\x99s constellation satellites, and Vega-C for the launch of LARES. Three European institutional contracts have already been signed for Ariane 6 and Vega-C launch services, with others expected in the coming months.


European quantum communications network takes shape
Today\xe2\x80\x99s interconnected world is ever more vulnerable to cyberattacks, emphasising the importance of secure encryption to protect Europe\xe2\x80\x99s critical infrastructure and communications. An agreement forged today between the European Commission and the European Space Agency marks the first steps towards creating a highly secure, pan-European quantum communication infrastructure.
The development of terrestrial components of the quantum communication infrastructure will be under the responsibility of the EC\xe2\x80\x99s Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG Connect).
It would comprise a series of quantum communication networks, linking institutional users and their critical infrastructures, and sensitive communication and data sites in Europe.
The space-based component, known as SAGA (Security And cryptoGrAphic mission), would be developed under ESA\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility and consists of satellite quantum communication systems with pan-European reach.


ESA oversees teaching of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s next top solderers
Satellites are among the most complex machines ever designed, but in key respects they are still hand-made. A set of ESA-approved training schools train and certify the best solderers in Europe, to ensure they have sufficient ability to work on electronic hardware for space missions.
More than a thousand operators and inspectors take the courses annually. The resulting highly-skilled personnel are often in high demand from terrestrial industry too \xe2\x80\x93 including in the past companies such as Ferrari and the McLaren Formula 1 team. Schools have also been run for customers beyond Europe, from Argentina to Malaysia, as well as the United States.
Soldering class
\t
\xe2\x80\x9cRecognition of ESA accreditation overseas and beyond the boundaries of the space sector is a mark of the training quality being provided,\xe2\x80\x9d comments Mikko Nikulainen, heading ESA\xe2\x80\x99s Components & Materials\xe2\x80\x99 Physics and Chemistry Evaluation and Standardisation Division.
Soldering is an essential skill to assemble devices onto printed circuit boards (PCBs). A single satellite might carry high numbers of these PCBs, and all of them have to go on functioning as planned throughout many years in space.
Just as with everyday electronic devices, PCBs are the source of their host machine\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities and intelligence \xe2\x80\x93 with the crucial difference that for satellite electronics, failure is not an option.
\xe2\x80\x9cIf your mobile phone fails, you change it,\xe2\x80\x9d explains ESA materials and processes engineer Carole Villette. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a satellite stops working in space, representing a massive investment with no chance of repair, then the cost is much, much higher.\xe2\x80\x9d
Test board
\t
There are seven ESA-certified soldering schools across our continent, operated on a commercial basis to serve regional industry, based in Italy, France, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland and the UK (with an additional soldering school in Poland being certified). Solder operators are trained together with inspectors and also instructors, being certified to train other people in turn.
Soldering for space has some important differences from its everyday equivalent, explains soldering instructor Brett Smith of ASTA Technology, part of Portsmouth University in the UK: \xe2\x80\x9cIt takes place inside an environmentally controlled cleanroom \xe2\x80\x93 the particle count permitted within it depends on the sensitivity of the products being assembled.
\xe2\x80\x9cYou wear an electrostatic discharge bracelet and other \xe2\x80\x98ESD\xe2\x80\x99 safe clothing, gloves, hair nets and in some cases beard guards \xe2\x80\x93 preventing static and debris from your own body doing damage or contaminating the equipment.
PCBs are at the heart of spacecraft
\t
\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re looking through a microscope of between four to 40 times magnification depending on the application. The soldering precision required is to an extremely high level.\xe2\x80\x9d
Work benches are kept as clear as possible, to minimise the risk of anything damaging the PCBs or assemblies. Paper instructions are not to be used around flight hardware, as microscopic fibres might contaminate the delicate assemblies.
During their courses, pupils undergo exams, soldering test boards or assemblies which are then self-inspected and verified by the instructor. Solderers, inspectors and trainers receive certifications that have to be renewed every two years, while receiving regular training from their own companies in the meantime.
Printed circuit board for space
\t
The syllabus is based on the European Coordination for Space Standardization \xe2\x80\x93 the definitive set of standards defining how to manage, design, manufacture and verify a European space mission.
\xe2\x80\x9cGetting an understanding of how the terrestrial environment, launch factors and the space environment affect every aspect of flight hardware and how it has to function is an important aspect of the course,\xe2\x80\x9d adds Brett.
\xe2\x80\x9cSolderers and inspectors need that knowledge to be able to understand why the standards are as they are, then use this knowledge to implement the requirements of these standards into their work. This requires both a high level of practical skills as well as a deep knowledge of the ECSS standards to produce reliable products built in the correct environment that will fulfill the required tasks for the full lifetime of the mission.
Microscopes are essential
\t
\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a different scenario from mass-produced terrestrial PCBs, where a badly soldered board or an assembly that does not function as it should can just be thrown away. A single custom-made PCB might be worth tens of thousands of Euros and maybe have taken a year to make, so the onus is on operators and inspectors to modify the assembly \xe2\x80\x93 bearing in mind at the same time that too much reworking can also reduce an assembly\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime reliability.\xe2\x80\x9d
Thomas Rohr, heading ESA\xe2\x80\x99s Materials and Processes section, comments: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy does the space sector need such rigorous standards, more exacting even than terrestrial aviation? The answer is that the space environment is far more challenging than anything else.
\xe2\x80\x9cThere is the violent vibration of launch, mechanical shock of launcher separation followed by the weightlessness, vacuum and temperature extremes of Earth orbit \xe2\x80\x93 space is a place where it is possible to be hot and cold at the same time. Plus there is the dimension of time: our missions must go on operating reliably for years on end. We have to engineer accordingly.\xe2\x80\x9d
Microscopic view of cracked solder joint
\t
Automated soldering has become the norm in many parts of the electronics industry. ESA too favours machine-based soldering if its quality is high enough, because of its inherent repeatability.
But in many cases the production runs are too low to make automated soldering practical, or human soldering is still required to tweak the precision or perform fixes \xe2\x80\x93 the human hand and eye are still superior to machinery.
How we make a space mission
ESA is the space agency for Europe, enabling its 22 Member States to achieve results that no individual nation can match. ESA combines space mission development with supporting labs, test and operational facilities plus in-house experts covering every aspect of space, supported through the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s Basic Activities.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."

MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
Navalny, a leading opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed Tuesday\'s ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled Tuesday that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict.

BERLIN (AP) — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.


European researchers to drill for ancient Antarctic ice
BERLIN (AP) — A group of 14 European scientific institutions plan to retrieve the world\'s oldest ice as part of research into past climate change.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
The consortium led by the Germany-based Alfred Wegener Institute said Tuesday it has identified an area in Antarctica, nicknamed "Little Dome C," that should harbor ice as old as 1.5 million years.
So-called ice core measurements are crucial for scientists\' understanding of past climatic changes on Earth and the models they use to predict future global warming or cooling.
Current ice core measurements provide reliable data going back only about 800,000 years.
At a meeting in Vienna, the institutes said they spent the past three years working with American, Australian, Japanese and Russian colleagues using radar to determine the best possible site for drilling.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has kept its policy promises, interest rates and stimulus settings unchanged as officials weigh looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a news conference Thursday, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more monetary stimulus in coming months. Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for an interest rate increase from the end of the year into next year.

DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) — China\'s prime minister has promised that Beijing will respect European standards and fair trade, seeking to allay concerns that it\'s flouting EU competition rules with huge investments on the continent.
Opening an annual summit of Eastern and Central European nations and China, Li Keqiang said "we intend to fully respect European standards."
Beijing has also been criticized for failing to give reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
He adds "we welcome openness and we want to treat all companies that operate in China equally and to increase imports from the (European) countries."
EU member Croatia is hosting a two-day summit between China and 16 regional countries on expanding business between China and the region, dubbed 16+1.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members — or those hoping to join — could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.
Of the 16 participating countries — Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia — 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A new professional league for elite swimmers will debut this year with U.S. and foreign teams competing in a mixed gender format with the athletes being paid.
Five-time Olympic champion Katie Ledecky will compete for one of the International Swimming League\'s eight teams — four based in the U.S. and four in Europe.
Ledecky said the league "represents a new era for professional swimming."
"Especially for competitive women like me," she said Tuesday. "Jumping in the pool for the ISL really means a new era for women since it\'s one of the first leagues to emphasize gender equality as one of its values."
Besides Ledecky, fellow Americans Nathan Adrian, Simone Manuel and Ryan Murphy have been tabbed as ambassadors. They\'re expected to both compete and help promote the inaugural season.
The ISL won\'t begin until after this summer\'s world championships in South Korea, while a planned 2020 season would start after the Tokyo Olympics.
Sports Videos
Founded by Ukrainian financier Konstantin Grigorishin, the league will launch Oct. 4-5, with meets held nearly every weekend through Nov. 24. The league championship will be in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay in a temporary pool on Dec. 20-21. The racing will be in short-course meters rather than the long-course format used in the Olympics.
"The show that is going to go around it will be quite a production, very fan-oriented," former Olympic medalist Kaitlin Sandeno said.
The U.S. will be represented by: the New York Breakers, the Los Angeles Current, the DC Trident, and the Cali Condors based in San Francisco.
The Breakers will be overseen by general manager Tina Andrew, mother and manager of swimmer Michael Andrew. The Current will be led by retired Olympic backstroke champion Lenny Krayzelburg, the Condors by retired four-time Olympic champion Jason Lezak, and the Trident by Sandeno.
The European teams will be based in London, Rome, Budapest and likely France.
Full rosters will be announced in the coming weeks.
Swimmers will compete for team points in various styles of races, with 12 men and 12 women on each team. The ISL said numerous Olympic champions and world record holders will participate.
"There\'s something about competing for a team title," five-time Olympic champion Adrian said. "It\'s a different kind of energy than what swimmers are used to."
The ISL will have a zero tolerance doping policy and won\'t allow any swimmer with a previous doping violation to participate.
Swimmers will sign two contracts: one with their team and another with the ISL. Revenue will flow from the clubs and the league to the athletes. Grigorishin said revenue will be split 50-50 between the league and swimmers.
"We have one of the hardest working athletes in the sports world and they deserve more than we have gotten so far," Krayzelburg said. "It\'s going to change the landscape, create more exposure and opportunities for our athletes and put the sport of swimming on the forefront, not just in the Olympic year."
Currently, professional swimmers have the TYR Pro Swim Series in the U.S. and the FINA World Cup between August and November in Europe, Asia and the Middle East in which they compete for prize money.
The ISL has overcome roadblocks to its formation, having filed a federal antitrust lawsuit last year against FINA, the sport\'s international governing body.
FINA announced its own Champions Swim Series made up of invitation-only meets in Guangzhou, Budapest and Indianapolis in April and May. Total prize money is $3.9 million and the competitions will include some of the sport\'s biggest names.
"We have no principle conflict with FINA," Grigorishin said. "FINA should be responsible for the whole swimming world. The league is just for the elite swimmers. Somebody has to regulate and set up the rules in swimming. If you are a regulator, you should not be organizer of competition. In the future, FINA will have to make a choice."
Grigorishin said negotiations with global broadcasting outlets are ongoing.


European court: Russia\'s house arrest of Navalny unlawful
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights ruled Tuesday that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
Navalny, a prominent opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed the ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities. It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 20,000 euros ($22,550) in damages.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict to the court\'s highest chamber.
It\'s the second time that the court has ruled against Russia in a matter of months. Last November, the court\'s highest chamber found that Russian authorities violated multiple human rights in detaining Navalny seven times from 2012 to 2014, and that two of the arrests were expressly aimed at "suppressing political pluralism."
It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 63,000 euros in damages, and called on Russia to fix legislation to "take due regard of the fundamental importance of the right to peaceful assembly."
Russia is obliged to carry out the court\'s rulings, which enforce the European Convention on Human Rights, but it has delayed implementing past rulings from the court and argued against them as encroaching on Russian judicial sovereignty.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has left its policy promises and interest rates unchanged as it weighs looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
The ECB has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve in pausing the withdrawal of stimulus measures deployed over a decade to bounce back from the global financial crisis, as central bankers around the world ponder which way the economy is headed. The Fed has already started raising rates but has backed off plans for further rate increases in 2019.
The ECB\'s 25-member governing council was content to stand pat on Thursday, making no changes to its short policy statement. The bank took several steps to support the economy on March 7. Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.
The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4%, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year — if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3% for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8% from a peak of 12.1% in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3% from 3.5%.
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.


Speaking to German newspaper Handelsblatt, China\xe2\x80\x99s Prime Minister Li Keqiang, who is in Brussels to attend the 21st joint EU-China summit, said that the geographical distance cannot keep the EU and China separated.
Keqiang also expressed the readiness of his country is to cooperate with Europe, as its second biggest trade partner, to resolve differences on issues such as Paris climate change agreement, promoting sustainable development, preserving and remaining committed to Iran nuclear deal known as the JCPOA, as well as the fight against terrorism.
KI/IRN83269573


In response to an anti-Iranian statement of G7 ministerial meeting, Ghasemi said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Islamic Republic of Iran evaluates the final paragraphs of this statement as unconstructive and totally unilateral and also considers it clearly contradictory to JCPOA and commitments of its European signatories.
The statement is based on false allegations and misrepresentations of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s peaceful nuclear program and also of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s missile program and regional role, he stressed.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has complied with its international commitments and has shown goodwill in its dialogue with the international community, he said, adding that futile efforts to introduce Iran as a threat will not affect the nation\xe2\x80\x99s determination to pursue its national interests in the region and in the world.
Ghasemi regretted that G7 members are being influenced by bullying behavior of Washington are just after satisfying the United States which is only one member of the body.
He condemned the violation of JCPOA by the three European signatories and demanded their clear explanation about this issue, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cIran will pursue this issue using mechanisms available in JCPOA.\xe2\x80\x9d
In their statement, G7 members claimed that Iran is carrying out \xe2\x80\x9cdestabilizing activities in the region, including its continuing support for terrorist organizations and armed militias.\xe2\x80\x9d It also voices concern about Iran missile program while Tehran has repeatedly announced that missiles are just a mean for deterrence and not a threat to other states.
MAH/4583838


Zarif said that the Islamic Republic will continue pressuring them to honor the historic pact, stressing that the European parties to the deal should shoulder their commitments and could not go on with a few unperformed plans.
The top diplomat made the remarks in an interview with Khamenei.ir on Wednesday.
\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the beginning, the Europeans viewed the JCPOA as an achievement, Zarif said, adding that, however, they might not be prepared, and surely lack enough power to resist the US sanctions.\xe2\x80\x9d
Noting that the European parties have made some insufficient effort regarding the deal, the official said, \xe2\x80\x9cIn some instances, we can even say these efforts show the unpreparedness of the Europeans for working on an area which they claim has strategic importance for them.\xe2\x80\x9d
He said this was exactly the fact that Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei had pointed out when the US left the JCPOA last May.
\xe2\x80\x9cAs it was necessary for us to obligate Europeans to abide by their commitments, we continued to work with the Europeans in the diplomatic dimension, and we will continue to do so; however, we have never placed our hope on Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d
The foreign minister went on to say that \xe2\x80\x9cthis is why in recent years even at the beginning of the JCPOA, most of our relations\xe2\x80\x94the president\xe2\x80\x99s and my visits\xe2\x80\x94have been with neighboring countries, with the countries that were old partners of Iran; like Russia, China, Turkey, Iraq, and we have focused on these regions for our future foreign relations, too.\xe2\x80\x9d
So, the government has been focusing on the countries that are close to us and have sided with us, he said, adding that \xe2\x80\x9cif I want to avoid the term \xe2\x80\x98friend\xe2\x80\x99, I\xe2\x80\x99d say they have been cooperative with us.\xe2\x80\x9d
MNA/Khamenei.ir


The Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif shared a video footage of the 2016 US presidential elections on his Twitter page in which the US incumbent president Donald Trump confessed to Iran\'s role in destroying the ISIL terrorist group. Zarif noted in his tweet, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen [the US president] Donald Trump insisted that Iran is killing ISIS, exactly who did he think was doing the fighting and making the sacrifice?\xe2\x80\x9d
The top Iranian diplomat went on to add \xe2\x80\x9cISIS would\'ve held two Arab capitals and fielded a terrorist Army on Europe\'s doorstep had the IRGC not fought alongside [the] brave peoples of Iraq and Syria.\xe2\x80\x9d
During a telephone conversation, the Iranian president reminded his French counterpart on Tuesday evening that \xe2\x80\x9chad not been for IRGC, the ISIL would now be running at least two countries in the region.\xe2\x80\x9d
The US terrorist designation of IRGC has sparked wide condemnation in Iran, and a number of other countries. Iranian Supreme National Security Council, in retaliation, has recognized the US Central Command (CENCTOM) as a terrorist organization.

European researchers to drill for ancient Antarctic ice
BERLIN (AP) — A group of 14 European scientific institutions plan to retrieve the world\'s oldest ice as part of research into past climate change.
The consortium led by the Germany-based Alfred Wegener Institute said Tuesday it has identified an area in Antarctica, nicknamed "Little Dome C," that should harbor ice as old as 1.5 million years.
So-called ice core measurements are crucial for scientists\' understanding of past climatic changes on Earth and the models they use to predict future global warming or cooling.
Current ice core measurements provide reliable data going back only about 800,000 years.
At a meeting in Vienna, the institutes said they spent the past three years working with American, Australian, Japanese and Russian colleagues using radar to determine the best possible site for drilling.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members — or those hoping to join — could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.
Of the 16 participating countries — Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia — 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

BERLIN (AP) — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has left its policy promises and interest rates unchanged as it weighs looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
The ECB has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve in pausing the withdrawal of stimulus measures deployed over a decade to bounce back from the global financial crisis, as central bankers around the world ponder which way the economy is headed. The Fed has already started raising rates but has backed off plans for further rate increases in 2019.
The ECB\'s 25-member governing council was content to stand pat on Thursday, making no changes to its short policy statement. The bank took several steps to support the economy on March 7. Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.
The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4%, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year — if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3% for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8% from a peak of 12.1% in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3% from 3.5%.
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A new professional league for elite swimmers will debut this year with U.S. and foreign teams competing in a mixed gender format with the athletes being paid.
Five-time Olympic champion Katie Ledecky will compete for one of the International Swimming League\'s eight teams — four based in the U.S. and four in Europe.
Ledecky said the league "represents a new era for professional swimming."
"Especially for competitive women like me," she said Tuesday. "Jumping in the pool for the ISL really means a new era for women since it\'s one of the first leagues to emphasize gender equality as one of its values."
Besides Ledecky, fellow Americans Nathan Adrian, Simone Manuel and Ryan Murphy have been tabbed as ambassadors. They\'re expected to both compete and help promote the inaugural season.
The ISL won\'t begin until after this summer\'s world championships in South Korea, while a planned 2020 season would start after the Tokyo Olympics.
Founded by Ukrainian financier Konstantin Grigorishin, the league will launch Oct. 4-5, with meets held nearly every weekend through Nov. 24. The league championship will be in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay in a temporary pool on Dec. 20-21. The racing will be in short-course meters rather than the long-course format used in the Olympics.
"The show that is going to go around it will be quite a production, very fan-oriented," former Olympic medalist Kaitlin Sandeno said.
The U.S. will be represented by: the New York Breakers, the Los Angeles Current, the DC Trident, and the Cali Condors based in San Francisco.
The Breakers will be overseen by general manager Tina Andrew, mother and manager of swimmer Michael Andrew. The Current will be led by retired Olympic backstroke champion Lenny Krayzelburg, the Condors by retired four-time Olympic champion Jason Lezak, and the Trident by Sandeno.
The European teams will be based in London, Rome, Budapest and likely France.
Full rosters will be announced in the coming weeks.
Swimmers will compete for team points in various styles of races, with 12 men and 12 women on each team. The ISL said numerous Olympic champions and world record holders will participate.
"There\'s something about competing for a team title," five-time Olympic champion Adrian said. "It\'s a different kind of energy than what swimmers are used to."
The ISL will have a zero tolerance doping policy and won\'t allow any swimmer with a previous doping violation to participate.
Swimmers will sign two contracts: one with their team and another with the ISL. Revenue will flow from the clubs and the league to the athletes. Grigorishin said revenue will be split 50-50 between the league and swimmers.
"We have one of the hardest working athletes in the sports world and they deserve more than we have gotten so far," Krayzelburg said. "It\'s going to change the landscape, create more exposure and opportunities for our athletes and put the sport of swimming on the forefront, not just in the Olympic year."
Currently, professional swimmers have the TYR Pro Swim Series in the U.S. and the FINA World Cup between August and November in Europe, Asia and the Middle East in which they compete for prize money.
The ISL has overcome roadblocks to its formation, having filed a federal antitrust lawsuit last year against FINA, the sport\'s international governing body.
FINA announced its own Champions Swim Series made up of invitation-only meets in Guangzhou, Budapest and Indianapolis in April and May. Total prize money is $3.9 million and the competitions will include some of the sport\'s biggest names.
"We have no principle conflict with FINA," Grigorishin said. "FINA should be responsible for the whole swimming world. The league is just for the elite swimmers. Somebody has to regulate and set up the rules in swimming. If you are a regulator, you should not be organizer of competition. In the future, FINA will have to make a choice."
Grigorishin said negotiations with global broadcasting outlets are ongoing.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.

European court: Russia\'s house arrest of Navalny unlawful
MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights ruled Tuesday that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
Navalny, a prominent opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed the ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities. It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 20,000 euros ($22,550) in damages.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict to the court\'s highest chamber.
It\'s the second time that the court has ruled against Russia in a matter of months. Last November, the court\'s highest chamber found that Russian authorities violated multiple human rights in detaining Navalny seven times from 2012 to 2014, and that two of the arrests were expressly aimed at "suppressing political pluralism."
It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 63,000 euros in damages, and called on Russia to fix legislation to "take due regard of the fundamental importance of the right to peaceful assembly."
Russia is obliged to carry out the court\'s rulings, which enforce the European Convention on Human Rights, but it has delayed implementing past rulings from the court and argued against them as encroaching on Russian judicial sovereignty.

The European Central Bank has kept its policy promises, interest rates and stimulus settings unchanged as officials weigh looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a news conference Thursday, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more monetary stimulus in coming months. Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for an interest rate increase from the end of the year into next year.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members — or those hoping to join — could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.
Of the 16 participating countries — Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia — 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

BERLIN (AP) — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.


European researchers to drill for ancient Antarctic ice
BERLIN (AP) — A group of 14 European scientific institutions plan to retrieve the world\'s oldest ice as part of research into past climate change.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
The consortium led by the Germany-based Alfred Wegener Institute said Tuesday it has identified an area in Antarctica, nicknamed "Little Dome C," that should harbor ice as old as 1.5 million years.
So-called ice core measurements are crucial for scientists\' understanding of past climatic changes on Earth and the models they use to predict future global warming or cooling.
Current ice core measurements provide reliable data going back only about 800,000 years.
At a meeting in Vienna, the institutes said they spent the past three years working with American, Australian, Japanese and Russian colleagues using radar to determine the best possible site for drilling.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has left its policy promises and interest rates unchanged as it weighs looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
The ECB has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve in pausing the withdrawal of stimulus measures deployed over a decade to bounce back from the global financial crisis, as central bankers around the world ponder which way the economy is headed. The Fed has already started raising rates but has backed off plans for further rate increases in 2019.
The ECB\'s 25-member governing council was content to stand pat on Thursday, making no changes to its short policy statement. The bank took several steps to support the economy on March 7. Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.
The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4%, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year — if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3% for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8% from a peak of 12.1% in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3% from 3.5%.
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.

2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.

European court: Russia\'s house arrest of Navalny unlawful
MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights ruled Tuesday that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
Navalny, a prominent opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed the ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities. It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 20,000 euros ($22,550) in damages.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict to the court\'s highest chamber.
It\'s the second time that the court has ruled against Russia in a matter of months. Last November, the court\'s highest chamber found that Russian authorities violated multiple human rights in detaining Navalny seven times from 2012 to 2014, and that two of the arrests were expressly aimed at "suppressing political pluralism."
It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 63,000 euros in damages, and called on Russia to fix legislation to "take due regard of the fundamental importance of the right to peaceful assembly."
Russia is obliged to carry out the court\'s rulings, which enforce the European Convention on Human Rights, but it has delayed implementing past rulings from the court and argued against them as encroaching on Russian judicial sovereignty.

DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) — China\'s prime minister promised Friday that his government will respect European standards and fair trade, seeking to allay concerns that it is flouting European Union competition rules with huge investments on the continent.
Opening an annual summit between Eastern and Central European nations and China, Li Keqiang said "we intend to fully respect European standards."
The Chinese government has also been criticized for failing to give reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
"We welcome openness and we want to treat all companies that operate in China equally and to increase imports from the (European) countries," he said. "China is open to the world...we welcome the two-way openness."
EU member Croatia is hosting a two-day summit between China and 16 regional countries on expanding business between China and the region, dubbed 16+1.
Several Eastern European countries are part of China\'s ambitious "Belt and Road" investment and construction project that aims to create a gateway to western European markets. The project includes upgrading infrastructure to create a network of transport and trade links between Asia and Europe.
Beijing has created a $3-billion fund and announced a $10-billion credit line for the 16 countries in the region.
At the start of the plenary meeting, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said that over a relatively short time, the initiative "has resulted in the establishment of new ties and projects" also becoming a platform for "intense and substantial political dialogue" between the participating states.
He also announced that Greece will join the coalition. The vision is to have the Chinese-controlled Greek port of Piraeus become an entry point for Chinese goods to Europe by linking it to railroads and highways that are also part of China\'s investments.

BERLIN (AP) — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members — or those hoping to join — could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.
Of the 16 participating countries — Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia — 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

\xce\x95uropean Commissioner for monetary and economic affairs Olli Rehn warned of the "dramatic repercussions" that will arise in the event of Greece\'s exit from the eurozone and expressed his full disagreement.
"I want to say a few words to those who maintain that the best for Greece is to exit the eurozone" Rehn stressed in a brief statement during a debate on the economic crisis in Europe and safeguarding the euro currency held at the Europarliament plenary on Wednesday in Strasbourg.
"I totally disagree with such a possibility. Whatever way one looks at it, a default on payments and Greece\'s exit from the eurozone would have dramatic repercussions not only for Greece but for all the eurozone member countries," said Rehn.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A new professional league for elite swimmers will debut this year with U.S. and foreign teams competing in a mixed gender format with the athletes being paid.
Five-time Olympic champion Katie Ledecky will compete for one of the International Swimming League\'s eight teams — four based in the U.S. and four in Europe.
Ledecky said the league "represents a new era for professional swimming."
"Especially for competitive women like me," she said Tuesday. "Jumping in the pool for the ISL really means a new era for women since it\'s one of the first leagues to emphasize gender equality as one of its values."
Besides Ledecky, fellow Americans Nathan Adrian, Simone Manuel and Ryan Murphy have been tabbed as ambassadors. They\'re expected to both compete and help promote the inaugural season.
The ISL won\'t begin until after this summer\'s world championships in South Korea, while a planned 2020 season would start after the Tokyo Olympics.
Sports Videos
Founded by Ukrainian financier Konstantin Grigorishin, the league will launch Oct. 4-5, with meets held nearly every weekend through Nov. 24. The league championship will be in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay in a temporary pool on Dec. 20-21. The racing will be in short-course meters rather than the long-course format used in the Olympics.
"The show that is going to go around it will be quite a production, very fan-oriented," former Olympic medalist Kaitlin Sandeno said.
The U.S. will be represented by: the New York Breakers, the Los Angeles Current, the DC Trident, and the Cali Condors based in San Francisco.
The Breakers will be overseen by general manager Tina Andrew, mother and manager of swimmer Michael Andrew. The Current will be led by retired Olympic backstroke champion Lenny Krayzelburg, the Condors by retired four-time Olympic champion Jason Lezak, and the Trident by Sandeno.
The European teams will be based in London, Rome, Budapest and likely France.
Full rosters will be announced in the coming weeks.
Swimmers will compete for team points in various styles of races, with 12 men and 12 women on each team. The ISL said numerous Olympic champions and world record holders will participate.
"There\'s something about competing for a team title," five-time Olympic champion Adrian said. "It\'s a different kind of energy than what swimmers are used to."
The ISL will have a zero tolerance doping policy and won\'t allow any swimmer with a previous doping violation to participate.
Swimmers will sign two contracts: one with their team and another with the ISL. Revenue will flow from the clubs and the league to the athletes. Grigorishin said revenue will be split 50-50 between the league and swimmers.
"We have one of the hardest working athletes in the sports world and they deserve more than we have gotten so far," Krayzelburg said. "It\'s going to change the landscape, create more exposure and opportunities for our athletes and put the sport of swimming on the forefront, not just in the Olympic year."
Currently, professional swimmers have the TYR Pro Swim Series in the U.S. and the FINA World Cup between August and November in Europe, Asia and the Middle East in which they compete for prize money.
The ISL has overcome roadblocks to its formation, having filed a federal antitrust lawsuit last year against FINA, the sport\'s international governing body.
FINA announced its own Champions Swim Series made up of invitation-only meets in Guangzhou, Budapest and Indianapolis in April and May. Total prize money is $3.9 million and the competitions will include some of the sport\'s biggest names.
"We have no principle conflict with FINA," Grigorishin said. "FINA should be responsible for the whole swimming world. The league is just for the elite swimmers. Somebody has to regulate and set up the rules in swimming. If you are a regulator, you should not be organizer of competition. In the future, FINA will have to make a choice."
Grigorishin said negotiations with global broadcasting outlets are ongoing.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.

1:50 p.m.
The European Central Bank has kept its policy promises, interest rates and stimulus settings unchanged as officials weigh looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a news conference Thursday, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more monetary stimulus in coming months. Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for an interest rate increase from the end of the year into next year.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has left its policy promises and interest rates unchanged as it weighs looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
The ECB has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve in pausing the withdrawal of stimulus measures deployed over a decade to bounce back from the global financial crisis, as central bankers around the world ponder which way the economy is headed. The Fed has already started raising rates but has backed off plans for further rate increases in 2019.
The ECB\'s 25-member governing council was content to stand pat on Thursday, making no changes to its short policy statement. The bank took several steps to support the economy on March 7. Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.
The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4%, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year — if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3% for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8% from a peak of 12.1% in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3% from 3.5%.
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members — or those hoping to join — could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.
Of the 16 participating countries — Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia — 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

European court: Russia\'s house arrest of Navalny unlawful
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights ruled Tuesday that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
Navalny, a prominent opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed the ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities. It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 20,000 euros ($22,550) in damages.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict to the court\'s highest chamber.
It\'s the second time that the court has ruled against Russia in a matter of months. Last November, the court\'s highest chamber found that Russian authorities violated multiple human rights in detaining Navalny seven times from 2012 to 2014, and that two of the arrests were expressly aimed at "suppressing political pluralism."
It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 63,000 euros in damages, and called on Russia to fix legislation to "take due regard of the fundamental importance of the right to peaceful assembly."
Russia is obliged to carry out the court\'s rulings, which enforce the European Convention on Human Rights, but it has delayed implementing past rulings from the court and argued against them as encroaching on Russian judicial sovereignty.

BERLIN (AP) — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.

European researchers to drill for ancient Antarctic ice
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — A group of 14 European scientific institutions plan to retrieve the world\'s oldest ice as part of research into past climate change.
The consortium led by the Germany-based Alfred Wegener Institute said Tuesday it has identified an area in Antarctica, nicknamed "Little Dome C," that should harbor ice as old as 1.5 million years.
So-called ice core measurements are crucial for scientists\' understanding of past climatic changes on Earth and the models they use to predict future global warming or cooling.
Current ice core measurements provide reliable data going back only about 800,000 years.
At a meeting in Vienna, the institutes said they spent the past three years working with American, Australian, Japanese and Russian colleagues using radar to determine the best possible site for drilling.

SCHRODER EUROPEAN REIT PLC INCREASES LOGISTICS EXPOSURE WITH €17.3 MILLION FRENCH ACQUISITION
Schroder European Real Estate Investment Trust plc (\'SERE\'), the company investing in European growth cities, has completed the acquisition of two logistics warehouses near Rennes, in Brittany, France, for €17.3 million, reflecting a net initial yield of 5.9%.
The acquisition was part funded with a new loan facility totalling €8.6 million, which has been secured against the Rennes property.
Providing 23,852 sqm of institutional quality space across two adjacent buildings, the property is let on a 12 year lease to C-Log, the logistics subsidiary of Groupe Beaumanoir, the international fashion retailer, which has invested significant capex in equipping the building with automated technology.
The property is located at the junction of two major arterial routes and benefits from excellent sea, high speed rail and air connectivity. In line with Schroders\' Winning Cities strategy, Brittany is one of France\'s fastest growing regions in terms of GDP and population growth.
Jeff O\'Dwyer, of Schroder REIM, commented: \'The 12 year lease on this asset to a strong covenant in a fast growing region of France makes this another excellent addition to our already high-quality portfolio of assets. We have now deployed all of the proceeds from last year\'s sale of low yielding retail assets into five warehouse investments, with a blended net income yield of approximately 6.4%, further diversifying the portfolio and increasing its allocation to the high growth industrial and logistics sector.\'
Following this acquisition, the SERE portfolio comprises 13 properties with a value of approximately €240 million and a blended net initial yield of 6.2%. The portfolio\'s sector allocation is 46% office, 27% retail, 19% industrial and 8% mixed use.
Debt facilities
Totalling €8.6 million, the new loan facility has been agreed with Franco-German regional bank SaarLB. It represents a blended loan to value of approximately 50% against the Rennes property.
The loan has a term of 5.0 years and a margin of 1.4% above 3 month Euribor. The Group has acquired an interest rate cap to limit future potential interest costs, with a strike rate of 1.0% p.a.
SERE now has total third party loans of €73.0 million, representing an overall loan to value across the Group of 29% against the gross asset value, at an average weighted interest rate of 1.4%. The average unexpired loan term is 5.5 years.

Proprietary Index uses real estate and economic metrics to \'score\' European cities and identify future hotspots
Key factors underpinning coworking hotspots are closely intertwined with the growth of the digital economy, entrepreneurial activity and requirements for flexibility
Coworking operators and landlords need to urgently rethink think their design and fit out of office space to keep pace with changing tenant requirements
Published Date : 4/2/2019
Amsterdam, Stockholm, Helsinki and Dublin are among the major cities featured in a new research report from Cushman & Wakefield into the coworking and flexible office sectors, which pinpoints future demand and the next likely growth hotspots across Europe.
Coworking\'s rapid expansion in recent years has quickly disrupted global office markets. The report charts the current state of the sector, the emergence of flexible working space across continental Europe and where future growth will occur.
Cushman & Wakefield currently tracks 11 million square metres of coworking space, serviced offices and flexible workspace providing a critical insight into the sector. London is the most active city with the largest total coworking stock (1.1 million sqm) in Europe, accounting for 4.6% of the overall office market. Indeed, London and New York account for 22 percent of all global coworking stock.
However, the report also looks at where the model might expand next across the continent and which cities display the right combination of factors to support the move away from traditional leasing models to coworking.
Cushman & Wakefield\'s EMEA Research & Insight team has for the first time compiled a proprietary European Coworking Hotspot Index of 10 key markets. More than 40 cities were initially analysed and \'scored\' using quantifiable real estate and economic measures which have supported the growth of the flexible working segment covering scale, business environment, people and catalyst factors.
European Coworking Hotspot Index (Source: Cushman & Wakefield Research)
Established office markets such as London and Paris feature prominently at the top but the list also shows that cities such as Stockholm and Dublin score highly and have great future coworking prospects. These factors mean operators and landlords can be more informed as to what offer is most likely to succeed in these cities in the future.
Report author Elisabeth Troni, Cushman & Wakefield\'s Head of EMEA Research & Insight, said: \'Our European Coworking Hotspot Index adds a twist to the traditional office market hierarchy and shows the disruptive potential of this fast-emerging sector. However, coworking growth potential also reveals a wide range of dynamic factors underlying a city\'s office market. In particular, the growth in coworking represents a clear shift in employment towards digital and technology-based sectors and away from traditional financial services.
\'The new growth sectors of the digital economy are more nimble - and comfortable with flexible working practices. This change in tenant preferences for flexible working is shifting the balance of power towards the tenant as the landlord looks to adjust and adapt their strategies in response. With a better understanding of city-level demand drivers for coworking, operators and landlords can be more informed as to which type of workplace offer is most likely to succeed in cities across Europe.
\'Our analysis shows every city is different. We expect demand for coworking to be strong in our featured hotspot markets and would recommend that coworking operators and office landlords and investors alike adopt a proactive strategy to managing their response to these dynamics.\'
The report also states that many other cities across Europe, which fall outside the top 10 of the index, could nonetheless emerge as interesting locations for flexible office solutions. In fact, in many of these cities, strong growth is already seen in the serviced and managed office offer, reflecting demand from more traditional corporate tenants looking for flexible leasing solutions.
Catherine Bai, Senior Research Analyst, EMEA Research & Insight, said: \'The growth of co-working is forcing operators and landlords to rethink how they design and fit out traditional office space to better accommodate changing tenant demand. We believe the most successful coworking strategies will focus on European cities for their distinct factors, and our research is a nod in this recommended direction.\'

Following the best quarterly performance in four years, the pan-European index climbed 0.9 percent at 0922 GMT, with all major sectors higher.
While gains spread across all regional bourses, Germany\'s trade-sensitive DAX outperformed with its 1.3 percent rise, helped by 3 percent jump in auto stocks which were set for their best daily surge since Jan. 4.
Peugeot SA rose about 3 percent while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles gained 1.6 percent on a report that the two companies are exploring a partnership to share investments to build cars in Europe.
European chip stocks were another bright spot after better-than-expected results from Apple-supplier Foxconn Industrial.
Shares in Dialog Semiconductor Plc, Infineon Technologies, Ams AG and Siltronic AG and STMicroelectronics N.V. rose between 3 percent and 5 percent.
The upbeat mood spilled over from Asian markets, after both official and private surveys showed factory activity in China unexpectedly grew for the first time in four months in March.
China\'s economic data comes on the heels of fresh concerns over a slowing world economy that resurfaced last month after the U.S. Federal Reserve abruptly ended its plans for policy tightening this year and signals from the bond market of an imminent recession.
"The economic growth in China will strengthen from here and that is the strongest signal which is driving the markets today," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at TF Global Markets (UK) Ltd in London.
In contrast, markets seemed to shrug off a survey that found factories in the euro zone had their worst month in March for almost six years. Another survey showed Germany\'s Markit\'s Purchasing Managers\' Index (PMI) for manufacturing fell to an 80-month low reading of 44.1.
"The German number is nothing short of a disaster. We are talking of recession territory over here and this is a huge concern for the European Central Bank. But for the markets today, the focus is on China and the optimism around it," Aslam said.
Adding to the buoyant mood, China said over the weekend that it would continue to suspend additional tariffs on U.S. vehicles and auto parts after April 1, the latest sign of optimism as the world\'s two largest economies work out a deal to end their trade dispute.
Swiss logistics group Panalpina jumped 14 percent on bowing to an increased 4.6 billion Swiss francs ($4.6 billion) bid from Danish rival DSV, ending a more than two-month takeover battle designed to build scale in the consolidating transport sector.
EasyJet slipped 7 percent, among the biggest decliners on the STOXX, after the British low-cost airline warned that demand and pricing were suffering from Brexit jitters and a weaker economic outlook.
Ryanair Holdings also shed over 3 percent.
London\'s FTSE 100 and the Dublin bourse, often seen as a barometer for Brexit sentiment, rose 0.7 percent each.
Britain\'s exit from the European Union was in disarray after a third defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May\'s divorce deal left her under pressure from rival factions to leave without a deal, go for an election or forge a much softer divorce.
Parliament will vote on different Brexit options on Monday and then May could try to bring her deal back to a vote in parliament one more time, possibly as early as Tuesday.
Goldman Sachs says the balance of risks around Brexit outcomes is tilted towards a softer, longer departure from the European Union, after a May\'s withdrawal agreement was rejected for a third time.

The suspension will grant Steinhoff time to continue the ongoing restructuring of its business, make further progress with the internal investigations and finalise its 2017 and 2018 financial statements.
VEB/European Investors agreed to the extension because it further supports the stabilisation of the company, which is in the interest of both the current and former shareholders of Steinhoff.
Shareholders and other investors in Steinhoff are advised to exercise caution when
dealing in the securities of the Group.

The regional STOXX 600 index was up 0.2 percent at 0929 GMT after flitting between slight gains and losses, led by advances in Madrid and Frankfurt.
The ECB is widely expected to keep borrowing costs on hold, but investors will be keen to see if the region\'s central bank provides more details on its plans to issue a new round of cheap multi-year loans to banks to support economic growth.
The rate decision is due out at 1145 GMT.
"The economic data out of the Eurozone shows that the growth has become feeble and there is a strong need for more support from the ECB," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at TF Global Markets (UK) Ltd in London.
Investors are also waiting for U.S. inflation data and minutes of the Federal Reserve\'s March policy meeting due later in the day.
Buoying sentiment was the latest data showing Britain\'s economy unexpectedly grew in February, which follows the International Monetary Fund cutting its 2019 global economic growth forecasts for third time in seven months on Tuesday.
European basic resources stocks led gains on STOXX 600 while retail sector was another notable gainer, rising after four sessions of losses.
Tesco boosted the pan-region index after the company posted a better-than-expected full-year operating profit, cementing the recovery of Britain\'s biggest supermarket.
Dunelm Group Plc rose more than 2 percent as the homeware retailer said it expected to top analysts\' forecasts for full-year profit, as surging online demand helped it ride out a tough British retail environment.
Shares of ASOS surged 14 percent after the British online fashion retailer stuck to its full-year guidance for sales, profit margins and capital expenditure despite a plunge in first-half pretax profit.
At the other end of the index, British engine maker Rolls-Royce dipped after agreeing to inspections on some Trent 1000 TEN engines earlier than previously planned, after the re-emergence of issues related to blade deterioration.
Shares in Indivior Plc plunged by about 75 percent after the U.S. Justice Department announced the indictment of the British drugmaker and a subsidiary on charges that they engaged in an illegal scheme to boost prescriptions of the film version of its opioid addiction treatment Suboxone.
Some ex-dividend stocks, including Swedish Match, Sampo, Nokian Tyres, were among the biggest weights on the index.
Britain\'s FTSE was little changed ahead of a summit between British Prime Minister Theresa and the European Union where a Brexit extension until the end of the year or until March 2020 was looking like the most likely outcome, EU diplomats said.
Reckitt Benckiser slid more than 6 percent as the U.S. Department of Justice alleged that the illegal marketing scheme began before Indivior was spun out of the consumer goods group.

The IMF warned that growth could slow further due to trade tensions and a potentially disorderly British exit from the European Union. China, Germany and other major economies might need to take short-term actions to prop up growth, the IMF said.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers the Trump administration is preparing for the possibility of a "hard Brexit."
Asian shares rose to an eight-month high overnight but U.S. and European markets fell after President Donald Trump welcomed the World Trade Organization\'s finding that Europe\'s subsidies to planemaker Airbus had hurt the United States.
Asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4
The U.S. Trade Representative on Monday proposed a range of EU products, from large commercial aircraft and parts to dairy products and wine, to target as retaliation for subsidies given to Airbus.
Equities fell in Europe and on Wall Street, poised to snap an eight-day rally for the S&P 500, after an EU official said the European trade bloc was beginning preparations to retaliate over Boeing subsidies.
Uncertainty over tariffs and trade between the United States and China have dented business confidence and led corporate investment to dry up, said Hank Smith, co-chief investment officer at The Haverford Trust Co in Radnor, Pennsylvania.
"Business investment is now being put on hold because of the uncertainty around tariffs," he said.
A weak U.S.-China trade deal probably is priced into the market, but a very good trade deal is not, Smith said.
"Even if it\'s not so good, it is going to have a positive effect on the economy because it is going to remove an uncertainty," he said.
MSCI\'s all-country world index, a gauge of stock performance in 47 countries, fell 0.37%. The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.47% and the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares fell 0.41%.
Airbus said it saw no legal basis for the U.S. move towards imposing tariffs on its aircraft and warned of deepening trade tensions.
Shares in Airbus fell 1.86% and many of its key suppliers lost between 0.7% and 1.2%. Boeing shares fell 1.5% ahead of its aircraft delivery and order numbers for March.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 207.09 points, or 0.79%, to 26,133.93. The S&P 500 lost 18.79 points, or 0.65%, to 2,876.98 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 38.62 points, or 0.49%, to 7,915.26.
The yen rose as traders favoured the safe-haven currency in the wake of the U.S. proposal for tariffs on European goods.
The dollar index fell 0.04%, with the euro up 0.05% to $1.1265. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.35% versus the greenback at 111.11 per dollar.
U.S. Treasury yields slid, pressured by concerns about the IMF\'s global economic outlook for 2019 as well as a round of headlines on Britain\'s messy departure from the EU.
In Europe, government borrowing costs in southern countries hit fresh lows, pushed down by hopes that this week\'s European Central Bank meeting will reinforce expectations for supportive policy measures in the months ahead.
Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes rose 6/32 in price to push yields down to 2.4953%.
Oil fell from a five-month high above $71 a barrel after Russia signalled a possible easing of a supply-cutting deal with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Brent, the global benchmark, rose to $71.34 a barrel, the highest since November, but later settled down 49 cents at $70.61 per barrel. U.S. crude also hit a November high of $64.79, but settled down 42 cents at $63.98.
Gold rose to its highest in more than a week as the dollar and equities weakened.
U.S. gold futures settled 0.5% higher at $1,308.3 an ounce.

Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK)
(“Takeda”) today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has
accepted a Marketing Authorization Line Extension Application for a
subcutaneous (SC) formulation of the gut-selective biologic vedolizumab
for maintenance therapy in adults with moderately to severely active
ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s disease (CD). Takeda proposes to make
vedolizumab SC available in both pre-filled syringe and pen options.
“This regulatory application marks an important milestone in our
continued commitment to delivering innovative medicines and treatment
modalities that meet the diverse needs of patients living with
ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease across Europe,” said Adam Zaeske,
Head, GI Franchise, Europe and Canada Business Unit, Takeda. “If
approved, a subcutaneous formulation of vedolizumab, together with the
currently available intravenous option, will provide greater choice,
enhancing the patient experience in line with their treatment
preferences and lifestyle.”
The application is based on the pivotal VISIBLE 1 phase 3 study, which
assessed the safety and efficacy of a SC formulation of vedolizumab as
maintenance therapy in 216 adult patients with moderately to severely
active UC who achieved clinical response* at week 6 following two doses
of open-label vedolizumab intravenous (IV) induction therapy at weeks 0
and 2.1 Interim data from other ongoing VISIBLE studies
involving patients with CD were also included in the application. The
results of VISIBLE 1 were presented at the 2018 United European
Gastroenterology (UEG) Week Congress in Vienna, Austria.
In evaluating the primary endpoint of VISIBLE 1, a statistically
significant proportion of patients receiving vedolizumab SC 108 mg
maintenance therapy administered every two weeks achieved clinical
remission** compared to patients receiving placebo (46.2% vs. 14.3%;
p<0.001) at week 52. A similar rate of clinical remission was observed
in the vedolizumab IV 300 mg reference arm (42.6%) at week 52.
Furthermore, adverse event rates, including severe adverse events and
infections, were similar between the SC and IV groups at week 52.
Injection-site reactions were mild and experienced by 10.4% of patients
in the vedolizumab SC treatment arm (vs. 0% in the placebo group), with
none leading to treatment discontinuation.1
* Clinical response is defined as a reduction in complete Mayo score
of ≥3 points and ≥30% from baseline (week 0) with an accompanying
decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 point or absolute rectal
bleeding subscore of ≤1 point2
** Clinical remission is defined as a complete Mayo score of ≤2
points and no individual subscore >1 point2
###
About the VISIBLE clinical trial program
The VISIBLE
clinical trial program aims to assess the efficacy and safety of an
investigational subcutaneous (SC) formulation of vedolizumab as
maintenance therapy in adult patients with moderately to severely active
ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD).
VISIBLE consists of three phase 3 studies involving over 1,000 patients
which includes two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies
examining the percentage of participants achieving clinical remission at
week 52 in UC and CD, respectively, and an open-label extension study to
determine the long-term safety and efficacy of vedolizumab SC consisting
of patients who have completed one of the randomized clinical trials.2,3,4
About Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease
Ulcerative
colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are two of the most common forms
of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).5 Both UC and CD are
chronic, relapsing, remitting, inflammatory conditions of the
gastrointestinal tract that are often progressive in nature.6,7
UC only involves the large intestine as opposed to CD which can affect
any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus.8,9 CD can also
affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall, while UC only involves
the innermost lining of the large intestine.8 UC commonly
presents with symptoms of abdominal discomfort, loose bowel movements,
including blood or pus.8,10 CD commonly presents with
symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.6 The
cause of UC or CD is not fully understood; however, recent research
suggests hereditary, genetics, environmental factors, and/or an abnormal
immune response to microbial antigens in genetically predisposed
individuals can lead to UC or CD. 8,11,12
About Entyvio® (vedolizumab)
Vedolizumab
is a gut-selective biologic and is approved as an intravenous (IV)
formulation.13 It is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed
to specifically antagonize the alpha4beta7 integrin, inhibiting the
binding of alpha4beta7 integrin to intestinal mucosal addressin cell
adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), but not vascular cell adhesion molecule
1 (VCAM-1).14 MAdCAM-1 is preferentially expressed on blood
vessels and lymph nodes of the gastrointestinal tract.15 The
alpha4beta7 integrin is expressed on a subset of circulating white blood
cells.14 These cells have been shown to play a role in
mediating the inflammatory process in ulcerative colitis (UC) and
Crohn’s disease (CD).14,16,17 By inhibiting alpha4beta7
integrin, vedolizumab may limit the ability of certain white blood cells
to infiltrate gut tissues.14
Vedolizumab IV is approved for the treatment of adult patients with
moderately to severely active UC and CD, who have had an inadequate
response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either
conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.13
Vedolizumab IV has been granted marketing authorization in over 60
countries, including the United States and European Union, with more
than 260,000 patient years of exposure to date.18
Therapeutic Indications (vedolizumab IV)
Ulcerative colitis
Vedolizumab is indicated for the
treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active
ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost
response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.
Crohn’s disease
Vedolizumab is indicated for the
treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s
disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or
were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.
Important Safety Information
Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance
or to any of the excipients.
Special warnings and special precautions for use
Vedolizumab
should be administered by a healthcare professional prepared to manage
hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, if they occur.
Appropriate monitoring and medical support measures should be available
for immediate use when administering vedolizumab. Observe patients
during infusion and until the infusion is complete.
Infusion-related reactions
In clinical studies,
infusion-related reactions (IRR) and hypersensitivity reactions have
been reported, with the majority being mild to moderate in severity. If
a severe IRR, anaphylactic reaction, or other severe reaction occurs,
administration of vedolizumab must be discontinued immediately and
appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines).
If a mild to moderate IRR occurs, the infusion rate can be slowed or
interrupted and appropriate treatment initiated (e.g., epinephrine and
antihistamines). Once the mild or moderate IRR subsides, continue the
infusion. Physicians should consider pre-treatment (e.g., with
antihistamine, hydrocortisone and/or paracetamol) prior to the next
infusion for patients with a history of mild to moderate IRR to
vedolizumab, in order to minimize their risks.
Infections
Vedolizumab is a gut-selective integrin
antagonist with no identified systemic immunosuppressive activity.
Physicians should be aware of the potential increased risk of
opportunistic infections or infections for which the gut is a defensive
barrier. Vedolizumab treatment is not to be initiated in patients with
active, severe infections such as tuberculosis, sepsis, cytomegalovirus,
listeriosis, and opportunistic infections until the infections are
controlled, and physicians should consider withholding treatment in
patients who develop a severe infection while on chronic treatment with
vedolizumab. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of
vedolizumab in patients with a controlled chronic severe infection or a
history of recurring severe infections. Patients should be monitored
closely for infections before, during and after treatment. Before
starting treatment with vedolizumab, screening for tuberculosis may be
considered according to local practice. Some integrin antagonists and
some systemic immunosuppressive agents have been associated with
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a rare and
often fatal opportunistic infection caused by the John Cunningham (JC)
virus. By binding to the α4β7 integrin expressed on gut-homing
lymphocytes, vedolizumab exerts an immunosuppressive effect specific to
the gut. Although no systemic immunosuppressive effect was noted in
healthy subjects, the effects on systemic immune system function in
patients with inflammatory bowel disease are not known. Healthcare
professionals should monitor patients on vedolizumab for any new onset
or worsening of neurological signs and symptoms, and consider
neurological referral if they occur. If PML is suspected, treatment with
vedolizumab must be withheld; if confirmed, treatment must be
permanently discontinued. Typical signs and symptoms associated with PML
are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive
weakness on one side of the body, clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of
vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to
confusion and personality changes. The progression of deficits usually
leads to death or severe disability over weeks or months.
Malignancies
The risk of malignancy is increased in patients
with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Immunomodulatory medicinal
products may increase the risk of malignancy.
Prior and concurrent use of biological products
No
vedolizumab clinical trial data are available for patients previously
treated with natalizumab. No clinical trial data for concomitant use of
vedolizumab with biologic immunosuppressants are available. Therefore,
the use of vedolizumab in such patients is not recommended.
Vaccinations
Prior to initiating treatment with vedolizumab
all patients should be brought up to date with all recommended
immunizations. Patients receiving vedolizumab may receive non-live
vaccines (e.g., subunit or inactivated vaccines) and may receive live
vaccines only if the benefits outweigh the risks.
Adverse reactions include: nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia,
upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, influenza, sinusitis,
cough, oropharyngeal pain, nausea, rash, pruritus, back pain, pain in
extremities, pyrexia, fatigue and anaphylaxis.

The two sides have been locked in a years-long spat over mutual claims of illegal aid to plane giants, Netherlands-based Airbus and U.S.-based Boeing Co, to help them gain advantage in the world jet business.
The case has been grinding its way through the World Trade Organization for almost 15 years and is reaching a climax as both sides approach the final stages of arbitration.
"The World Trade Organization finds that the European Union subsidies to Airbus has adversely impacted the United States, which will now put Tariffs on $11 Billion of EU products!" Trump said on Twitter. "The EU has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade for many years. It will soon stop!"
His comments came a day after the U.S. Trade Representative proposed a list of EU products targeted for tariffs, ranging from large commercial aircraft to dairy products and wine, as retaliation for European aircraft subsidies. The final list is expected this summer.
In response, the European Commission said earlier Tuesday it had started to draw up plans to retaliate over Boeing subsidies.
"The Commission is starting preparations so that the EU can promptly take action based on the arbitrator\'s decision on retaliation rights in this case," a Commission spokesman said. "The European Union remains open for discussions with the United States, provided these are without preconditions and aim at a fair outcome."
Both sides have won partial victories in claiming Airbus and Boeing received unlawful subsidies but disagree on the amount involved and whether each has complied with earlier WTO rulings.
Airbus said it saw no legal basis for the U.S. move and warned of deepening transatlantic trade tensions.
The EU is already facing U.S. tariffs on its steel and aluminum exports and Trump has repeatedly threatened to hit EU cars with punitive duties.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told a conference in Paris that the two sides needed to reach a friendly agreement.
"When I see the situation global growth is in, I don\'t think we can afford to have a trade conflict, even if only on the specific issues of the aircraft industry in the United States and Europe," he said.
\'MORE TIT-FOR-TAT\'
The U.S. tariffs proposal put pressure on shares in European makers of aircraft and aerospace suppliers, wine, cheese and luxury goods.
Airbus fell nearly 2 percent, while Boeing dropped 1.5 percent. Airbus suppliers such as Safran and Leonardo also were down.
Analysts were divided over whether the ramped-up dispute would lead to greater global trade issues.
"Get ready for more tit-for-tat scrapping to follow," said John Woolfitt of London brokerage Atlantic Markets.
Germany is particularly apprehensive of possible U.S. tariffs on car imports. The United States is a major market for Volkswagen, Mercedes maker Daimler and BMW.
Moody\'s said on Tuesday that potential U.S. tariffs on imported autos and parts represented a significant risk to global growth and would hinder economic momentum in Germany, Japan and Korea.
" ... The U.S. wants to pressure the EU to engage in meaningful trade talks, but without having to apply the more painful measure of automotive tariffs,” said Cailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit.
Fabiana Fedeli at Robeco sees the latest moves as tactical.
"The new tariffs ... are a drop in the ocean as a percentage of the overall trade between the U.S. and Europe and we view them as a negotiating tool to set the tone for what the really important negotiations are, namely autos," she said.

The long-awaited brand new B&M store in Bradley was officially opened this morning, much to the joy of local customers.
Over 20 jobs were created at the store, which can be found on Leeds Road Retail Park in Huddersfield.
A wide range of branded products are available to purchase, including toys, food & drink, homeware, pet products, health & beauty and seasonal.
As part of the opening day process, colleagues nominated local charity, Huddersfield Mission, to be given some VIP treatment, and help to open the new store.
The charity has been based in Huddersfield for more than 100 years, they offer advice and support to those struggling with complex needs such as homelessness, mental health, addiction and more.
In addition to helping to open the new store, the charity were given £250 worth of vouchers to spend.
The store manager, Josh Howarth, said: \'The team from Mission Huddersfield really stood out for us as they go the extra mile for local people in the community, so we wanted to give them some VIP treatment as a thank you for all the hard work they do.
\'We hope that our donation can help them to continue the great work they do.\'
He also commented: \'Our new colleagues have been working really hard to get the store ready, and we can\'t wait to show customers their brand new B&M.\'

Terrorism and political activism creating new vulnerabilities for business in Europe
Terrorists are increasingly targeting public spaces and concentrations of people, exposing firms to potentially significant exposures;
11 countries in Europe now have populist parties in government, while populist parties hold on average 22% of vote share across 33 European countries.
London (April 10, 2019) Europe faces an increasingly complex security environment, as Islamist and far-right terrorism creates new vulnerabilities for businesses and communities, according to new research from Aon, the leading global professional services firm providing a broad range of risk, retirement and health solutions.
Aon\'s 2019 Risk Maps, developed in partnership with Continuum Economics and The Risk Advisory Group, examine political risk, terrorism and political violence around the world. This year the picture is complicated further by a resurgence of populist politics, which has encouraged potentially divisive policy shifts and may is some cases fuel extreme ideologies, while challenging Europe\'s rule-based order.
These issues are creating new risks for business, from the security of their employees and property in the face of increasing terrorism risk, to impacts on their supply chains and investments as a result of populist government policies. There is a range of risk management solutions that organisations can use to respond to these challenging conditions.
Scott Bolton, Director, Crisis Management at Aon said: \'Insurance coverage is available to protect business against both the threat and impact of terrorism, but also for more nuanced issues such as denial of access as part of a security operation, loss of attraction following a terrorist attack, or the impact from acts of violence where motives aren\'t immediately apparent; extending cover to include \'malicious\' loss triggers.\'
Sarah Taylor, Head of Political Risk and Structured Credit at Aon, added: \'Businesses operating in territories where political risk is elevated should be considering insurance that covers against government decisions that can lead to contract cancellation, when measures are introduced to create barriers to trade, and against government action that curtails business operations and/or investments.\'
Henry Wilkinson, Head of Intelligence & Analysis at the Risk Advisory Group, said: \'Reactionary populism in the political mainstream in several countries has given extremist fringes a sense of opportunity upon which to mobilise violent protests and intimidation around divisive political themes. Far right terrorism remains a largely disorganised but growing threat. Businesses in Europe cannot be complacent about violent risks in traditionally stable markets. A comprehensive capability to monitor, assess and manage violent risks, is as essential as a violent risk transfer strategy.\'
Key findings include:
Terrorism
Terrorists are increasingly targeting public spaces and concentrations of people, exposing firms to potentially significant exposures.
Germany experienced a spike in far-right attacks and plots - with 23 incidents between 2016-2018, doubling previous numbers - but it is apparent that far-right terrorism and activism is on the rise throughout Europe.
Returning Islamic State fighters will present significant challenges to security services, businesses and communities across Europe.
Islamic State attacks in Europe and North America fell by half between 2017 and 2018, but rather than decline globally, the group has redirected its efforts elsewhere.
16 percent of terrorist attacks in 2018 targeted or directly impacted business.
Populism
Populism is no longer a fringe issue in Europe. 11 countries in Europe now have populist parties in government, while populist parties hold on average 22% of vote share across 33 European countries.
Where populist policies to lead to greater barriers to trade, this has increased the prospect of politically-motivated moves to frustrate established contracts, while forcing firms to consider their international supply chains as tariffs and trade barriers rise.
Anti-immigrant sentiment is one of the central tenets of many populist movements. This is likely to fuel further far-right terrorism and social tension.
Risks are also apparent for European firms operating globally, with regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America particularly exposed to government interventions that can impact firms\' ability to investment and trade internationally.

Following is the text of UN Secretary-General António Guterres\' video message to the high-level conference on \'Sustainable Europe 2030: From Goals to Delivery\', in Brussels today:
I am pleased to greet your timely conference on delivering the goals set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. From rising inequality and intolerance to armed conflict and environmental degradation, our world faces grave challenges.
The worsening impacts of climate change threaten to put at risk any hard-won gains towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In September, I am convening a climate action summit. Along with the SDG Summit and high-level dialogue on financing for development, we can mobilize the ambition we need.
The European Union is a key partner for achieving the 2030 Agenda in Europe and beyond. I know you also share my commitment to engaging and empowering the world\'s young people and advancing gender equality. The United Nations counts on your continued support as we strive to build a peaceful and prosperous future for all.
In that spirit, I wish you fruitful deliberations. Thank you.


Thank you Minister, thank you Eugen. First of all I would like to thank you for the excellent organisation of this informal ECOFIN here in Bucharest.
Indeed, today we discussed the topic of labour mobility. Freedom of movement of people is one of the founding principles of the Single Market and a cornerstone of European integration. It has provided European citizens with great opportunities and helped create a sense of belonging to the Union.
At the same time, labour mobility bears a number of challenges and the study presented by the Centre of European Policy Studies sheds some light on this.
While mobility has overall positive effects, when it is of a long-term nature it also leads to permanent changes in the quantity and possibly the skill composition of the labour force.
Brain drain is a real concern in some countries and large outflows can create skills and labour shortages in a number of sectors. On a larger scale, and depending on the specialisation of a national or regional economy, even a \'hand drain\' of more manual occupations may be a source of concern.
In receiving countries, some perceive EU mobility as a cause of unfair competition and downwards pressure on wages and on the availability and quality of public services. Such perceptions are not always grounded on real evidence, but we need to take these concerns seriously.
Wage levels are an important factor for people to move to another Member State. But it is not the only factor and convergence to reduce east-west migration on this basis is already taking place. But it is also true that it is about convergence of living standards and quality of life in the widest sense.
Reducing disparities and stimulating economic convergence within the European Union remains the main way forward to ensure that we reduce the push factors which are driving migration.
At the national level, this means growth-enhancing investment and structural reforms, policies that ensure efficient, corruption-free institutions and access to high quality public goods and services such as health care, education and life-long learning policies that provide equal opportunities to gain high-quality education and skills relevant for the market and that facilitate upskilling of the domestic labour force, and measures to support fairness and inclusive growth to reduce income inequality to mention just a few policies.
At the European level, European structural and investment funds and the European Fund for Strategic Investment help promote upward convergence.
These EU funds in combination with growth-enhancing structural reforms help create opportunities for brain circulation and the return of migration to originally sending countries.
Ministers also discussed the role of taxation in supporting inclusive and sustainable growth.
Taxation policy is indeed a powerful tool to tackle issues such as income inequality, incentivising innovation or supporting a cleaner environment and improved health.
It is also about tax fairness and the fight against tax avoidance. Billions of euros are lost every year to state budgets due to tax avoidance.
Another issue to stress is that in many EU economies today we have a tax burden which is relatively high on labour. We constantly recommended to countries to shift away the tax burden from labour to other sources less detrimental to growth. In this, we should especially shift away the tax burden from lower paid labour.
Going forward, our view is that the EU needs a shared strategy for future tax policies. We need to factor in the changing environment with fast developing technologies, the digital economy and new forms of work, amongst others.
I would also like to thank Ángel Gurría, Secretary-General of the OECD, for updating Ministers on progress made in finding global solutions to digital taxation.
In this context, the Commission calls on Member States to coordinate their positions and speak with one voice to have more impact and influence in those international negotiations.
This is why the Commission proposed to have a dedicated debate in the May ECOFIN to coordinate our positions ahead of the G20. We will propose specific options for this debate.
The last point on our agenda was preparations for next week\'s G20 and the IMF meetings in Washington.
Brexit is likely to be the most debated topic.
But there are other issues that require our attention. These are continuous trade tensions, the slowdown in the world economy, but also policy preparedness in addressing population aging on the both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Thank you.

04/01/2019
Hanover, 1 April 2019 - Huawei Technologies, one of the world\'s leading ICT equipment providers and technical driver of the new transmission standard for networking devices - narrowband IoT (NB IoT) - has named Q-loud GmbH as European operator of OceanConnect, its IoT device management platform. Representatives of Huawei and Q-loud signed a corresponding agreement at the Hannover Messe trade fair on 1 April. For Q-loud, the IoT subsidiary of QSC AG, this represents a substantial addition to its activities in managing mobile radio connections, such as LTE, NB-IoT or 5G, in combination with its own IoT hub.
Narrowband-IoT is a certified mobile radio standard that specialises in networking devices in the Internet of Things. It is characterised by robust and reliable transmissions, maximum IT security, low electricity consumption and minimal costs. This addition to other mobile radio standards, such as LTE or 5G, is therefore particularly well suited to reliably networking devices operated by long-life batteries or to mass-circulation products.
Q-loud GmbH is enabled for Huawei\'s OceanConnect platform and uses it as a universal NB IoT platform. Permanent monitoring of connectivity, device functionality and status make it possible to detect and remedy any interruptions at an early stage. To guarantee high security standards, Q-loud operates the OceanConnect platform at the QSC AG data centres, which are located in Germany.
\'Given their long track record of telecommunications competence and understanding of the IoT needs of European companies, Q-loud\'s experts have precisely the skills needed to operate an industrial IoT network\', comments Jörg Diederichs, Head of the \'New Business\' division at Huawei Deutschland.
\'This cooperation clearly underlines our outstanding competence as a full-stack IoT provider for the industrial use of NB IoT and 5G\', explains Frank Thelen, Managing Director of Q-loud GmbH. \'The possibilities offered by OceanConnect will enable us to implement an even fuller range of solutions when it comes to connecting devices and central digital data hubs, such as Q-loud\'s IoT hub.\'
One of the first users of narrowband IoT is Munich Airport. To enhance its energy efficiency, in a trial project the airport is currently monitoring electricity meters in less accessible environments. To this end, the data is transmitted to OceanConnect at brief intervals using narrowband IoT. Munich Airport draws on this information to gain a more exact view of its various areas of energy use and to detect potential optimisation measures.

The ECB\'s decision on rates matched investors\' expectations but President Mario Draghi\'s comments shed very little light on reported plans for a tiered deposit rate and a new round of ultra-cheap bank loans.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.3 percent, although sentiment was capped by threats made by the United States earlier this week to slap tariffs on European Union-made goods.
Banks, which were broadly boosted some weeks ago on reports of a planned ECB tiered deposit rate, dropped 0.3 percent as investors failed to get details on this from Draghi.
Commerzbank slid 2.3 percent, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the result of its merger talks with Deutsche Bank was open and after a report Deutsche Bank\'s chief executive told his Commerzbank counterpart that he wants more time to consider a merger.
"European markets were given a lift by the ECB, but the gains were limited thanks to the cautious tone adopted by Mario Draghi," Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, wrote in a note.
"While European stocks have recovered, there is still much to be done to repair the economic strength of the eurozone."
Rate-sensitive real estate stocks raced up 1.8 percent in their best one-day showing since early 2019.
The sector index has a dividend yield of 4.15 percent, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, and each stock on the index ended Wednesday higher.
Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield rose 3.6 percent. It announced a 850 million euro (732.27 million pounds) deal to sell an office building in Paris after markets closed on Tuesday.
Retailers gained for the first time in five sessions, with Tesco up 3.6 percent to lead sector gains after beating full-year operating profit expectations.
European basic resources stocks added 1 percent, with Norsk Hydro rising 1.3 percent. JP Morgan raised its price target on the Oslo-listed aluminium giant, which announced a 150 million Norwegian crown ($17.64 million) facility upgrade on the day.
Higher oil prices aided a 0.7 percent rise in oil and gas stocks.
A 0.4 percent loss among healthcare stocks tempered the broad benchmark\'s gains, with Novartis AG knocked 3 percent lower on the back of price target cuts by UBS, Independent Research and Barclays.
Morgan Stanley also downgraded the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, putting it at "underweight" and cutting its price target. It said the spin-out of Alcon will "shine a spotlight on the challenges from generic erosion facing Novartis\' pharma business"
London-listed Indivior Plc dived 71.6 percent after the U.S. Justice Department announced the indictment of the drugmaker and a unit on charges they engaged in an illegal scheme to boost prescriptions of the film version of its opioid addiction treatment Suboxone.
Reckitt Benckiser Group sought to play down any potential impact to its infant formula business from the indictment of Indivior - which it used to own - saying the risk was theoretical and unlikely. Reckitt\'s shares fell 6.5 percent.
Britain\'s Britain\'s FTSE 100 was little changed. European Union leaders will grant Prime Minister Theresa May a second delay to Brexit at an emergency summit but will argue over how long and on what terms.

Six teams have emerged successful from the 31 March-5 April 2019 Wild Card Hackathon, which saw 35 hopeful entrepreneurs from across Europe convene in Amsterdam to work through a number of tasks designed to encourage teamwork and improve business skills.
A total of 19 participants belong to the EIT Health Wild Card teams that have been selected to continue to the next stage of the programme, which will be held in Paris starting in May. This upcoming Business Model Validation stage will be a ten-week journey of intensive mentoring and customer discovery that participants go through before entering the final pitch contest in July. The two teams winning that pitch contest will share in a total of EUR 4 million in funding and receive further support in bringing their innovative products or solutions to market.
The teams have each chosen to work on one of two challenges:
Digital Biomarkers: Improving early diagnostics with the application of digital biomarkers.
Brain and Mental Health: Improving prediction, diagnosis and treatment to fight mental disorders and strengthen brain health.
\'During the Hackathon, the participants were tested on their team-building qualities as much as their business healthcare innovation proposals,\' EIT Health Director of Innovation Jorge Fernandez Garcia said. \'We have selected teams who have shown real potential to perform well together, in order to identify the specific unmet needs within the Wild Card challenge areas and find feasible, impactful solutions to address them.
The winning teams
The six teams progressing to the next stage following the Hackathon are:
Digital Biomarker challenge:
BioDTek: Enrique Hernandez, Eduard Guerrero, Erika Plata, Francisco Jesus Aloa and Edilberto Ojeda.
Dinosis: Miguel Amador, Jane Bourgninaud and Andreu Oliver.
Phi: Mahmoud Tavakoli and Pedro Lopes.

iLoF: Luis Valente and Joana Paiva.
Panthera: Alfonso Maria Ponsiglione, Clemens Lowik and Kranthi Panth.
Pipra: John Klepper, Nick Gklezakos, Nayeli Schmutz and Benjamin Dodsworth.
Starting in early May, in Paris at the ICM (Brain and Spine Institute), the finalists will work more closely with their mentors to test their hypotheses, validate and develop value propositions, and identify appropriate business models for their proposed solutions to meet the Wild Card healthcare challenges. The mentors will be supporting the teams through a series of sessions looking at key issues in innovation and entrepreneurship, such as intellectual property, de-risking projects and business economics.
Wild Card finalist 2019 Miguel Amador said: \'The week in Amsterdam was a great experience and allowed me to find other like-minded people who are passionate about making a change in healthcare. Our team is delighted to be one of the finalists moving on to the next stage of the Wild Card programme.\'

Stock Exchange Press Release: Infront ASA (\'Infront\' or \'the Company) today entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the shares in vwd Group GmbH (\'VWD\') from a fund managed by The Carlyle Group (Carlyle) to create the leading European financial market solutions provider.
The purchase price is EUR 130 million on an enterprise value basis. The transaction is proposed financed by a bond issue of EUR 105 million and an equity rights issue of approximately NOK 240 million (equivalent to approximately EUR 25 million), both fully underwritten.
VWD provides end-to-end technology and data solutions for the wealth management industry, combining data and feed solutions, publication and distribution systems, portfolio management- and regulatory technology services. The company has a significant market position in the German-speaking region, serving ~2,400 customers with ~50,000 professional users. VWD has approximately 400 employees and 2018 revenue was NOK 654 million, of which 98% was recurring revenue through a SaaS delivery model, and an adjusted EBITDA of NOK 105 million.
\'We are two highly complementary businesses in terms of customers, products and geographical strongholds. Together we will reach an even wider customer base, explore significant cross- and upsell opportunities and capture cost synergies from consolidating data feeds and other efficiencies,\' said Kristian Nesbak, the CEO and co-founder of Infront.
\'When we listed in 2017, it was with the ambition of becoming a top 3 provider of financial terminals in Europe within five years. Now, only 18 months after the IPO, we have delivered on that ambition with the acquisitions of VWD and Market Connect late last year.\'
The combined business will be a leading full-service provider of real-time market information and portfolio management solutions to financial professionals in Europe with ~3,600 diversified customers and ~90,000 professional users. 2018 revenue for the combined company exceeded NOK 1,055 million and adjusted EBITDA was NOK 195 million, including estimated near-term synergies of NOK 25 million.
\'We are delighted to see that Infront will support and accelerate VWD\'s successful strategic development. We would like to thank VWD\'s management team for their trust and cooperation during our successful partnership and wish VWD and Infront continued future success,\' Thorsten Dippel, Managing Director of the Carlyle Europe Technology Partners (CETP) team.
Infront has estimated initial cost savings of NOK 25 million from consolidating data feeds and licenses to be realized through the first 12 months after closing with further cost savings expected over time from operational efficiencies and scaling effects.
\'We expect significant long-term synergies beyond consolidating data feeds and licenses. We are now establishing an efficient platform for organic growth in Europe and globally,\' said Max Hofer, the CFO of Infront.
Financing of the acquisition
Infront proposes to finance the acquisition of VWD through a combination of new equity and a new senior secured bond issue. The purchase price shall be paid in cash upon completion of the transaction.

05 April 2019
After almost two years of discussions, the European Parliament has taken a final position on the social and market related proposals of the Mobility Package, released in May 2017. CLECAT supported the initial objectives of the European Commission, which were to increase enforceability, to enhance focus on fighting illegal practices and to simplify the current rules. Different interpretations of the rules has led in recent years to internal market fragmentation and disproportionate national measures that hamper free movement in the single market.
Commenting on the positions adopted by the European Parliament, Ms Nicolette van der Jagt, Director General of CLECAT, noted: \'It remains to be seen whether the compromise reached on posting in international road transport will be feasible in practice. The patchwork of administrative national individual regulations will not be resolved by this for the time being.\' CLECAT has always called for the exclusion of the Posting of Workers directive to international transport. This will increase the administrative burden in the sector with complex new rules (with different national legislations and minimum wages per Member State depending on the truck, goods transported, age of the driver etc.). Equally, it will be difficult for carriers to underpin the sector\'s CO2 reduction efforts as it will increase empty runs.
Excluding bilateral transport (plus one extra activity of loading and/or unloading in each direction, or zero on the way out and up to two on return) is far from sufficient to guarantee a well-functioning internal market for road transport. The Parliament has recognised that one key element for improving enforcement is having a reliable way to register when and where the truck has crossed a border and to localise loading and unloading activities. However, it still needs to be seen whether the ambitious timelines will be achieved to make this happen with the smart tachograph.
The European Parliament position on cabotage does not come as a surprise as the transport experts in the European Parliament already supported further restrictions of market liberalisation. The existing restriction on the number of cabotage operations (3 operations within 7 days) will be replaced with a 3-day time limit during which the unlimited number of operations will be permitted. Following the end of the above-mentioned 3-day period, there will be a \'cooling-off\' period of 60 hours for vehicles, which must be spent in the country of establishment before the vehicle can start another cabotage operation. Then, vehicles will be obliged to return to the country of residence once every 4 weeks and perform at least one loading or one unloading of goods.
\'One of the objectives of the review of the legislation was to simplify enforcement of cabotage. The Parliament has made current cabotage operations more complex by adding a \'cooling-off\' period even though posting rules already apply as of day 1. It would lead to considerable efficiency losses and capacity gaps in road freight transport. On top of this, the obligation to regularly return the vehicles to the country of establishment will lead to an undesirable increase in empty kilometres and emissions,\' Ms van der Jagt commented.
With regards to new rules on driving and resting times, CLECAT regrets that the driving and resting time rules have been changed without the proposal by MEP Wim van de Camp, which would have allowed sleeping in the cabin for the 45-hour weekly rest, subject to certain conditions of parking areas related to service and security.
The Parliament positions, some of which were adopted with a very narrow majority, correspond in many respects to those of the EU Council of Transport Ministers. This paves way for trilogue negotiations with the Council and the European Commission to bring this important reform package for road freight transport into force and to create a new European regulatory framework. Ms van der Jagt noted that the trilogues will offer the final opportunity for necessary corrections and for more flexibility. However, it is doubtful whether the trilogues will start before the second half of 2019.


But the Silicon Valley carmaker reaffirmed its guidance to deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles this year, and said U.S. orders for its new Model 3 - which was recently made available for $35,000 - outpaced what the company was able to fulfill in the quarter.
Tesla, whose delivery numbers missed analysts\' expectations, said it had only delivered half of the quarter\'s numbers by March 21, with 10,600 vehicles still in transit at the end of the quarter. By comparison, only 1,900 vehicles were in transit at the end of the fourth quarter.
"Overall, the Street was expecting an apocalyptic quarter and Model 3 deliveries were better than feared by many," said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, who noted the overall number was "clearly rocky."
Lower deliveries in the first quarter had been expected, as Tesla shifted for the first time to delivering its new Model 3 to China and Europe in January and February, amid a slowdown in demand in North America and after a $7,500 tax credit was cut in half at the end of 2018.
On Wednesday, Tesla said net income in the quarter would be negatively impacted by the lower delivery and recent price cuts. The company warned in February that it would post a first-quarter loss.
Tesla delivered 50,900 Model 3s in the quarter, falling short of analysts\' estimates of 58,900, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Tesla delivered a total of 63,000 vehicles, including 12,100 Model S sedans and Model X SUVs. That was less than half the 27,550 Model S and Xs delivered in the fourth quarter.
Analyst Ives called S and X numbers poor, with Tesla focused on Model 3.
Total production fell 10.92 percent to 77,100 vehicles from 86,555 vehicles in fourth quarter. The company churned out 62,950 Model 3s, up from a total of 61,394 Model 3s in the fourth quarter.
The Model 3 is the linchpin of Tesla\'s growth strategy and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk is under pressure to deliver the vehicle to new international markets efficiently, while guarding working capital.
Musk has been engaged in a public battle with U.S. regulators stemming from his tweets about Tesla\'s production estimates and a judge will hear the case on Thursday.
Although Tesla said in late February that it would soon begin selling its originally promised $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan to its North American customers, the change came too late to make a marked difference in its quarterly deliveries.
NEW CHALLENGES
Delivering its Model 3 to international markets posed new challenges for Tesla. Musk tweeted that the company encountered "many unexpected challenges" when Model 3s came through the Belgian port of Zeebrugge in early February. More recently, misprinted labels delayed Model 3s entering through Shanghai.
The arrival of the Model 3 in Norway led to a surge in market share for Tesla in that country, with the car the biggest seller in Norway in March.
Still, some analysts have questioned the sustainability of global demand as European rivals roll out competing electric vehicles.
Too many vehicles in transit can put a strain on Tesla\'s working capital. Before Tesla\'s release, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimated that working capital could be tapped by as much as $800 million in the quarter due to such vehicles.
Tesla said it ended the quarter with "sufficient cash on hand."
As the company strives to improve margins and post profit later in 2019, the company has laid off workers, including about half of the team hired to deliver cars in the United States, and said it would close stores to lower costs. It has since said it would keep higher-volume stores open, while announcing a 3 percent price increase on some models.
Shares of Tesla closed up 2 percent on Wednesday to $291.81, before the announcement.

10.04.2019
(Brussels, 10 April 2019) They have travelled thousands of kilometres from Africa to come to the EU quarter: At today\'s solidarity rally close to the EU Council building, dairy farmers from Burkina Faso, Mali, and three other West African countries are standing side by side with dairy farmers from all over Europe. In a common declaration, they are calling for sustainable production in Europe and Africa to ensure the survival of important farming structures. This is against the backdrop of European overproduction and the current EU export orientation, which are jointly having a disastrous effect on the local dairy sector in West Africa.
\'Don\'t destroy local structures!\'
\'Many hundreds of thousands of families earn a living through milk production and processing,\' says Christian Dovonou, country director of Veterinarians Without Borders in Burkina Faso, while explaining the economic importance of milk production in West Africa. \'These local structures are put in danger as cheap imports from the EU increase further.\' Since 2016, EU exports of fat-filled milk powder to West Africa have increased by 24%. \'This mix of skimmed milk powder and vegetable oils is 30% cheaper than whole milk powder on African markets and is thus sold at a level that hinders the development of local milk and is similar to dumping prices.\'
\'The EU produces a lot of milk. Too much. To date, this problem has not been addressed at the source through appropriate instruments. Instead, export promotion, especially of cheap products, is seen as the only solution,\' says Thierry Kesteloot from Belgian development organisation Oxfam-Solidarité while describing the current situation. \'The victims end up being the people working in the dairy sector, especially women, who cannot compete with cheap exports from Europe,\' says Kesteloot.
In a common declaration, representatives from different African and European organisations have called for a balanced agricultural and trade policy in the European Union, so as to guarantee fair conditions for dairy farmers in Africa and Europe. In addition to representatives from Mali, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Mauritania and Niger, and European producers from the European Milk Board (EMB - umbrella organisation of 20 European dairy farmer associations), today\'s rally has been organised and conducted with development organisations Oxfam, SOS Faim and Veterinarians Without Borders.
Even though EU export subsidies are a thing of the past, dumping is still taking place because:
Direct payments help EU farmers finance production, which makes exports cheaper;
Due to major overproduction in the EU, prices paid by dairies to EU producers are well below production costs. This also makes cheap exports possible;
The process of re-fattening milk with vegetable oils means that milk products are made using cheap ingredients that are nothing like the natural product - making the final product cheaper as well.
Development of the local dairy sector instead of customs facilitation
Milk powder is often imported in 25kg sacks and can thus enjoy the very low common external tariff (CET) of 5% agreed by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). François Graas of SOS Faim says that imports should not be condemned en bloc as the demand for milk products cannot currently be fulfilled by local production alone. \'But there must be a balance and cheap imports cannot have the upper hand. It is also necessary to support local structures through development cooperation policy, because the local dairy sector has great potential for job creation and income generation.\'
As Ibrahima Aliou from Niger underlines, a well-developed dairy sector is the best guarantee against poverty and a rural exodus. Moreover, it offers young farmers a perspective. \'Policies in the global north and south must therefore promote the production, collection and processing of local milk instead of backing the import of subsidised surpluses,\' says Ibrahima Aliou. There is already a growing number of initiatives in West Africa that promote the local dairy sector.
And how do European dairy farmers profit from the significant trade with Africa?
Dairy farmers were told that the abolishment of milk quotas would usher in an era of significant export opportunities. The reality, however, is that EU producer prices are about 10 cents lower than production costs and the dairy sector has no effective crisis instrument in place. So, it is definitely not European dairy farmers who are reaping the profits of the growing global market.
The Common Agricultural Policy as an opportunity for dairy farmers locally and abroad
Erwin Schöpges, President of the European Milk Board (EMB), highlights the importance of an effective crisis instrument within the future EU agricultural policy. \'We cannot simply export the problem of European overproduction to Africa,\' says Schöpges, in solidarity with his African colleagues. The EMB is calling for a Market Responsibility Programme (MRP) that monitors the market and reacts quickly to looming crises - for example, through voluntary production cuts. \'As a dairy farmer, I wish for cost-covering prices, so that I am no longer dependent on direct payments that act as indirect export subsidies for our products in third countries.\' Schöpges is positive about the vote that took place in early April on the report regarding the review of the Common Market Regulation as part of the EU CAP reform. The Agriculture Committee of the European Parliament has thus spoken clearly in favour of voluntary volume reduction as an effective crisis instrument to address market disturbances.
Together with their colleagues in Europe, the representative from West Africa have the same appeal to EU policy-makers: \'Robust agricultural structures require committed producers and responsible policies. Please use the ongoing CAP reform to live up to this responsibility: Create effective instruments against damaging surpluses and dumping.\'

Luxembourg - The European Financial Stability Facility on Wednesday raised €3 billion in a new 16-year bond, leaving just €1 billion in funding needs for the remainder of the second quarter.
\'Today\'s transaction met with very strong demand, as we responded to heightened investor interest in the maturity range above 10 years. The 16-year deal fills a gap in our outstanding bond tenors, and demonstrates our strategy of maintaining presence on all parts of the yield curve\' said Siegfried Ruhl, EFSF Head of Funding and Investor Relations.
The spread of the 0.875% bond, which will mature on 10 April 2035, was fixed at mid swaps plus 2 basis points, for a reoffer yield of 0.951%. The order book was in excess of €11.7 billion.
Bookrunners for the deal were Barclays, BNP Paribas and DZ Bank.


European Medicines Agency confirms the current clinical and regulatory path for Chronocort®
Existing clinical data can be used to support a regulatory submission
Diurnal on track to submit Market Authorisation Application in Q4 2019
Diurnal Group plc (AIM: DNL), the specialty pharmaceutical company targeting patient needs in chronic endocrine (hormonal) diseases, announces today that, following a positive meeting with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in March 2019, the Company has received formal Scientific Advice from the EMA confirming the current clinical and regulatory path for Chronocort®as a treatment for patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Consequently,Diurnal intends to submit a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for Chronocort® (modified release hydrocortisone) in Q4 2019 based upon the existing clinical data, including additional data which will be required to support Orphan Drug Status in the treatment of CAH. This positive outcome follows the submission of a regulatory package requesting Scientific Advice to the EMA for Chronocort® based on detailed analysis of data from its Phase 3 study, the largest ever clinical trial programme in CAH, and the open-label safety extension study.
Martin Whitaker, Chief Executive Officer of Diurnal, commented: \'We welcome the outcome of our meeting with the EMA based on detailed analysis of data from our studies in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). This condition still results in significant increased morbidity and mortality for patients worldwide, with new therapies needed to improve these outcomes. We therefore continue to believe that Chronocort® represents a valuable treatment option for these patients, in a market estimated at $300 million in Europe, and we look forward to submitting a Marketing Authorisation Application in Q4 2019.\'
CAH is an orphan condition caused by a block in cortisol production, an essential adrenal steroid hormone required for healthy life. A lack of cortisol in turn causes the over-production of male steroid hormones (androgens). Cortisol deficiency and over-production of androgens can lead to increased mortality, infertility and severe development defects, including ambiguous genitalia, precocious puberty and short stature. Sufferers, even if treated, remain at risk of death through an adrenal crisis. The condition is estimated to affect a total of approximately 47,000 patients in Europe, with over 400,000 in the rest of the world.
This announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) 596/2014 (MAR).

About Chronocort®
Chronocort® is a modified release preparation of hydrocortisone that has been designed to mimic the circadian rhythm of cortisol when given in a twice-a-day \'toothbrush\' regimen (last thing at night before sleep and first thing in the morning on waking) to control androgen excess and chronic fatigue in patients with diseases of cortisol deficiency. The first planned indication for Chronocort® is Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) in adults. Chronocort® has been extensively studied in humans having completed four Phase I trials, a Phase II trial in 16 CAH patients in the US in 2014, and a Phase III trial in 122 CAH patients in Europe.
In Europe, Chronocort® has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the treatment of CAH, which, if confirmed at marketing authorisation, provides market exclusivity for 10 years. The market authorisation of Chronocort® in Europe is anticipated in 2020.
About Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an orphan condition caused by deficiency of adrenal enzymes, most commonly 21-hydroxylase. This enzyme is required to produce the adrenal steroid hormone, cortisol. The block in the cortisol production pathway causes the over-production of male steroid hormones (androgens), which are precursors to cortisol. The condition is congenital (inherited at birth) and affects both sexes. The cortisol deficiency and over-production of male sex hormones can lead to increased mortality, infertility and severe development defects including ambiguous genitalia, premature (precocious) sexual development and short stature. Sufferers, even if treated, remain at risk of death through an adrenal crisis.
Current therapy for CAH uses a variety of generic steroids (hydrocortisone, dexamethasone and prednisolone). Approximately two-thirds of CAH patients are estimated to have poor disease control, leading to elevated androgen levels. The condition is estimated to affect a total of approximately 47,000 patients in Europe, with over 400,000 in the rest of the world.
About Diurnal Group plc
Founded in 2004, Diurnal is a UK-based specialty pharma company developing high quality products for the global market for the life-long treatment of chronic endocrine conditions, including Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia and Adrenal Insufficiency.

The European Parliament and the Council have reached a provisional agreement on stronger and better enforced consumer protection rules.
The main improvements will be more transparency for consumers when buying online, effective penalties and clear rules to tackle the issue of dual quality of products in the EU. The European Commission proposed the new rules in April last year as part of the New Deal for Consumers.
First Vice-President Timmermans said: \'This is about protecting consumers through more transparency, and robust enforcement if customers are duped. With this New Deal consumers will know what they\'re buying and from whom they\'re buying it.\'
Věra Jourová, Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality added: With this deal the days of double standards in the Single Market are numbered. Consumers should no longer be misled by different products presented as identical. Traders who will continue to cheat will face high sanctions. The New Deal will also beef up consumer protection in the online world and make online shopping more transparent.
The adopted measures will bring tangible benefits for consumers:
With effective penalties for violations of EU consumer law: national consumer authorities will have the power to impose effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties in a coordinated manner. For widespread infringements that affect consumers in several EU Member States and that are subject to EU coordinated enforcement, the available maximum fine in each Member State will be not less than 4% of the trader\'s annual turnover.
By tackling dual quality of consumer goods:the new rules clarify that marketing a product as being identical to the same product in other Member States, when in reality those goods have significantly unjustified different composition or characteristics, would be a misleading practice.
With strengthened consumer rights online: when buying from an online market place, consumers will have to be clearly informed about whether they are buying goods or services from a trader or from a private person, so they know what protection they will benefit from if something goes wrong. When searching online, consumers will be clearly informed when a search result is being paid for by a trader. They will also be informed about the main parameters determining the ranking of search results.
Next steps
This provisional agreement now has to be formally adopted by both the European Parliament and the Council.
Background
The New Deal for Consumers package aims to build on what the Juncker Commission has already achieved to improve consumer protection.
Under the Digital Single Market Strategy, the European Commission has delivered on many initiatives that adapt consumer rules to the online world, for instance by putting an end to roaming charges or unjustified geoblocking. Also, the modernised Consumer Protection Cooperation Regulation, adopted in 2017, will improve the public enforcement and cross-border cooperation of consumer authorities.
The New Deal for Consumers was composed of two proposals for Directives:
A proposal on representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers and repealing the Injunctions Directive 2009/22/EC. This proposal aims to improve tools for stopping illegal practices and facilitating redress for consumers where many of them are victims of the same infringement of their rights, in a mass harm situation. The work on this second Directive continues in the European Parliament and the Council.

Committee on Petitions
29.3.2019
NOTICE TO MEMBERS
Subject: Petition 0282/2011 by M. L. (Spanish), on alleged discrimination as regards the payment of taxes in Spain
1.Summary of petition
The petitioner points out that non-residents, regardless of their nationality, pay between 35% and 45% in tax on real estate when it changes hands or is inherited. The petitioner believes this to be discriminatory when compared to residents, who, in some cases - for instance in Madrid - pay a symbolic tax of only 1%.
2.Admissibility
Declared admissible on 15 June 2011. Information requested from Commission under Rule 216(6).
3.Commission reply, received on 6 September 2011
Under the previous Spanish legislation, non-resident individuals were always subject to a substantially higher tax burden than residents if they sold their property after one year of possession, and were so in most cases, if the property was sold within a year after acquisition. Spain amended the legislation. Since 1 January 2007, income from capital gains is taxed at the flat rate of 18%, irrespective of the period of accrual and irrespective of whether the taxpayer is resident in Spain or not.
However, due to the fact that there were many cases that suffered from the application of discriminatory rules and that the Spanish legislation did not provide for any remedy to such situations, the Commission brought an action to the Court of Justice of the European Union.
On 6 October 2009, the Court of Justice of the European Union decided that:

EN
"Declares that, by treating differently, until 31 December 2006, capital gains realised in Spain according to whether they were made by residents or by non-residents, the Kingdom of Spain failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 56 EC and Article 40 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area of 2 May 1992 "
As regards the Spanish inheritance and gift tax, the European Commission has requested Spain to change them as it considers that they imposed a higher tax burden on non-residents or on assets or rights held abroad. The European Commission considered that the Spanish provisions are incompatible with the free movement of workers and capital provided for in Articles 21 and 63 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Articles 28 and 40 of the EEA Agreement. For this reason, it decided to open an infringement procedure against Spain. In April 2010 the Commission sent a reasoned opinion to Spain (the second step of the infringement procedure provided for in Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). After analysing the Spanish reply to the reasoned opinion, the European Commission decided to send an additional reasoned opinion. Currently, the Commission is assessing the Spanish reply to the additional reasoned opinion. If the European Commission is not fully satisfied with the reply, it might propose to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union.
4.Commission reply (REV.), received on 16 March 2012
Under the previous Spanish legislation, non-resident individuals were always subject to a substantially higher tax burden than residents if they sold their property after one year of possession, and were so in most cases, if the property was sold within a year after acquisition. Spain amended the legislation. Since 1 January 2007, income from capital gains is taxed at the flat rate of 18%, irrespective of the period of accrual and irrespective of whether the taxpayer is resident in Spain or not.
However, due to the fact that many cases of application of discriminatory rules were reported and that the Spanish legislation did not provide for any remedy to such situations, the Commission brought an action to the Court of Justice of the European Union.
On 6 October 2009, the Court of Justice of the European Union decided that:
"Declares that, by treating differently, until 31 December 2006, capital gains realised in Spain according to whether they were made by residents or by non-residents, the Kingdom of Spain failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 56 EC and Article 40 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area of 2 May 1992 "
Individual persons should always seek redress from national administrative or judicial authorities. Despite the fact that the Court of Justice has found the Spanish rules to be incompatible with the Treaty, such a finding cannot "per se" resolve individual cases. Its purpose is merely to oblige Member States to bring their legislation into line with Community law, and it is for individuals to bring the matter before a national authority.

This is considered incompatible with the free movement of workers and capital provided for in Articles 21 and 63 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Articles 28 and 40 of the EEA Agreement. For this reason, the Commission decided to open an infringement procedure against Spain. In October 2011, the European Commission decided to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Court of Justice has not yet decided on this case.
5.Commission reply (REV II), received on 31 May 2017
Further to its previous replies, the Commission services would like to add that the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) issued a ruling on 3 September 2014 in the case C- 127/12, Commission versus Spain, declaring that Spain has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 63 TFEU and 40 of the EEA Agreement by allowing differences in the tax treatment of donations and inheritances between heirs and the recipients of the donations depending on whether they are residents and non-residents in Spain, between deceased residents and non-residents in Spain and between the donation of immovable property situated in Spain and that situated abroad.
Since 1 January 20151, Spain has amended its legislation to align the tax regime of taxpayers resident in another Member State of the EU or of the EEA with the CJEU judgment.
Currently, the Commission is running an EU Pilot procedure with Spain aimed at extending the amendments of the Spanish legislation to third-country residents in order to fully implement the CJEU judgment.
6.Commission reply (REV. III), received on 30 November 2018
The Spanish Supreme Court has issued three awards (cases 62/2017, 488/2018 and 492/2018) where they apply the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In particular, these rulings recognize the right of residents in non-EU Member states to the free movement of capital as enshrined in article 63 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFUE). They state that these residents should not be discriminated vis-à-vis Spanish residents when they are subject to Inheritance tax.
The issue submitted to the CJEU was the impossibility of non-resident taxpayers to pay the tax according to the rules approved by the Autonomous Communities whereby a number of tax reductions and allowances had been provided for. Instead, they had to calculate the tax according to the general rules approved by the State. According to the CJEU, non-resident taxpayers should be eligible for these tax reductions and allowances as provided for resident taxpayers by the Autonomous Communities.
The Commission services will request information from the Spanish authorities on the measures to be adopted following these decisions so as to assess whether they are aligned with EU Law.

7.Commission reply (REV. IV), received on 29 March 2019
At the request of the Commission, the Spanish Ministry of Finance informed that they have made public the resolution of a tax ruling, "consulta vinculante" V3151-18 of 11 December 2018 where it applies the case-law of the CJEU and of the Spanish Supreme Court. According to this decision, residents from third countries can claim the application of the tax reductions and bonifications adopted by the Autonomous Communities. The result is that there will be no restriction on the free movement of capital as enshrined in the TFEU to residents in third countries not parties to this Treaty.
Conclusion
In the context of the EU Pilot1 opened by the Commission, the Commission is contacting the complainants in this case to verify that this new administrative practice addresses their concerns. Being this the case, the EU pilot procedure should be closed if no new information to the contrary reaches the Commission services.

The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today clarifications to the second set of issues raised and discussed by participants of its Working Group (WG) on APIs under PSD2. The issues relate to API performance and support, the provision of a list of Third Party Providers (TPPs) that are interested in testing, the testing by TPPs that are not authorised, and the timelines applicable across the EEA if Account Servicing Payment Service Providers (ASPSPs) want to be exempted from the fall-back mechanism.
Background and next steps
In January this year, the EBA established a Working Group (WG) on APIs under PSD2, consisting of 30 individuals representing account servicing payment service providers (ASPSPs), third party providers (TPPs), API schemes, and others market participants. The aim of the group is to facilitate industry preparedness for the Regulatory Technical Standard (RTS) on Strong Customer Authentication and Common and Secure Communication and to support the development of high-performing and customer-focused APIs under PSD2.
The group is tasked with identifying issues and challenges that market participants face during the testing and use of API interfaces in the period leading up to the application date of the RTS on 14 September 2019. The group is also asked to propose solutions on how the identified issues could addressed, which the EBA and national authorities will then consider.
On 11 March 2019, the EBA published clarifications to the first set of issues raised by its working group. Today\'s publications is the response to the second set of issues that the group had raised. In the weeks and months to come, the EBA will add further clarifications.

The European Union\'s (EU) banking, insurance, pensions and securities sectors continue to face a range of risks, the latest report on \'Risks and Vulnerabilities in the EU Financial System\' published today by the Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) shows.
The 2019 Spring ESAs\' report highlights the following risks as potential sources of instability:
Uncertainties around the terms of the United Kingdom\'s withdrawal from the European Union.
Further repricing of risk premia and asset price volatility, which could be aggravated in conjunction with a less favourable macro-economic environment and the materialisation of a no-deal Brexit scenario.
In light of the ongoing uncertainties, especially those around Brexit, supervisory vigilance and cooperation across all sectors remains key. Therefore, the ESAs calls for the following policy actions by European and national competent authorities (NCAs) as well as financial institutions:
Contingency Plans: It is crucial that European Union financial institutions, market participants and their counterparties enact timely contingency plans to prepare for the United Kingdom\'s withdrawal from the European Union, including possible market volatility a no-deal Brexit may trigger. The ESAs are closely monitoring Brexit developments and the possible associated risks of a no-deal scenario. The ESAs issued Opinions and Recommendations to provide important guidance for financial institutions, market participants and NCAs in this regard.

The ESAs issued Opinions and Recommendations to provide important guidance for financial institutions, market participants and NCAs in this regard.
Stress Tests: Against the backdrop of the potential for sudden risk premia reversals with a risk of rising funding costs, the development and regular use of stress tests across all sectors remains crucial. Therefore, the scenarios for the 2018 bank and insurance stress tests conducted by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) reflected these risks. Furthermore, the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) will present guidelines on fund liquidity and Money Market Fund stress testing during 2019. ESMA is also preparing its next Central Counter Parties (CCPs) stress test. The EBA has started to prepare the methodology for its 2020 stress test exercise, and EIOPA launched its 2019 Occupational Pensions Stress Test.

Banks: Banks should develop strategies to carefully manage and address large refinancing needs, including building loss-absorbing capacity. In addition, banks should continue with efforts to address the stocks of non-performing loans (NPLs), and should review their business model to improve profitability. In addition, it is important that banks carefully manage their credit risk and interest rate risk. New bank lending has started to increase and warrants close monitoring of credit quality trends of new lending portfolios. Banks need to ensure that lending standards and covenant requirements do not weaken. The financial sector and banks in particular, need to manage their sovereign exposure carefully, which might imply a significant impact on their profitability and capital.

Insurance: Supervisors and insurance companies need to ensure that risks of a potentially sudden reassessment of risk premia and continued low interest rates are properly monitored and analysed as well as appropriate mitigating actions taken. In this context, the vulnerabilities identified in EIOPA\'s 2018 Insurance Stress Test need to be addressed.
EU financial regulators highlight risks of a no-deal Brexit and asset price volatility
Background
The Joint Committee is the forum for cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs).

Analysing the martian atmosphere
First results from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter
10 April 2019
New evidence of the impact of the recent planet-encompassing dust storm on water in the atmosphere, and a surprising lack of methane, are among the scientific highlights of the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter\'s first year in orbit.
Two papers are published in the journal Nature today describing the new results, and reported in a dedicated press briefing at the European Geosciences Union in Vienna.
A third paper, submitted to the Proceedings of the Russian Academy of Science, presents the most detailed map ever produced of water-ice or hydrated minerals in the shallow subsurface of Mars.
The joint ESA-Roscosmos ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, or TGO, arrived at the Red Planet in October 2016, and spent more than one year using the aerobraking technique needed to reach its two-hour science orbit, 400 km above the surface of Mars.
\'We are delighted with the first results from the Trace Gas Orbiter,\' says Håkan Svedhem, ESA\'s TGO project scientist.
\'Our instruments are performing extremely well and even within the first few months of observation were already providing exquisite data to a much higher level than previously achieved.\'
First results from TGO
TGO\'s main science mission began at the end of April 2018, just a couple of months before the start of the global dust storm that would eventually lead to the demise of NASA\'s Opportunity rover after 15 years roving the martian surface.
Spacecraft in orbit, however, were able to make unique observations, with TGO following the onset and development of the storm and monitoring how the increase in dust affected the water vapour in the atmosphere - important for understanding the history of water at Mars over time.
Exploiting the dust storm
Two spectrometers onboard - NOMAD and ACS - made the first high-resolution solar occultation measurements of the atmosphere, looking at the way sunlight is absorbed in the atmosphere to reveal the chemical fingerprints of its ingredients.
This enabled the vertical distribution of water vapour and \'semi-heavy\' water - with one hydrogen atom replaced by a deuterium atom, a form of hydrogen with an additional neutron - to be plotted from close to the martian surface to above 80 km altitude. The new results track the influence of dust in the atmosphere on water, along with the escape of hydrogen atoms into space.
\'In the northern latitudes we saw features such as dust clouds at altitudes of around 25-40 km that were not there before, and in southern latitudes we saw dust layers moving to higher altitudes,\' says Ann Carine Vandaele, principal investigator of the NOMAD instrument at the Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy.
\'The enhancement of water vapour in the atmosphere happened remarkably quickly, over just a few days during the onset of the storm, indicating a swift reaction of the atmosphere to the dust storm.\'
Dust storm evolution
The observations are consistent with global circulation models. Dust absorbs the Sun\'s radiation, heating the surrounding gas and causing it to expand, in turn redistributing other ingredients - like water - over a wider vertical range. A higher temperature contrast between equatorial and polar regions is also set up, strengthening atmospheric circulation. At the same time, thanks to the higher temperatures, fewer water-ice clouds form - normally they would confine water vapour to lower altitudes.
The teams also made the first observation of semi-heavy water simultaneously with water vapour, providing key information on the processes that control the amount of hydrogen and deuterium atoms escaping to space. It also means the deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H) ratio can be derived, which is an important marker for the evolution of the water inventory on Mars.
\'We see that water, deuterated or not, is very sensitive to the presence of ice clouds, preventing it from reaching atmospheric layers higher up. During the storm, water reached much higher altitudes,\' says Ann Carine.\'This was theoretically predicted by models for a long time but this is the first time we have been able to observe it.\'
Since the D/H ratio is predicted to change with the season and with latitude, TGO\'s continued regional and seasonal measurements are expected to provide further evidence of the processes at play.
Methane mystery plot thickens
The two complementary instruments also started their measurements of trace gases in the martian atmosphere. Trace gases occupy less than one percent of the atmosphere by volume, and require highly precise measurement techniques to determine their exact chemical fingerprints in the composition. The presence of trace gases is typically measured in \'parts per billion by volume\' (ppbv), so for the example for Earth\'s methane inventory measuring 1800 ppbv, for every billion molecules, 1800 are methane.
Methane is of particular interest for Mars scientists, because it can be a signature of life, as well as geological processes - on Earth, for example, 95% of methane in the atmosphere comes from biological processes. Because it can be destroyed by solar radiation on timescales of several hundred years, any detection of the molecule in present times implies it must have been released relatively recently - even if the methane itself was produced millions or billions of years ago and remained trapped in underground reservoirs until now. In addition, trace gases are mixed efficiently on a daily basis close to the planet\'s surface, with global wind circulation models dictating that methane would be mixed evenly around the planet within a few months.
Reports of methane in the martian atmosphere have been intensely debated because detections have been very sporadic in time and location, and often fell at the limit of the instruments\' detection limits. ESA\'s Mars Express contributed one of the first measurements from orbit in 2004, at that time indicating the presence of methane amounting to 10 ppbv.
Earth-based telescopes have also reported both non-detections and transient measurements up to about 45 ppbv, while NASA\'s Curiosity rover, exploring Gale Crater since 2012, has suggested a background level of methane that varies with the seasons between about 0.2 and 0.7 ppbv - with some higher level spikes. More recently, Mars Express observed a methane spike one day after one of Curiosity\'s highest-level readings.
TGO\'s search for methane on Mars
The new results from TGO provide the most detailed global analysis yet, finding an upper limit of 0.05 ppbv, that is, 10-100 times less methane than all previous reported detections. The most precise detection limit of 0.012 ppbv was achieved at 3 km altitude.
As an upper limit, 0.05 ppbv still corresponds to up to 500 tons of methane emitted over a 300 year predicted lifetime of the molecule when considering atmospheric destruction processes alone, but dispersed over the entire atmosphere, this is extremely low.
\'We have beautiful, high-accuracy data tracing signals of water within the range of where we would expect to see methane, but yet we can only report a modest upper limit that suggests a global absence of methane,\' says ACS principal investigator Oleg Korablev from the Space Research Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow.
\'The TGO\'s high-precision measurements seem to be at odds with previous detections; to reconcile the various datasets and match the fast transition from previously reported plumes to the apparently very low background levels, we need to find a method that efficiently destroys methane close to the surface of the planet.\'
\'Just as the question of the presence of methane and where it might be coming from has caused so much debate, so the issue of where it is going, and how quickly it can disappear, is equally interesting,\' says Håkan.
\'We don\'t have all the pieces of the puzzle or see the full picture yet, but that is why we are there with TGO, making a detailed analysis of the atmosphere with the best instruments we have, to better understand how active this planet is - whether geologically or biologically.\'
Key methane measurements at Mars
Best map of shallow subsurface water
While the lively debate on the nature and presence of methane continues, one sure thing is that water once existed on Mars - and still does in the form of water-ice, or as water-hydrated minerals. And where there was water, there might have been life.
To help understand the location and history of water on Mars, TGO\'s neutron detector FREND is mapping the distribution of hydrogen in the uppermost metre of the planet\'s surface. Hydrogen indicates the presence of water, being one of the constituents of the water molecule; it can also indicate water absorbed into the surface, or minerals that were formed in the presence of water.
The instrument\'s mapping task will take about one Mars year - almost two Earth years - to produce the best statistics to generate the highest quality map. But the first maps presented based on just a few month\'s data already exceed the resolution of previous measurements.
Shallow subsurface water distribution on Mars
\'In just 131 days the instrument had already produced a map that has a higher resolution than that of the 16 years data from its predecessor onboard NASA\'s Mars Odyssey - and it is set to continue getting better,\' says Igor Mitrofanov, principal investigator of the FREND instrument at the Space Research Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow.
Aside from the obviously water-rich permafrost of the polar regions, the new map provides more refined details of localised \'wet\' and \'dry\' regions. It also highlights water-rich materials in equatorial regions that may signify the presence of water-rich permafrost in present times, or the former locations of the planet\'s poles in the past.
\'The data is continually improving and we will eventually have what will become the reference data for mapping shallow subsurface water-rich materials on Mars, crucial for understanding the overall evolution of Mars and where all the present water is now,\' adds Igor. \'It is important for the science on Mars, and it is also valuable for future Mars exploration.\'
\'We have already been enjoying beautiful images and stereo views of Mars thanks to the TGO\'s imaging system and now we are delighted to share the first look at data from the other instruments,\' concludes Håkan.
\'We have a promising future in contributing to the many fascinating aspects of Mars science, from the distribution of subsurface water, to active surface processes and to the mysteries of the martian atmosphere.\'

With an emergency EU summit over Brexit and an ECB policy meeting on the agenda, officials will be under pressure to take decisive steps to soothe concerns ahead of a set-piece gathering of the global financial elite in Washington.
But the temptation will be great to stick with the bloc\'s rich tradition of just kicking the can down the road.
The deadline for Britain to leave the EU, seen as set in stone just days ago, is again in flux as both sides are openly discussing an extension, even if that means Britain must cross another red line by participating in May\'s European elections.
The apparent softening of British Prime Minister Theresa May\'s position suggests the end game is far from imminent.
Another EU summit muddle would, however, keep economic uncertainty at fever pitch, weighing on sentiment that is already dragging down growth across Europe and raising recession fears.
A long extension - and taking part in EU elections - also carries the risk of a Conservative Party mutiny, which could force an already weakened May out.
"Such leadership changes are always unpredictable and, in this instance could be brutal, with more centrist elements of the party struggling against a membership whose views on Brexit are increasingly hardline," JP Morgan economic Malcolm Barr said.
But blurring the red lines suggests Britain is keen to avoid the most damaging of all outcomes - a hard Brexit.
For the EU, a longer extension also carries the benefit that Britain\'s departure would not occur during the crucial month of the election campaign, which will determine who leads both the EU and, after Mario Draghi\'s term ends this autumn, the European Central Bank.
Taking a hard Brexit off the table would also allow British officials to put on a brave face at the IMF\'s spring meeting in Washington starting on Friday, letting the gathering focus on broader trade issues.
NARROW PATH
Still, the delay solves little in itself.
Any concession by May to win votes on a deal from Britain\'s opposition Labour Party is likely to lose her Conservative MPs.
That suggests the path to any majority outcome is quite narrow, keeping the chance of an eventual no-deal Brexit uncomfortably high.
"Despite the switch to a cross-party approach, the risk of an election remains high because the path toward a successful \'meaningful vote\' is treacherous, due to the deep divisions
within both parties," Andrew Goodwin at Oxford Economics said.
The cost of the Brexit saga is already tangible for the EU.
Global trade tensions are weighing even more heavily, and the steady flow of bad news is keeping investment and business sentiment in a negative spiral, depressing growth for the third straight quarter.
The ECB, the bloc\'s first port of call in case of growth weakness, has already eased policy, exhausting much of its firepower during years of crisis fighting. More generally, central banks lack potent tools to offset imported economic troubles.
Having already delayed a rate hike, the ECB will sit on the sidelines for now, while economists expect more easing later in the year.
"Since the main refinancing rate is already at zero percent, such easing is likely to amount to further unconventional measures," Commerzbank said.
"We therefore expect the ECB to decide in the autumn ...to promise unchanged key rates ...until the end of 2020," it added.

The Commission has the moral obligation to react to ECIs, said First Vice-President Frans Timmermans
Today\'s 8th ECI Day marks a special step forward for the European Citizens\' Initiative (ECI). We are proud that, not least because of the endeavours of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) and particularly the annual ECI Day, it was finally possible to revise the ECI. So today we are very pleased to welcome First Vice-President Timmermans, who will present a simplified and improved tool for genuine citizen participation, said Christophe Lefevre, EESC member and president of the ECI ad-hoc group, who opened the 8th European Citizens\' Day on 2 April on behalf of EESC President Luca Jahier.
Digitalisation to show the common cause
Laura Sullivan, founder of WeMove.EU, said that EU level decisions required transnational mobilisation, but that she observed a sort of distance between Europeans and the EU. Even most organised civil society groups are only mobilising at national level, she said. Furthermore, far-right, nationalist, Eurosceptic political groups were on the rise.
Digital activism could mobilise larger groups and therefore it should complement offline activism. Digital engagement could help to better shape decision-making at EU level and raise awareness of how the EU works. It would also help to show evidence of our commonalities and common cause and help to build more solidarity and engagement across peoples in Europe. \'We have more in common than we are often aware of\', she stated.
ECIs express people\'s concerns and should trigger political debate
Finally, First Vice-President Frans Timmermans presented the updated European Citizens\' Initiative, which had already been approved by the European Parliament on 12 March 2019 and is to be adopted by the Council by the end of April.
The new ECI will make it possible to collect signatures online;
A collaborative platform will offer practical assistance to organisers;
Organisers will now have six months instead of three months after registration to choose when to start collecting signatures;
The Commission on the other hand will now be able to partially register an initiative. In particular, this will be the case when the Commission only has the power to propose legislation on some of the objectives of the ECI and not on all.
Mr Timmermans regretted that he was not able to convince Member States to lower the minimum age for signing an ECI to 16. This was for me the most difficult thing to swallow, the Commissioner confessed.
The fact that 17 ECIs are currently in the registration process, while even 9 of them launched in 2019, shows not only that the Commission\'s communication campaign was successful, but also that citizens have trust in the ECI tool.
In his speech, the Commissioner raised the political dimension of an ECI: There is no obligation that promoters of an ECI get what they want. In my view, however, there is a moral and political obligation for the Commission to react and engage in a political debate. People expect us to be clear about what should be done and what cannot be done.
The challenge for the next European Commission was to assess how digital and democracy work together in an effective way, which included reinventing our democracy and adapting it to the kind of world in which people now live.
ECI Day 2019 on Digital Voices
\'Digitial Voices\' was the theme of the 2019 ECI Day. Digital natives no longer wait for elections to express their preferences; they voice their concerns all the time and at every opportunity.
In two workshops, participants sought to reflect the ongoing changes in global trends in voting and active citizen participation.
Denying what is voiced in the digital world would be ignorant and even stupid, said Mr Lefevre, but EU institutions and governments must be wise about how to adapt to this trend and have a particular responsibility regarding correct information and upholding morals and politeness.
The findings of the two workshops will be published on the EESC website.


U.S. And European Freight Railroads Are On Different Tracks
FreightWaves 4/3/2019 12:28:53 PM
Rail cars using steel wheels on steel rails move freight in both the United States and Europe. Yet there are fundamental differences between the railroads in the U.S. and those in Europe. Why? What are some of the more critical reasons for the differences?
Culture is one very big reason. A second is the metrics that each region regards as the definition of a railway\'s enterprise success.
The United States culture is private enterprise-driven. Without going too deep into the legal definitions and interpretations, the U.S. Constitution protects private property and the use thereof through the Fourth Amendment (protection from \'unreasonable searches and seizures\' by the government) and the Fifth Amendment protects the right to private property (including unreasonable seizure). Yes, there is a body of regulatory rules and procedures governing railroad property use and rates. But this is very different than in Europe.
Overall, Europe long ago converted from private railroad companies to nationalized railways (Switzerland might be among the most notable exceptions). By and large, the European Union has no Constitution like that of the USA.
In western Europe the legislative and administrative governmental bodies tend to favor the mass movement of people by trains. A Eurostat 2012-13 report shows that about 79 percent of European train miles are generated by passenger trains. This is driven by public policy and financial backing from taxpayers.
Increasing rail freight movement is a long-term public policy priority in Europe, but realistically rail freight is not the primary role for trains on the continent. Yes, there are a few exceptions. Freight rail use in parts of eastern Europe and across the Swiss Alps is heavier than for Europe overall.
In stark contrast, railway freight is the king of the train paths in the USA. A few of the largest urban areas - like New York City and the Northeast Corridor - are dominated by Amtrak passenger trains. But they are the exceptions.
The U.S. main rail lines are comprised of more than 50,000 route miles. More than 95 percent of these route miles are traveled by freight trains. For many of those lines/miles, there are no passenger trains because of Amtrak\'s system, which was created in 1970.
The Europeans are experimenting with some private freight railroad train operators, which operate over the nationalized railroads\' tracks. A number of these private corridor freight train operations are financially successful and offer some very unique short-train and short-market lengths, as well as high-quality customer freight services. These private operators are pioneering short-haul intermodal and short-haul finished automotive distribution services. Interestingly, those sectors have not been profitable for U.S. railroads to operate.
Differences in metrics
Geography plays a role in rail freight\'s ability to compete with trucks (and in Europe also with barges on rivers and short-haul sea vessels). The typical railroad freight traffic might travel 1,100 to 1,800 miles in the western U.S. and 400 to 600 miles on average in the eastern U.S. In contrast, overall railroad freight movement in Europe is generally between 100 to 200 miles.
The U.S. freight railroads have command of train dispatching and they typically run \'big technology\' freight trains with between 3,000 trailing tons up to a maximum of 10,000 to 14,000 trailing tons. In Europe - with the need to assure passenger trains paths - freight trains are operated in the 300 to 400 trailing tons range,
Also notable is that European axle weights are limited to 20 to 23 metric tons. In contrast, U.S., Canadian and Mexican rail freight is moved in cars (freight wagons) at typically 30, 33 and even 35 metric tons per axle. Most freight wagons in both Europe and in North America operate with four axles sets.
The length of a freight train is also used to measure productivity. In the U.S., freight trains are often 3,500 meters (2.175 miles) in length; in western Europe, freight train lengths are closer to 750 meters (less than one-half mile).
As a result, the unit costs per train in Europe are relatively high - and prices paid by shippers are much higher than a U.S. freight rail customer would pay over a similar distance. For these reasons, the cost per ton of moving freight by rail is much lower in the U.S. than in Europe. So are customer prices paid.
In the U.S. (and also in Canada), freight railroad profitability is very high. Operating income margins for rail freight are typically in the 30 to 40 percent range, (which translates to an operating ratio of 60 to 70). Operating ratios are a company\'s operating expenses as a percentage of revenue and are often used to gauge the efficiency of a company\'s management. Railroads and other industries that require a large percentage of revenues to maintain operations use operating ratio as a measure of competency; the lower the operating ratio the better. In railroading, an operating ratio of 80 or lower is considered desirable.
The profitability of the European rail freight operating companies is much lower. A 2010 report showed that in all cases, the seven largest railroads in the U.S. had positive operating income (operating expenses were lower than the revenues earned). However, some of the newly established European \'open access\' freight railroad companies actually lost money on an income statement basis.
A railroad\'s margin as a percentage of revenue also tells a story. In the U.S. the percentages range from 28 to 34 percent; in western Europe the average is less than 12 percent. What makes this even more interesting, the average rate that railroads charge to haul freight is two to three times higher in Europe than in the U.S.
The European railroad freight business model adds additional complexity. Because of public policy, the nationalized railroads retain complete public/taxpayer-owned infrastructure ownership of rails, rights of way, bridges and other rail real estate. Some nationalized railway corporations like DB operate their own freight trains. These trains compete with the growing number of private freight train operating companies such as CP Cargo.
In the U.S., many freight trains are comprised in large part (and sometimes completely) of privately leased or privately-owned freight cars - and operate frequently as dedicated train sets under privately negotiated contracts for track time and rail company haulage. These arrangements are largely unregulated by the government.
Conversely, EU policy requires a separation between the nationalized train operations and track access charges for rail freight. That appears to be \'a work principle still in evolution.\'
The takeaway
Both the U.S. and European business models provide railway freight functionality. Both have government regulatory oversight and rules. Each model requires a different set of funding and investment risk taken by both investors and the rail company owners. In today\'s environment, the investment and failure risks in the U.S. business model are pretty small.
Both the European and U.S. rail freight models face an environment in which they are increasingly in competition with trucks to haul freight. Moreover, both models face a market share growth rate outlook that is static to small at best. At worst, both models face significant long-term loss of freight market share to other modes of transport. Neither model guarantees continued market share stability. At least not yet.
Selected railway corridors connecting origin and destination markets with reasonably high traffic volumes per day or week appear to offer the best opportunities for either model to sustain or even selectively grow rail freight market share. For example, that might be the 2,200-mile Los Angeles to Chicago lane in the United States. In Europe, it might be the Hamburg, Germany to Italy via Switzerland lane.
Time will tell.

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., April 7, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced new data presented from a cross-sectional study revealing a gap in the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis in Europe. The real-world study of osteoporosis management in primary care revealed that 75 percent of female patients aged 70 years and older who were at increased risk of fragility fractures were not treated for osteoporosis. The treatment gap was much lower in those with a recorded diagnosis of osteoporosis than in those without a recorded diagnosis. The results of the study, which was performed across eight European countries, were presented during the World Congress on Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (WCO-IOF-ESCEO), in Paris from April 4-7, 2019.
"This study assessed patterns of real-world osteoporosis diagnosis and medical treatment in the European primary care setting," said Eugene McCloskey, M.D., FRCPI, Professor of Adult Bone Diseases at The University of Sheffield and Director of the MRC Arthritis Research UK Centre for Integrated Research in Musculoskeletal Ageing. "Based on the results, future strategies need to increase awareness and facilitate the diagnosis of patients at risk in order to improve the treatment of osteoporosis and prevent fragility fractures from happening."
The study enrolled 3,798 women aged 70 years or older after spontaneously visiting their primary care physician for any reason, not specifically related to their bone health. The primary outcome of the study was to assess the proportion of patients at increased risk of fragility fracture who were not receiving osteoporosis medication. Nearly 55 percent (n=2,077/3,798) of patients were considered to be at increased risk of fragility fracture, with 75 percent (n=1,550/2,077) of them not being medically treated for osteoporosis. Further, the study showed that among these untreated patients at risk for fracture, 85 percent (n=1,318/1,550) had no recorded diagnosis of osteoporosis.
"This real-world study further proves that an underdiagnosis of osteoporosis in Europe is a major barrier to treatment," said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. "The finding that the vast majority of patients at increased risk of fracture remain untreated underscores the drastic need for better osteoporosis management and reinforces our ongoing commitment to help address this worldwide public health crisis1 and improve the care for millions of people living with this disease."
About the Study
This cross-sectional study was conducted across eight European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland and the United Kingdom). The study included 3,798 community-dwelling women aged 70 years or older (median age 77 years) spontaneously visiting their primary care physician mainly for existing conditions (follow up for known disease 52.1 percent, medication refill 20.6 percent, new symptoms 21.7 percent).
Patient demographics, treatment history and clinical risk factors were collected via self-reported questionnaires and medical records. The primary objective was to assess the proportion of women at increased risk of fragility fracture and not receiving osteoporosis medication. Increased risk of fragility fracture was defined as at least one of (1) history of previous fractures after age 50, (2) FRAX®-score (10-year probability of hip and major osteoporotic fracture above country-specific FRAX thresholds), (3) bone densitometry (DXA) results (bone mineral density T-score of -2.5 or less).
Prevalence of FRAX risk factors ranged from 32 percent (prior fracture) to 1 percent (alcohol 3 or more units/day). 2,077 women (55 percent, median age 80 years) were determined to be at increased fracture risk, but only 31 percent of these had a recorded diagnosis of osteoporosis. For the primary outcome, 75 percent (95 percent CI: 72.7-76.5 percent) of women at increased risk of fragility fracture were not receiving any osteoporosis medication; this treatment gap was much lower in those with a recorded diagnosis of osteoporosis than in those without a recorded diagnosis. A small proportion of patients who did not meet the study definition of increased risk for fragility fracture had a previous diagnosis of osteoporosis (10 percent).
About Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis affects many women after menopause as their ability to form new bone cannot counter balance the rate at which bone is being removed.2,3 This bone loss leads to weakened bones over time, increasing the potential for a break.4
It is estimated that one in three women over the age of 50 will experience an osteoporotic fracture in her remaining lifetime.5,6 Patients who experience an osteoporosis-related fracture are twice as likely to experience a future fracture.7
The World Health Organization has officially declared osteoporosis a public health crisis,1 and the International Osteoporosis Foundation urges governments worldwide to make osteoporosis a healthcare priority.8

Amgen Forward-Looking Statements
This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed, and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products after they are on the market.
Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies we have acquired may not be successful. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data security. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock.
The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates.

The U.S. Trade Representative proposed a list of European Union products late on Monday on which to slap tariffs in retaliation to more than $11 billion of EU subsidies to Airbus the World Trade Organisation has found cause "adverse effects" to the United States.
Piling on the uncertainty, the IMF on Tuesday cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2019, citing a potentially disorderly British exit from the European Union as a key risk.
"It\'s been long accepted that while Europe hasn\'t been strongly targeted yet, it was going to be the case once China wrapped up, and Europe would be next," said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA in London.
The pan-region STOXX 600 index fell 0.3 percent, slipping away from an about eight month-peak seen earlier in the day. Germany\'s trade-sensitive DAX dropped 0.9 percent.
Airbus slid 1.6 percent after the United States included large commercial aircraft and parts on its proposed tariff list of EU products. The European planemaker said it saw no legal basis for the move.
"It\'s only natural that Airbus will be among those targets, because its such an important firm for Europe," said Oanda\'s Erlam, adding,"I think the timing of it probably is not too coincidental, given the fact there has been so much tension on Boeing."
Airbus\'s stock has broadly benefited from issues plaguing rival Boeing Co\'s after an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX plane crash spurred a production cut by the U.S. company.
Suppliers to Airbus such as Safran SA, Leonardo and Rolls-Royce Holdings shed between 1.3 percent and 2.1 percent on the day.
Safran\'s stock has been hit in recent weeks, as the French firm has been swept up in the turmoil around Boeing Co, to whom a Safran-General Electric Co joint venture supplies engines.
Premier Li Keqiang of China, the United States\' long-time trade enemy, promised his European Union hosts Beijing will no longer force foreign firms to share sensitive know-how when operating in China and was ready to address industrial subsidies.
European technology stocks had a particularly bruising day, falling 1.5 percent in their worst session in two and a half weeks.
SAP led losses on the sector index with a 3.4 percent slide after it was downgraded by UBS and HSBC. The stock fell for a fourth straight day.
Oil and gas stocks slipped 0.8 percent, after hitting a near six-month peak earlier on Tuesday. Global oil benchmark Brent fell on Russian comments signalling the possible easing of a supply-cutting deal with OPEC. [O/R]
Bank stocks edged up 0.1 percent, rising for the first time in three sessions to help restrain the broad benchmark from incurring a steeper loss.
The European Central Bank is expected to hold borrowing costs on Wednesday, the same day British Prime Minister Theresa May\'s request to delay Brexit until June 30 will be formally discussed by EU leaders at a special summit.
Swiss drugmaker Novartis ended 2 percent lower after completing the spin off of its eyecare unit Alcon, whose stock jumped about 40.2 percent.
Merck KGaA slid 2.6 percent after winning the backing of Versum\'s board for a sweetened $6.5 billion takeover bid, overturning Versum\'s agreed merger with Entegris.
Helsinki-listed DNA surged 8.6 percent after Norway\'s Telenor agreed to buy a 54 percent stake in the Finnish telecoms firm for 1.5 billion euros. Telenor shares ended 0.8 percent lower.

The European Leveraged Finance Alliance (ELFA), a professional trade
association for investors in the European leveraged finance market,
today published the first instalment of its new ELFA Insights Series,
calling for improvement to key aspects of disclosure provided to
investors by borrowers.
The ELFA Insights Series is designed to provide a platform for investor
members of ELFA to express their views about issues relating to
disclosure, transparency, and market practices. The initiative reflects
ELFA\'s remit to facilitate engagement by its members to the broader
market and the general public.
The first instalment highlights the importance of accessibility,
consistency, and content in financial reporting for borrowers, and urges
investors to proactively engage with companies to push for improvements
in these areas.
"Practices such as burying complex and risky covenant provisions in
dense offering documents, barring discussion of such provisions in
roadshow presentations, keeping periodic financial information behind
password-protected websites, and using nebulous and inconsistent
financial definitions in covenant calculations are inconsistent with,
and ill-suited to, a functioning public market."
The first instalment will be followed by in-depth investigations of each
of these elements over the coming months. The Executive Committee of
ELFA hopes that this series will forge a greater understanding of the
implications of poor market practices and propose what can be done to
change them for the better functioning of the European high yield market.
The first instalment of the ELFA Insights Series is available for
download on our website at https://elfainvestors.com/elfa-insights-series.
ABOUT ELFA:

investors that seeks to create a more transparent, efficient, and
resilient leveraged finance market while acting as the voice of its

45,000 inhabitants of Kyzyl Kiya municipality to receive access to safe drinking water
€6 million financing from EBRD, EIB and EU to support water supply in Kyrgyz Republic
Project to cut water losses by 40 per cent
The city of Kyzyl-Kiya, with a population of over 45,000 people in the Batken oblast of the Kyrgyz Republic, will have regular access to safe drinking water thanks to financing from the EBRD, the European Union (EU) and the European Investment Bank (EIB).
A financing package of €6 million - which consists of a €1.5 million EBRD loan, a €1 million EIB loan and €3.5 million EU grant - will help Kyzyl-Kiya Water Company, the municipal water utility, to upgrade its water treatment plant, procure operational and maintenance vehicles and modernise the water supply network and water meters.
The vehicles were presented to the city authorities today during a ceremony attended by Ermekbai Topchubaev, Kyzyl-Kia Mayor, Abdillaziz Satybaldiev, Kyzyl-Kia Water Company Director, Eduard Auer, European Union Ambassador to the Kyrgyz Republic, and Talay Asylbekov, EBRD Associate Director for Infrastructure in Eurasia.
The project improves access to clean water, reduces water losses, strengthens resilience to climate change and optimises Kyzyl-Kiya Water Company\'s operating costs.
Almost 60 per cent of people in Kyzyl Kiya live in private houses with no in-house water supply system and only about 30 per cent of households are connected to the sewerage network, while the rest of the population is still using septic tanks.
The project will benefit from technical assistance provided by the governments of Austria and Japan.
To date, the EBRD has invested over US$ 825 million in the economy of the Kyrgyz Republic, with a majority of investments supporting private entrepreneurship. Over €153 million has been invested in 19 water projects across the country.


At 0920 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.35 percent, having risen more than 3 percent in the past four sessions on hopes that a U.S.-China trade deal could be imminent after both sides reported progress.
Most major bourses in the region were in the red; only Spain eked out gains.
Commerzbank shares rose about 3 percent as the race to acquire the German lender heated up. Two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that UniCredit could explore a merger with Commerzbank if talks with Deutsche Bank fall through.
But they said UniCredit would not crash the Commerzbank-Deutsche talks, and UniCredit\'s focus for now was on its turnaround plan.
The news could rekindle expectations of further consolidation in the battered European banking sector, which has underperformed the STOXX 600 this year.
"UniCredit is probably the best acquirer for a bank like Commerzbank because it has a good restructuring track record in Germany," KBW analysts wrote in a note.
"But in theory it could be complicated, particularly from the capital point of view."
Dampening sentiment was data out of Germany that showed an unexpected drop in industrial orders in February, hit by a slump in foreign demand. Germany\'s leading economic institutes also cut their forecasts for 2019 growth by more than half on Thursday.
Losses in heavyweight BP and Shell weighed down the oil and gas sector, while basic resources stocks slipped after seven straight sessions of gains.
Sharp falls in financial stocks Lloyds, Direct Line and St James\'s Place, which traded ex-dividend, also weighed down Britain\'s FTSE 100 .
The exporter-heavy index also continued to be pressured by a rise in sterling, boosted by hopes of progress or at least a longer Brexit delay as Prime Minister Theresa May seeks a joint approach with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to end a parliamentary deadlock.
Saga Plc shares crashed nearly 30 percent, on course for their worst daily performance, after the over-50s tourism and insurance firm forecast lower annual underlying pretax profit and cut its dividend as it struggles to keep up in a competitive motor and home insurance sector.
Steel maker Thyssenkrupp fell nearly 3 percent as workers demanded substantial guarantees for jobs and plants even if a planned joint venture with India\'s Tata Steel falls apart.
The French supermarket chain Casino fell about 5 percent, hit by a Morgan Stanley downgrade, a day after Moody\'s cut its credit rating on growing concerns about the firm\'s debt.
Among bright spots, UDG Healthcare led gains on the STOXX 600 and the UK\'s midcap index after Barclays upgraded the stock to "overweight" from "equal weight".
Shares in British home repairs provider HomeServe Plc also advanced after forecasting full-year adjusted pretax profit at the upper end of market expectations.

As EU law stands at present, direct taxation falls essentially within the competence of Member States. There is no EU legislation which determines in which State a taxpayer will be taxed if he has tax links to more than one Member State. In areas where no EU secondary legislation is applicable as in the case raised by the petitioner, Member States have the
The petitioner complains about the tax agreement concluded between France and Portugal for the avoidance of double taxation. According to this agreement, income derived from the retirement pension is taxable by the State of the individual\'s residence. Although the petitioner resides in Portugal, he has worked and payed his social security contributions in France for the last forty years. Therefore, the petitioner perceives the application of the Portuguese tax law to his income as unfair and illogical.
competence to design their own tax systems and their tax treaties with due respect to their obligations under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Thus they are not allowed to discriminate in their tax laws on the basis of nationality or residence against the nationals of any Member State, including their own, or against anyone who exercises the freedoms granted under the TFEU.
Thus, the taxation of a Portuguese tax resident on the pension received from the French Social Security is an issue that is not addressed by EU legislation and has to be decided on the basis of the bilateral tax treaty between France and Portugal. According to the treaty between France and Portugal for the elimination of double taxation on income and on capital of 14 January 1971, article 19, pensions are taxed in the State of residence of the taxpayer.
The bilateral decision to tax pensions in the State of tax residence is not as such contrary to EU law: there is not any harmonized law on this subject and this tax regime does not entail a violation of the TFEU. In fact, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) model on tax treaties proposes as a solution for the taxation of pensions that they are taxed in the State of residence of the recipient. This solution guarantees avoiding any double taxation.
Conclusion
The Commission does not have any competence on the decision on how to tax pensioners in Portugal receiving pensions from France. The solution provided for in the relevant tax treaty between France and Portugal does not violate EU Law and guarantees that double taxation does not arise.

The IMF warned that growth could slow further due to trade tensions and a potentially disorderly British exit from the European Union. China, Germany and other major economies might need to take short-term actions to prop up growth, the IMF said.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers the Trump administration is preparing for the possibility of a "hard Brexit."
Asian shares rose to an eight-month high overnight but U.S. and European markets fell after President Donald Trump welcomed the World Trade Organization\'s finding that Europe\'s subsidies to planemaker Airbus had hurt the United States.
The U.S. Trade Representative on Monday proposed a range of EU products, from large commercial aircraft and parts to dairy products and wine, to target as retaliation for subsidies given to Airbus.
Equities fell in Europe and on Wall Street, poised to snap an eight-day rally for the S&P 500, after an EU official said the European trade bloc was beginning preparations to retaliate over Boeing subsidies.
Uncertainty over tariffs and trade between the United States and China have dented business confidence and led corporate investment to dry up, said Hank Smith, co-chief investment officer at The Haverford Trust Co in Radnor, Pennsylvania.
"Business investment is now being put on hold because of the uncertainty around tariffs," he said.
A weak U.S.-China trade deal probably is priced into the market, but a very good trade deal is not, Smith said.
"Even if it\'s not so good, it is going to have a positive effect on the economy because it is going to remove an uncertainty," he said.
MSCI\'s all-country world index, a gauge of stock performance in 47 countries, fell 0.37%. The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.47% and the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares fell 0.41%.
Airbus said it saw no legal basis for the U.S. move toward imposing tariffs on its aircraft and warned of deepening trade tensions.
Shares in Airbus fell 1.86% and many of its key suppliers lost between 0.7% and 1.2%. Boeing shares fell 1.5% ahead of its aircraft delivery and order numbers for March.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 207.09 points, or 0.79%, to 26,133.93. The S&P 500 lost 18.79 points, or 0.65%, to 2,876.98 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 38.62 points, or 0.49%, to 7,915.26.
The yen rose as traders favored the safe-haven currency in the wake of the U.S. proposal for tariffs on European goods.
The dollar index fell 0.04%, with the euro up 0.05% to $1.1265. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.35% versus the greenback at 111.11 per dollar.
U.S. Treasury yields slid, pressured by concerns about the IMF\'s global economic outlook for 2019 as well as a round of headlines on Britain\'s messy departure from the EU.
In Europe, government borrowing costs in southern countries hit fresh lows, pushed down by hopes that this week\'s European Central Bank meeting will reinforce expectations for supportive policy measures in the months ahead.
Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes rose 6/32 in price to push yields down to 2.4953%.
Oil fell from a five-month high above $71 a barrel after Russia signaled a possible easing of a supply-cutting deal with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Brent, the global benchmark, rose to $71.34 a barrel, the highest since November, but later settled down 49 cents at $70.61 per barrel. U.S. crude also hit a November high of $64.79, but settled down 42 cents at $63.98.
Gold rose to its highest in more than a week as the dollar and equities weakened.
U.S. gold futures settled 0.5% higher at $1,308.3 an ounce.

Asia had eked out a 8-month high overnight but Europe was left flat after the office of the U.S. Trade Representative sent its proposals to the World Trade Organisation, saying the EU had provided $11 billion worth subsidies to Airbus.
The planemaker\' shares dropped as much as 2.5 percent in early deals. Many of its key suppliers lost between 0.7 percent and 1.2 percent, though it could have been worse and most of Europe\'s big bourses clawed back to level.
Aberdeen Standard Investment\'s head of global multi-asset strategy, Andrew Milligan, said: "Signals like this just remind people... that the strategic rivalry between the U.S. and other countries is serious and is not going to go away."
The day\'s other focus was set to be the International Monetary Fund\'s half-yearly forecasts, which are likely to reinforce the message that trade spats are contributing to slowing the global economy.
The Fund is expected to make quite a sizable cut to its growth number and Germany\'s benchmark 10-year bond yield stayed just below zero percent on bets interest rates are set to stay extremely low globally.
In the FX market, Sterling nudged higher as UK Prime Minister Theresa May prepared to meet Germany\'s Angela Merkel and France\'s Emmanuel Macron to ask for another Brexit delay.
The Australian and Canadian dollars and Norwegian crown and Russian rouble also rose as a surge in oil prices to five-month highs lifted most other commodity-linked currencies too.
Brent, the global benchmark, rose as high as $71.34 a barrel, the highest since November, and by 0850 GMT was up 14 cents at $71.24. U.S. WTI crude also hit a November 2018 high of $64.77 and was up 22 cents at $64.62.
Oil prices - up more than 40 percent this year - have jumped on expectations that global supplies will tighten due to fighting in Libya, OPEC-led cuts and U.S. sanctions against Iran and Venezuela.
"Concerns over the potential squeezing of supply in Libya following the escalation of violence there are adding fresh impetus," analysts at JBC Energy wrote.

Live at the unveiling of the trophy were also Formula E driver Lucas di Grassi, who is currently driving for the German team Audi Sport ABT Schaeffler, and Formula E Sporting Director Frederic Espinos. \'The introduction of the \'voestalpine European Races\' is an indication of the importance of Formula E to the development of new technologies for e-mobility specifically in Europe,\' says di Grassi. \'For us drivers, this is an additional challenge, but also an incentive to win this prestigious trophy alongside the overall Championship. The specially produced trophy is unique and truly an additional motivation,\' adds di Grassi, who was Formula E Champion in the 2016/2017 season and with 29 podium positions in Formula E is one of the most successful drivers.
Frederic Espinos, Sporting Director of Formula E, is also excited about the upcoming European races: \'Formula E is an ideal platform for the development of technological innovations in e-mobility,\' he comments. \'The partnership with voestalpine and this special prize is also in itself an innovation and unique to the ABB FIA Formula E Championship. I\'m very much looking forward to seeing who will be the first to be entered on the list of best drivers of the \'voestalpine European Races\' and who will lift the voestalpine trophy in Bern,\' he says.
In addition to today\'s unveiling event, on Easter Monday (April 22) Vienna will also be the venue for a further Formula E highlight: a special show run in which the Ringstrasse and the Rathausplatz will be used as an exciting racetrack for the current FIA Formula E Gen2 car. This will be the first time that a Formula E car will race on Vienna\'s streets.

Treasury yields fell Wednesday, along with rates for European counterparts, after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi reiterated his downbeat view of the eurozone\'s growth outlook, and a key inflation reading came in line with expectations.
The 10-year Treasury note yield fell 1.8 basis points to 2.479%. The 2-year note yield fell 1.6 basis points to 2.327%, while the 30-year bond yield was down 0.5 basis point to 2.905%. Bond prices move inversely to yields.
The 10-year German government bond yield retreated 2 basis points to negative 0.03%. German rates can often play a sizable influence in the direction of the U.S. Treasurys market, as investors see both as comparable haven assets, though the relative gap in U.S. and European interest rates has contributed to a divergence between U.S. and German yields.
The European Central Bank made no changes to its policy measures at its March meeting . The central bank repeated it would keep rates at their current level at least through the end of the year. Draghi said the balance of risks to the eurozone economy "remain tilted to the downside."
"For now, the dovish meeting will probably lead to a flatter yield curve as the market hunts for yield," Tim Magnusson, senior portfolio manager at Garda Capital Partners, told MarketWatch.
With much of the German government bond market now sporting negative yields, with the exception of its 30-year maturity, European investors would push into longer-dated debt in search for income-producing securities, he said. Longer maturity bonds tend to offer extra yield compensation to investors.
Draghi also insisted the central bank had plenty of policy measures to deploy if inflation struggled to meet the ECB\'s target of 2%, and said the central bank would issue more details on TLTRO - a program to extend cheap loans to beleaguered banks--in coming meetings.
"The TLTRO program is a way to prove they\'re not out of tools," said Magnusson.
Separately, t he Federal Reserve\'s minutes from its March meeting showe d the central bank\'s decision to pause its rate increase cycle this year came from concerns around the U.S. and global economy\'s health and the lack of inflation pressures. Still, the minutes showed several members of the Fed\'s interest-rate setting committee still saw the possibility of a rate increase this year, once low unemployment rates drive a rebound in consumer spending and growth.
But on late Tuesday, Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said the labor market may have more slack than thought , suggesting the jobless rate hasn\'t fallen below the so-called "full employment" level. Analysts say if the unemployment rate slips below this theoretical level, inflation pressures will start to materialize as tight labor markets spark wage increases.
In economic data, consumer prices for March rose 0.4% , in line with economists\' expectations. The core gauge stripping out for volatile food and energy prices, however, rose only 0.1%. Rising inflation can erode a bond\'s fixed value over time.
"In the near term, we don\'t have an inflation problem. The data supports the Fed being in pause mode, and it reinforces monetary policy as it stands now," Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist for Schwab Center for Financial Research, said in an interview with MarketWatch.

This informative event provides an opportunity for customers and operators from around the world to learn about Bombardier\'s latest in-service activities, world-class products and program development updates.
With the recent introduction of a dedicated Challenger 300 Mobile Response Team (MRT) aircraft based in Frankfurt, Germany, and a new line maintenance station in Paris, Bombardier continues to enhance its customer service footprint in Europe.
\'We are committed to ensuring our customers receive an exceptional experience, so we are not only expanding our worldwide support network and adding value throughout their aircraft\'s lifecycle, but also highlighting our industry-leading products such as our flagship Global 7500 aircraft,\' said Jean-Christophe Gallagher, Vice President and General Manager of Customer Experience, Bombardier Business Aircraft.
This year\'s event features several new sessions, giving guests a unique opportunity to learn more about Bombardier\'s products and services, including updates on the Global 7500 aircraft and our award-winning service centres.

Bombardier\'s industry-defining Global 7500 aircraft will be a prominent part of this year\'s event, with general sessions highlighting the most luxurious and impressive business aircraft ever built. Since its entry-into-service in Dec. 2018, the Global 7500 jet has emphatically proven itself to be the highest-performing aircraft in the history of business aviation. Its recent record-setting non-stop flight of 8,152 nautical miles connecting Singapore to Tucson, Az., is the longest-range business aircraft flight and showcases the real-world capabilities of this aircraft.
The M&O Conference Europe is just one of several customer-focused events Bombardier has planned for 2019. A full roster of events is in the works, including exhibitions, six customer advisories and Safety Standdown 2019 in Fort Worth, Tx.

This year\'s Safety Standdown seminar will be held on Nov. 12-14 at the OMNI Fort Worth hotel in Fort Worth, Tx.
\'These important events give our customers and operators an invaluable forum to share key information about our products and services so we can deliver exceptional products and unparalleled service to our customers,\' added Gallagher. \'It\'s just one more way we can continue to provide the best customer experience possible.\'

The Paris Climate Agreement (COP21) as ratified by the Union on 5 October 20163 and entered into force on 4 November 2016, seeks to strengthen the response to climate change, among other means, by making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.
(1a) Incorporating environmental, social and governance factors in the investment decision making process, can realise benefits beyond the financial markets. It is therefore key that financial market participants provide the necessary information to enable comparability of investments and informed investment decisions. Furthermore, to fulfil the obligations of due diligence concerning the sustainability impact and risks and to provide meaningful information to end-investors, financial market participants need reliable, comparable and harmonised disclosure of information by investee companies. This process can only succeed where legally agreed definitions are put in place.


The Dilemma Behind Daylight Saving Time In Europe
FreightWaves 4/2/2019 9:06:16 AM
In a landmark move, the European Parliament voted by more than a two-thirds majority in favor of the decision to end daylight saving time (DST). Once the decision to stop the changeover was established, the Transport Committee followed it up by voting on when to end DST, with the members concurring that it would occur in the autumn of 2021.
Though this is an important step in the legislative process towards regularizing time zones and abolishing DST, the final decision on how it will be implemented will materialize only when there is an agreement between the European Union (EU) transport ministers and the European Parliament. This would be an ongoing negotiation and is not expected to conclude before autumn 2019.
Though the EU transport ministers and the European Parliament look like they require similar regulations, the problem is with the timeline of enforcing the end of DST. In a poll that spanned the EU on the need for DST, people overwhelmingly voted against the half-yearly change in summer and winter time, with 84 percent asking for its abolishment. This put pressure on the European Commission to end it as soon as possible, but the resistance it has received from the various EU transport ministries has delayed the inevitable.
From the point of view of the transport ministries, a change in time would lead them to work out the implications it will have on transportation networks, especially since most of the countries within Europe have open borders with their neighbors. Apart from the obvious issues that will arise with air traffic flow, transport ministries need to contend with time difference hassles across several border train stations and international highways, with ministries arguing that coordinating these networks would take quite some time.
DST in Europe - just like in other parts of the world - is tied to historical situations like World War II or the 1970s oil crisis. During World War II, governments adopted time-related changes to make sure that they conserved energy by fitting work days to the available sunlight hours. Though several European countries phased out DST after the war, it was brought back during the oil crisis which hit Europe far harder than it did North America.
But now, the need for DST is thought outdated by many because countries\' are more energy- independent and alternative fuel sources are available. That apart, artificial lighting uses much less electricity now, with LED lights generally consuming around 75 percent less energy than traditional incandescent light bulbs.
The European Commission has stated that countries can decide on which time zone they would like to fall under. Unlike the reasonably simple time zone divisions in the U.S., the European situation is more difficult because several countries extend across different time zones yet fall under another for no apparent reason. For instance, though the U.K. and Spain quite completely fall under the Western European time zone, Spain has adopted the Central European time zone, making it an hour ahead of the U.K.
This has created problems for the Spanish people, with their days stretching much longer than desired and has led to the Spanish dining and sleeping very late in the night and waking up late - taking a toll on the country\'s overall productivity.
Similarly, in eastern Europe, Russia and Belarus are an hour ahead of the rest of the countries that fall under the same line, creating chaos for people crossing borders. For example, for people driving from Lithuania to Ukraine, they pass through Belarus and have to change their clocks twice on the way, even though Lithuania and Ukraine fall under the same time zone.
DST and incoherent time zone divisions have caused misery for many in Europe, and it is no wonder that people are overwhelmingly in support of abolishing it and redrawing the time zone maps to make it more even across the continent. The bulk of that work falls on the transport ministries; they will have to coordinate with their counterparts and decide on demarcations that hopefully will make life simpler, while also effectively utilizing the available sunlight hours.

Thank you for hosting me again at your great Institute.
I am here to discuss with you the EU-US cooperation in the wake of a tech revolution. On both sides of the Pond we face similar problems and have a similar challenge to find the right answers.
Digitalisation has changed our lives beyond recognition; it has revolutionised the way we work and travel, the way we learn about things. It offers no doubt many opportunities for society and for economic innovation.
But recently, we have become acutely aware of the challenges that digitalisation and technology can pose to the rule of law, democracy and fairness. Regularly we see shocking revelations, whether in relation to Cambridge Analytica, foreign meddling in elections or security gaps in critical infrastructure like 5G. And I see that more and more politicians in the U.S. are starting to ask difficult questions: are the tech giants too big to handle, should they be broken up, are our competition rules up to speed with today\'s reality, do we have tools to protect our privacy?
I came to the US to share a European view on some of these issues, but also with a strong call to our American allies that it is time to shift up the gear, to work together and to become global rule maker, rather than wait on the sidelines and become a rule taker.
Before I elaborate briefly on these points, I wanted to share two small personal remarks, because they will help you to understand what drives my actions.
First, a small confession. I wouldn\'t describe myself as a coder. And I even deleted my Facebook account a few years ago because I felt it had become a place for hatred.
I am a sociologist and a lawyer by training and this background is shaping my views and my actions on the tech revolution in general, and on the Internet in particular.
As a sociologist I am mindful of the effects digitalization and social media have on our society.
As a lawyer and EU Justice Commissioner, I am focusing on equality before the law and legal protection of the people and our values. My mantra is what is illegal offline should be illegal online.
And the second thing I wanted to tell you is that I don\'t have a knee-jerk reaction that regulation is the best way to solve all the problems. I am a fan of a more light-touch approach.
To me the main question is not to break up Facebook or not. The big question is how we can maintain our values and export them to the new digital age.
Let\'s start with Europe\'s response.
Values
First, despite all the changes, I think we want to maintain who we are. Modern Europe, like the United States, has been built on a solid foundation of democracy, freedom, fairness and the rule of law.
Digital or not - for values this should not matter. Technology is a means to an end, not an end itself. It should serve the people.
Yet, many of the tech champions were labelled as the disruptors, sometimes disregarding even those core values.
The only long-term solution I see is for a democratic society to reassert control of this process and put people at the centre of the technological revolution.
In Europe, we wanted to create a regulatory floor to help people gain more control and to make choices.
GDPR
The key element of this regulatory floor is our new data protection legislation, the GDPR.
Now, the GDPR is almost one year old and the first conclusions are that it is working well. We are starting to see positive trends when it comes to innovation and data security or when it comes to citizens making use of their new rights, for instance data portability.
This was not a foregone conclusion as I still recall the first reactions, many of them from the U.S., that privacy is a European obsession, that in the age of social media privacy is obsolete. Today we hear from those social media that they would welcome a GDPR standard globally, and that they want even more regulation. What a difference a few years can make.
Here is why I think GDPR works. The GDPR is based on simple principles: it is a \'federal\' law with a core set of rights and is enforced by independent authorities. The advantage of this approach is that it creates the same rules for businesses in the biggest single market of 500 million consumers. Hence, it offers an easy way to move data between each other.
Despite criticism, none of the then \'doom and gloom\' scenarios have materialised. Companies report that it was an opportunity to put their house in order when it comes to the data they hold, and increase its security. It also helps them develop more trustworthy relationships with their customers and offer innovative, more privacy-friendly services.
Online content and responsibility of platforms
But legislation is not the only thing we do. When it comes to online content, we wanted to preserve the broad freedom for platforms to operate, but we also wanted them to start fixing the problems, they themselves helped to create.
We adapted our response to different types of content. The bigger the potential harm for the people, the faster and stronger the reaction should be. Terrorist content and child sexual abuse images are the biggest threats. On terrorist content we proposed legislation.
Then, for illegal hate speech that is banned in all Member States by European law, I worked with platforms on the voluntary Code of Conduct to ensure that the rules that apply offline are also respected online. And we achieved good results quickly.
On disinformation, we take a more nuanced approach. In self-regulation we focus on transparency. In parallel we create networks of fact checkers and systems to be able to detect massive fake news campaign fast and to react, And more long term, we invest in media literacy in education and in support for independent quality journalism.
Artificial Intelligence
When it comes to Artifical Intelligence, we want to support it, but ensure that it benefits people and eliminate bias. That\'s why just earlier this week we have proposed an ethical human-centred approach to AI. We have to find a way that AI as a technology will be a force of good rather than multiply bias.
Elections
Learning from the case of the US elections but also in Europe, we are also now working with platforms on a voluntary basis to inject more transparency to election campaigns online. They cannot be a black hole with no information on who stands behind an ad and who paid for it. Debate in a true democracy is transparent. And this must include political advertising in social media. Otherwise, we become vulnerable for possible manipulation, including by foreign actors.
Next steps
Today, the US and the EU are facing similar challenges. It would make our response much stronger if we came up with similar solutions.
To simplify, today I see two camps, globally: a people-friendly camp that understands that we should have more control over our data including in the online environment. A camp that shares the view that all players, including governments, have to respect limitations when it comes to the processing of personal data and be transparent. Europe is a proud member of this club because it is based on our values; on who we are.
And there is the other camp that has a lax approach to privacy, prioritizes uninhibited and uncontrolled access to data in the name of business or government interests.
I would want the US to join us in the first camp and to build on our successful privacy work, for instance in the Privacy Shield. It\'s time to work together , also with Japan and others like minded allies, on setting the global standard and leading the way. I believe this is the right moment to build a global coalition and promote secure flow of data and people-friendly tech, based on trust and respect of strong privacy rules.
This could create a strong transatlantic regulatory floor that could become a part of the answers to burning questions about 5G infrastructure, China or the power of data hungry tech giants.
Europe will be going through a political transition this year, starting with the European Parliament elections and then, towards the end of this year, with a new European Commission with new ideas. And I am sure that the response to tech challenges will be high on the agenda.
Let me share with you six ideas that I think the next European Commission should focus on.
First of all, we should continue to follow \'the people first\' approach.
Second - we should focus on independent ethical evaluation on the impact of the tech innovation on the people and our lives. We should not aspire to become the next episode of the Black Mirror TV show.
Third, we should think how to implement the \'values by design\' approach by companies. This would mean for example ensuring that programmers think from the start of building algorithms about how this could affect our fundamental rights.
Fourth, we should not be afraid to have a serious discussion about accountability in the online environment.
Fifth - resist temptation of over-regulation. Rather we should look into adopting the existing rules on for example, product safety, data, discrimination or cars to take into account new developments, e.g. in AI.
Sixth - we have to find a way to allow start-ups to innovate and to grow. Help them to find the smart money. We could think of lessons we learn from the fintech industry and think of regulatory sandbox for start-ups.
Conclusion
The way we shape our societal and political response to tech revolution will influence the next generations. I want to see Europe and America working together because we are democratic societies built on similar values, and we are exposed to similar problems.
And if we manage to arrive to convergent solutions, our voice would be heard around the world and we would be in the lead of shaping global solutions.
But, if we will become rivals and promote conflicting models, none of us will win. We will both lose out to others.
So, it\'s decision time and I trust that Europe will be a good partner and also serve as an inspiration for the current US debate.

These factors weighed on market sentiment, spurring selling on Wall Street and touching off a partial reversal of earlier gains in oil prices. The pull back in crude and other commodity prices cut into the initial gains of the Canadian and Australian dollar as well as emerging currencies.

While the IMF reduced its calls on expansion for both Europe and the United States, the euro clung to its modest gains versus the dollar, last up 0.05% at $1.12655.
"Lots of negativity is already baked into the euro. Today\'s developments, while not encouraging, didn\'t meaningfully add to the bloc\'s weak narrative," Manimbo said.

By Emre Peker
BRUSSELS -- The European Union agreed to launch talks for a trade pact with the U.S., seeking to preserve a truce with President Trump despite competing demands over agriculture.
EU governments directed on Thursday the bloc\'s executive and sole trade authority, the European Commission, to focus on slashing tariffs on industrial goods, explicitly excluding agriculture. Two days earlier, the U.S. envoy to the EU said agriculture must be included for negotiations to move ahead.
Despite the brewing clash over U.S. demands that Europe open its food markets, the EU agreement over negotiating guidelines comes at a critical time. U.S. officials have been cautioning that their patience is wearing thin, and Mr. Trump is considering tariffs on U.S. car imports, which would hit $60 billion in European exports.
"We have made little progress," Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the EU, told a group of EU lawmakers on Tuesday. "The more the EU leadership plays the delay game, the more the resentment grows in Washington."
EU officials said Brussels wants to show it is ready to deliver on the July 2018 deal between Mr. Trump and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. The leaders agreed to halt a trade fight, pledging in a joint statement to reduce tariffs and cut red tape. They promised a non-auto industrial-goods agreement, and both sides said they want quick results.
EU officials, however, haggled for months to get consensus among the bloc\'s 28 members to start trade-deal negotiations. Parallel efforts to get regulatory agreements haven\'t yet finalized.
Meanwhile, the U.S. trade deficit with the EU widened last year to EUR139.7 billion ($157.3 billion), fueling Mr. Trump\'s complaint that the trans-Atlantic relationship is unfair. Adding to European urgency has been the mid-May deadline facing the president on vehicle and auto-parts tariffs.
"We are working loyally to implement all aspects of the July 2018 statement," commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said Thursday. "We\'re engaging, we\'re talking."
The U.S. is also inching toward a trade deal with China, which is adding to pressure on the EU as it grapples with domestic pushback.
Some European leaders, wary of an antitrade backlash ahead of European Parliament elections in May, have been reluctant to approve negotiations with the U.S.
France has been particularly concerned that U.S. talks could energize populist, anti-EU parties seeking to capitalize on fears that a deal with Washington would erode European standards.
Topping EU worries is food safety, especially over U.S. practices including hormone-treated beef and chicken washed with chlorinated water to kill bacteria.
"If Mr. Trump wants to make us import chlorinated chicken or meat with antibiotics or hormones, our answer is no," said Nathalie Loiseau, French President Emmanuel Macron\'s lead candidate in the EU elections.
Paris delayed agreement on the negotiating mandate last week. France allowed on Thursday the measure to advance for formal adoption, only to say afterward that it would vote against U.S. trade talks, despite EU reassurances to exclude agriculture.
Honoring French requests, EU governments also said negotiating directives for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership must be considered obsolete. The clause is meant to quash speculation about the resurrection of controversial TTIP negotiations during the Obama administration. Those talks collapsed, partially over agriculture.
EU governments are expected to formally approve the mandate for U.S. trade talks on Monday, despite France\'s symbolic vote against. That would pave the way for the commission to start negotiations with the U.S. trade representative.
"We showed a lot of flexibility to accommodate the French because we wanted this adopted" before Mr. Trump has to decide on car tariffs, an EU diplomat said. "We were willing to accept anything to get this done."

ECHA/NR/19/16
ECHA continues to recommend companies to prepare for the UK withdrawal without a transition period, now expected to take effect on 13 April 2019, at 00:00 hours CET (i.e. 12 April 2019, 11 p.m. UK time).
Helsinki, 3 April 2019 - Companies are reminded to initiate the transfer of their registrations and other assets through ECHA\'s IT tools before the UK withdrawal takes effect (on 13 April 2019, at 00:00 hours CET), and not to leave these transactions to the last moment.
The number of registrations for which a transfer was initiated from a UK-based registrant to an EU-27 based company is increasing, with the cumulative figure exceeding 4 800 by the end of March out of approximately 12 000 UK registrations in total.
Companies can still benefit from the advice and practical instructions on ECHA\'s website to minimise the impact of the UK\'s withdrawal on their business, concerning REACH, CLP, PIC and the Biocidal Products Regulation.


EBRD-EU report highlights advantages of a pan-Baltic single index classification
Goal is to become a joint regional marketplace for institutional investors
Recommendations include key actions to promote local capital market development
Latvia \'s Ministry of Finance took a landmark step toward the creation of a cohesive pan-Baltic capital market today, with the formal acknowledgement of the key points raised by a new assessment report.
The report, funded by the European Union and implemented by the EBRD in cooperation with the European Commission\'s Structural Reform Support Services (SRSS), underscores the advantages of a single index classification for the region. Similar to the other Baltic states, Latvia is currently rated as a frontier market by several index providers due to its size and limited liquidity. Assets under management directed to frontier markets total USD $75 billion compared to USD $1.5 trillion allocated to emerging markets. A pan-Baltic single index approach would facilitate greater capital inflow and further raise the profile of the region as an investment destination, and potentially trigger an emerging market designation. The recommendations identify several pan-Baltic synergies and initiatives that could lead to a regional classification and underscore key actions the Ministry of Finance can take to promote the development of capital markets in the region. Suggested solutions include encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and private companies to tap debt and equity capital markets to address the limited investment product availability and liquidity, the further integration of the three Baltic markets to better reflect international investors\' interests, and the development of private and public partnership solutions for enhancing access to finance for SMEs in the Baltic region. The success of the Port of Tallinn\'s IPO in Estonia and energy companies in Lithuania have captured investor interest and highlight the need for Latvia to work on its own solutions and policies. A further SOE policy review is expected to be initiated by the Latvian authorities this year under the SRSS and implemented by the EBRD.
Valdis Dombrovskis, European Commission Vice President, explained that today\'s report shows that by connecting their capital markets and developing them together, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia will unleash their full potential for more investment and economic growth. \'This cooperation sends a clear message to global investors that the Baltics are open for investment. Local and regional capital markets are the foundation of the EU Capital Markets Union. The Commission will continue to strongly support cross-border initiatives such as these in the Baltic region,\' he said.
Pierre Heilbronn, EBRD Vice President, Policy & Partnerships, said that the initiative shows how smaller jurisdictions can enhance their domestic capital markets through an integrated approach. He noted, \'All Baltic governments, together with the European Commission, EBRD and Nasdaq, have expressed their interest in arriving at a single pan-Baltic classification by leading index providers,\' and welcomed MSCI\'s recent statement that a single market classification may be possible for the Baltics.
Jānis Reirs, the Minister of Finance for Latvia, stressed the importance of regional cooperation in overcoming the constraints each countries face due to their limited size. He added, \'Functioning capital markets are crucial for the economy as they diversify the enterprises\' financing sources, enable us to grow, fund expansion and create new jobs. The ongoing cooperation among the Baltic states proves that with joint efforts it is possible to continue successfully the development of capital markets in the region, attracting more attention of foreign investors.\'
The joint pan-Baltic initiative was launched in 2017 with the goal of harmonising regulations and dismantling investment barriers to attract foreign investment.
The EBRD has been working in the Baltic states since 1991 and has invested over €2.2 billion in 258 projects in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Strengthening private enterprises and developing the capital market are among the Bank\'s priorities in these countries.


White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Tuesday said "more headway" is expected to be made in U.S.-China trade talks this week, while U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May met opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn on Wednesday, seeking a way out of a Brexit stalemate.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1 percent to its highest level in nearly eight months, aided by gains on bourses across the continent.
Positive sentiment was supplemented by data showing retail sales in the Euro zone were stronger than expected in February, while activity in China\'s services sector hit a 14-month high in March.
"Clearly the market is in a more positive mood," said Elwin de Groot, head of macro strategy at Rabobank.
"At least for the coming months, we are going to see a pickup in growth certainly in the Euro area."
Germany\'s DAX rose for a fifth straight session. The trade-sensitive index added 1.7 percent on Wednesday in its best performance in more than half a month.
London\'s FTSE 100 rose 0.4 percent, but did not match advances seen on most European bourses as a firmer pound capped gains. The profits of a significant number of the benchmark\'s firms are dented by a stronger pound due to the companies\' reliance on overseas earnings.
The positive sentiment crossed the Irish Sea, with Dublin-traded stocks rising 1.8 percent to their highest closing level in nearly half a year. Ireland is especially exposed to the fall-out from a hard Brexit.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would fight until the very end for an orderly Brexit and use her upcoming visit to Ireland to consider the border situation and solutions that could prevent a hard Brexit.
Shares of European chemical firms gained about 2.1 percent, while financials services stocks added 1.9 percent largely on gains made by London-traded stocks.
Construction and materials stocks also basked in the glow of a potentially softer Brexit, tacking on 1.8 percent.
CRH PLC led the sector\'s gains with a 3.5 percent rise. The Irish stock also benefited from Berenberg starting coverage with a "Buy" rating and a price target of 33 euros.
European chipmakers Ams, Siltronic and Infineon Technologies each rose at least 4.1 percent, gaining along witht their U.S. peers, bolstered by optimism over U.S.-China trade talks.
Healthcare stocks limited the broader benchmark\'s gains as they dropped 0.4 percent. Danish bioscience firm Chr Hansen Holding A/S fell 6.8 percent to lead losses on the sector index after its second quarter results failed to impress investors.
Basic resources stocks ended at their highest closing level in more than eight and a half months, gaining for a seventh straight session.
Stocks of auto firms and parts suppliers rose 1.4 percent, making for a fourth straight winning session.
Among individual stocks, Germany\'s Prosiebensat 1 Media climbed 5.6 percent, with the chairman of Mediaset saying the Italian broadcaster was still studying a possible cross-border deal.
Mediaset ended the day up 3.1 percent.
Luxury goods maker Burberry Group slid 2 percent after JP Morgan analysts cut their full-year profit forecast, citing high exposure to Brexit-related sterling volatility.

WASHINGTON, April 5, 2019 - Economic growth in the Europe and Central Asia region slowed to 3.1% in 2018, and is projected to decline to 2.1% in 2019, amid slowing global growth and uncertain prospects, according to the World Bank\'s Economic Update for Europe and Central Asia, released today.
Growth in countries across the region varied. Upward revisions to GDP data for Russia, the largest economy in the region, contributed strongly to regional growth, alongside accelerating growth in Albania, Hungary, Poland, and Serbia. Meanwhile, Turkey experienced a severe slowdown, triggered by financial market and currency pressures - growth is forecast at 1.0% for 2019, a major decline from 7.4% in 2017.
\'Europe and Central Asia is vulnerable to global uncertainty, and it faces several long-term challenges including aging populations, declining productivity, weakening investment, and climate change. The good news is there are a range of policy options available to boost growth and mitigate these challenges,\' says Cyril Muller, World Bank Vice President for Europe and Central Asia. \'Countries should close investment gaps, improve governance, participate more in global value chains, and ensure more people have access to financial services including bank accounts and digital payments.\'
Regional growth is expected to pick-up modestly in 2020-21, as an anticipated gradual recovery in Turkey offsets moderating activity in Central Europe. However, the region\'s long-term challenges remain formidable.
The share of the working-age population in the region has fallen dramatically, due largely to declining fertility rates in the 1990s. Productivity slowed to 0.8% per year between 2013 and 2017. Investment growth has slowed sharply, from an average above 15% in the five years prior to the global financial crisis to an average of 1.6% in the period 2014-18. And, parts of the region - particularly Central Asia and the Western Balkans - are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as droughts, flooding, and more frequent natural disasters.
The report says financial inclusion can help countries in Europe and Central Asia address these challenges because access to financial services facilitates people\'s investment in their health, education and businesses, thereby promoting development and reducing poverty.
\'Financial inclusion can help boost growth and play an important role in addressing many of the region\'s long-term challenges,\' says Asli Demirgüç-Kunt, World Bank Chief Economist for Europe and Central Asia. \'Account ownership is the first step into the formal financial system, making it easier to get wages, receive money from friends and family, and collect government payments. It also encourages both saving and borrowing. In emerging countries of Europe and Central Asia, the share of the population with an account increased from 45% in 2011 to 65% in 2017, which is a promising trend. But, there is still a long way to go in many countries.\'
In 2017, about 116 million adults in the Europe and Central Asia region had no bank account, the majority living in Russia, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, and Romania. Being unbanked is generally associated with a lack of labor force participation, lower levels of education, and being among the poorest 40% of the population. Lack of trust in financial institutions represents a major concern for people, which is consistent with low levels of formal savings and the prevalence of informal borrowing throughout the region. Gender inequality in account ownership also persists: women represent 58% of all unbanked adults in the region.
To significantly increase the number of bank account holders in the region, the report argues that governments can play a critical role by moving routine payments into bank accounts. Such payments would include public sector workers\' wages, distribution of public pensions, agricultural payments and social benefits transfers to people in need. Advances in digital technology and greater use of mobile phones also present major opportunities for governments to expand financial inclusion, close gender gaps, and boost economic growth in countries across the region.


Georges GAUDRIAULT, Scientific Director of DEINOVE, will give a talk at the ECCMID, at the ‘Therapeutics pipeline corner’, on this coming Sunday, April 14 th , in Amsterdam.
He will describe the progress of the DNV3837 program, including new data and the design of the upcoming Phase II clinical trial in severe gastrointestinal infections caused by Clostridium difficile.
ECCMID is the world\'s premier Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases event.
DEINOVE (Euronext Growth Paris: ALDEI), a French biotech company that uses a disruptive approach to develop innovative antibiotics and bio-based active ingredients, announced that Georges GAUDRIAULT will give a presentation at the 29th Annual Congress of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, from 13 April to 16 April).
He will introduce the DNV3837 antibiotic program at the Therapeutics pipeline corner which will be held on Sunday, April 14th, from 12:15 to 1:15pm. He will highlight new pre-clinical data and will provide information on the upcoming Phase II clinical study.
ECCMID is the world\'s premier Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases event. It brings together experts from many fields to present their latest findings, guidelines and experiences to an audience of over 12,000 colleagues. It will take place in Amsterdam, Netherlands, from 13 - 16 April 2019.
The details of the presentation will be disclosed at the end of the meeting.
ABOUT THE DNV3837 ANTIBIOTIC CANDIDATE
DNV3837 – a prodrug of the DNV3681 molecule (also known as MCB3681) – is a narrow-spectrum, hybrid oxazolidinone-quinolone synthetic antibiotic targeting only Gram-positive bacteria. It is developed as a highly active 1st line treatment targeting Clostridium difficile.
It has demonstrated significant efficacy and superiority to reference treatments (fidaxomicin in particular) against isolates of C. diff., regardless of their virulence (including the hyper virulent strain NAP1) or their resistance to other antibacterial drugs.
DNV3837 is administered intravenously and is able to cross the gastrointestinal barrier, allowing it to precisely target the infection site. Several Phase I trials (on approx. on hundred healthy volunteers) have shown a high concentration of the antibiotic in stools, a strong marker of its presence in the intestine. It has also demonstrated its ability to eliminate C. diff. bacteria without altering the gut microbiota in the long term, a definite advantage for patient prognosis. It has also shown an acceptable tolerance profile.
FDA granted the DNV3837 program with Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation and Fast Track status.
The Phase II study is scheduled to begin mid-2019. It will be a multicenter trial with a major part taking place in the United States. DEINOVE has chosen Medpace as its Clinical Research Organization (CRO)1 to prepare and oversee the trial.

Steel Wood Industries Announces Expansion into Europe after Signing a
LOI with Job Service Spa of Italy; The Engine of Serious Negotiations
Ignites; Unleash the Bull
Steel Wood Industries, SWIdxb, Dubai Ranch, announces the signature of
LOI in April of a multi-million-euro expansion of operations in Italy
with Job Service Spa Italy. Ghassan Afiouni, Managing Partner of Steel
Wood Industries and Mr. Postiglione Luigi CEO of Job Service Spa
forecast to see SWItaly operating on European land. The Technology-based
facility is entering the European Market via Italy to support SWItaly in
efforts to recover millions of tons annually of unusable wood to
generate SDB-Panels. This recovery captures millions of tons of Carbon
Dioxide credits annually, which will turn, once the infrastructure is
set, into a tradable commodity along with the ability to sell the
multi-award winning SDB boards manufactured solely by Steel Wood
Industries for the European market.
Luigi commented, “SWI is not only a business, it’s a model and a vision
that engages in saving the earth from climate change perspective and
allows for more control of tree-trimming by other wood mills. SWI does
not cut trees to manufacture SDB, and in fact, SDB is a recyclable
producing a re-recycled material with properties superior to the
“mother” raw material, wood!”.
“The devil is in the details”, said Afiouni, “however, the two entities
are now engaged in serious negotiations and the strategic planning to
witness manufacturing facilities in Italy. I believe with the goodwill
of both parties and ensured protection of the inhouse technology of SWI,
we can hopefully reach a signed agreement in the near future.” Sixteen
professionals of Job Service SPA visited SWI factory in Dubai for the
LOI purpose, which includes Mr. Fabrizio Savoia (President), Mr. Adriano
Cerocchi and Mr. George Vladimirov.
SWI has received a multitude of awards in 2018 and 2019 in many aspects
for its SWI-stainable model. They call their branches ranches as it’s an
environmental factory that captures thousands of tons annually. The SWI
model can aid many governments worldwide in reaching their carbon
dioxide reduction target enforced by the United Nations through
converting a burden-resource into a valuable-product as well. This
SWI-stainable model engages in climate change, carbon capture,
manufacturing of superior SDB wooden panels and exporting to the world
thus generating an amazing cycle of Sustainability for the countries
engaged.
SWI has also been approached by various parties for other factories
worldwide who are trying to create investment teams not limited to GCC,
Europe, Africa and North America. “Our current site was our experimental
site; Thanks to God the market feedback is amazing as we are now
supplying in the UAE and the GCC Major International Projects and
specified by Major International Consultants. Our range of products
cover FR, HMR, WBP, Acoustic, Low Emissions etc. which can be replace
all wooden application a carpenter and architect can imagine,” said MP
Ghassan Afiouni, “in fact, with a couple factories in Italy, we can
reach 80% of carbon reduction set by the UN in 2050. We still have more
for the market and this is only the beginning.”

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.2 percent by 0907 GMT, led by declines in Milan and Madrid, but Paris rose 0.3 percent.
The European Central Bank stood pat on borrowing rates on Wednesday and said threats to global economic growth remained, while the U.S. Federal Reserve reiterated its patient stance on similar grounds, citing risks from an unresolved trade dispute with China and potentially, Europe.
"At least on (the) part of the ECB, they seem to be slightly less certain on their outlook that (growth) will rebound but they are still hoping this," said Bas van Geffen, a quantitative analyst ECB at Rabobank.
"The question is to what extent are markets going to see this as indeed \'low rates for longer\' and, if so, how concerned are they on the growth cautions."
Ireland\'s ISEQ stock index was flat after the European Union gave British Prime Minister Theresa May until October to leave the bloc, but the lack of clarity on when, how or even if Brexit will happen, kept a lid on gains.
ASML was one of the biggest drags on the pan-region index after a media report said Chinese employees stole corporate secrets from the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker, resulting in hundreds of millions of euros (dollars) in losses. ASML, in response, said that a U.S. software subsidiary was the victim of corporate theft several years ago, but denied that the information stolen was a blueprint for its lithography machines.
German silicon wafer maker Siltronic fell 2.1 percent after Credit Suisse cut its target price for the company by 12 euros.
Material stocks lost 1.2 percent with mining majors BHP and Rio Tinto, tracking a decline in iron ore and copper prices.
Utilities were dragged 1 percent lower, with Engie down 1.8 percent after Morgan Stanley downgraded it to "equal-weight" from "overweight" as it sees headwinds in 2019.
Prysmian shed more than 8.5 percent and was among the biggest percentage decliners on the STOXX 600 as the Italian cable maker said it would review its financial results for last year.
On the other hand, LVMH surged to an all-time high, up 4 percent after sales growth at the luxury goods conglomerate picked up pace in the first quarter.
Other luxury good stocks such as Kering, Christian Dior, Moncler and Burberry also climbed.
Sodexo jumped 5.4 percent after the French food services group reported a stronger-than-expected rise in first-half revenues as growth accelerated in North America during the second quarter.
EssilorLuxottica SA was also among the biggest boosts as Citigroup upgraded shares of the world\'s largest eyewear maker to "neutral".

The regulatory framework for 20201 and 20302 establishes targets aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors. For 2020, the EU is on track to achieve the goal of a
The European Union acknowledges the urgency to take action against climate change and it is committed to remaining a global leader in climate action. In that context, the EU is now one of the first "major economies" to have put in place the necessary legislation to comply with its pledges under the Paris Agreement.
The petitioner objects to what she perceives as a too lax approach by the Union and Member States to combating climate change. She believes that the existing regulatory framework and legislation is not sufficiently stringent to reflect the urgency of the problem, and that therefore new measures ought to be adopted. The petitioner also condemns what she perceives as inadequate monitoring and enforcement of existing legislation. The petition also refers to the disappearance of green spaces and the persisting problem of plastic litter and plastic pollution.
20% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990.
As regards 2030, the EU has already put in place the necessary legislation to achieve its objective of reducing at least 40% of greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels. The sectors covered by the EU emissions trading system (ETS) will have to cut their emissions by 43% compared to 2005, while non-ETS sectors (transport, buildings, agriculture and waste) will need to cut them by 30% compared to 2005.
In addition, in November 2018, the Commission presented its strategic long-term vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate-neutral economy by 2050. The strategy shows how Europe can lead the way to climate neutrality by investing in realistic technological solutions, empowering citizens, and aligning action in key areas such as industrial policy, finance, and research - while ensuring social fairness for a just transition.
Following the invitations by the European Parliament and the European Council, the Commission\'s vision for a climate-neutral future covers nearly all EU policies and is in line with the Paris Agreement objective to keep the global temperature increase to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5°C.
Besides the adoption of legislation, the monitoring and enforcement of EU climate legislation is a priority and the Commission is committed to ensuring its proper application in line with its 2016 Communication "EU Law: Better results through better application"3. Among these actions, infringements, EU Pilots and precise monitoring and reporting requirements are established.
The Commission is closely monitoring the action of Member States to ensure the binding national targets will be met; however, Member States have to implement policies and measures to accomplish their national targets. The EU can only act under the scope of its competences.
Finally, the petition refers to persisting environmental problems such as plastic pollution. In the context of the circular economy, in 2018 the Commission adopted the first-ever Europe- wide strategy on plastics4, which aims at initiating a transition towards more sustainable materials. The strategy sets new rules that will foster recycling methods, curb plastic waste and protect the sea against plastic littering. Furthermore, the Commission will provide guidance and support investment to make recycling processes more efficient and will act internationally to foster global solutions. As a follow up to the Plastics Strategy, the Commission adopted an ambitious legislative proposal on single use plastics and fishing gear that will contribute to fight plastics pollution by addressing around 70% of marine litter in the EU. On 19 December 2018 the co-legislators reached a provisional agreement and this proposal is due to enter into force in 2021.

Experiment launch in Southern Italy: hydrogen is a key technology for decarbonisation and storage of renewable sources
Contursi Terme (Salerno, Italy), 1 April 2019 - Snam today has officially launched its experiment of introducing a 5% hydrogen and natural gas blend into the Italian gas transmission network. The experiment, the first of its kind in Europe, is being conducted in Contursi Terme, in the province of Salerno, in Southern Italy, and involves the supply of H2NG (a blend of hydrogen and gas) to two industrial companies in the area: a pasta factory and a mineral water bottling company.
The experiment was launched in the presence of Undersecretary for Economic Development, Andrea Cioffi, along with Snam CEO, Marco Alverà.
Hydrogen will play a crucial role in securing the achievement of European and global decarbonisation targets by 2050. Hydrogen combustion does not generate carbon dioxide emissions. Furthermore, in the future, \'green\' hydrogen produced through electrolysis from renewables such as sun and wind will allow these non-programmable energy sources to benefit from the widespread gas transmission network and storage, helping to meet the challenge of green energy intermittency.
Snam CEO, Marco Alverà, said: \'Europe\'s first injection of hydrogen into a transmission network directly supplying industrial customers projects Snam and our country into the future of clean energy. Renewable gases such as green hydrogen and biomethane will play a central role in the decarbonised energy mix beyond 2050, together with traditional renewable sources. Hydrogen will become increasingly important in Snam\'s strategy and we have the skills and technology to become leaders in this sector. We felt compelled to begin this innovative project in Southern Italy and Campania due to our strong connection with the territory\'.
General Secretary of Hydrogen Europe, Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, said: \'Hydrogen is key to greening the grids and integrating more and more renewables in our energy systems, aiming to achieve full decarbonisation of the continent at the lowest cost for consumers and companies. Italy has the potential to become the European hydrogen hub in the next decades because it has the most extensive gas network already in place and is the bridging country to North Africa, where most of green hydrogen from solar will be produced in the future\'.
Testing of the H2NG supply will continue for around one month. Applying a proportion of 5% of hydrogen to the total gas transported annually by Snam, 3.5 billion cubic meters could be injected into the network each year, equivalent to the annual consumption of 1.5 million households. This would enable the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 2.5 million tons, equivalent to the total emissions of all cars in a city the size of Rome or half of the cars in a region the size of Campania.
This experiment marks the first step in Snam\'s commitment to developing hydrogen. The company is committed to verifying the full compatibility of its infrastructure with increasing quantities of hydrogen blended with natural gas as well as in the study of hydrogen production from renewable electricity.
According to a recent study by the consultancy firm Navigant, promoted by the Gas for Climate consortium (of which Snam is also a member), by 2050, Europe has the potential to produce 270 billion cubic meters of renewable gas (around 170 bcm of hydrogen and 100 bcm of biomethane). This would support the achievement of decarbonisation targets thanks to existing infrastructure, with annual savings of 217 billion euros compared to a scenario that foresees a minimum gas contribution.

The pan-region STOXX 600 index was down 0.13 percent at 0723 GMT, having touched eight-month highs last week.
Germany\'s trade sensitive DAX index fell 0.3 percent, breaking a seven day winning streak - its longest since October 2017.
Earlier on Monday data showed that German exports and imports fell more than expected in February, the latest sign that Europe\'s biggest economy will likely post meagre growth in the first quarter.
Auto stocks underperformed after a near 7 percent surge last week.
BMW, Daimler declined, with both facing possibly hefty fines after EU antitrust regulators charged them with colluding to block the rollout of clean emissions technology.
Continental AG fell 1.7 percent as Kepler Cheuvreux downgraded the auto parts maker to "hold" from "buy".
By contrast Italian-U.S. carmaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) rose after it agreed to pay electric carmaker Tesla Inc hundreds of millions of euros to allow Tesla vehicles to be counted in its fleet to avoid fines for violating new EU emission rules.
Software company SAP weighed the most on the STOXX 600 index, down 1.5 percent as Europe\'s most valuable technology company said the head of its cloud business group had quit, the latest in a string of top departures.
Irish stocks, a barometer of Brexit sentiment, ended a six-day winning run.
Britain\'s government held out the possibility of compromise with the opposition Labour Party on Sunday to try to win support in parliament for leaving the European Union with a deal. UK Prime Minister Theresa May heads to Brussels this week to ask for a further delay until June 30.
Banco BPM dropped 1.3 percent as Italy\'s third biggest lender said it could be interested in tie-ups with banks close to its home turf in the north of the country, comments that appeared to play down a possible deal with Monte dei Paschi di Siena.
Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank dropped 0.4 percent and 1.5 percent respectively. European bank supervisors demanded a detailed roadmap outlining the pace and scale of staff cuts in the two lenders as they explore a merger, according to German daily Handelsblatt\'s report. The two German lenders favour a straightforward merger over more complex ways to structure a deal, Reuters reported on Friday.

SHIMANO STEPS research shows the UK lags behind the rest of Europe,
while the Netherlands leads the way
SHIMANO STEPS today reveals the results of the largest European e-bike
study looking at people’s willingness to commute to work by e-bike. The
independent research* of over 12,000 people across 10 markets, reveals
that 24% of European commuters would consider switching to an e-bike.
Almost half of the population of the Netherlands (47%) would commute to
work by e-bike, the highest in Europe, while 39% of people in Spain and
33% in Italy would make the switch.
This press release features multimedia. View the full release here:

The SHIMANO STEPS research reveals that across Europe, the main reasons
to consider commuting to work by e-bike are “to keep fit” (34%) “to
protect the environment” (30%) and “to save money” (30%). People are put
off riding an e-bike to work because of “the possibility of bad weather”
(37%), “the cost of an e-bike” (34%) and “arriving to work sweaty” (25%).
People in the UK are the least likely to choose an e-bike to commute to
work, with only 11% willing to consider making the switch, well below
the European average. The “possibility of bad weather” (43%) and
“arriving to work sweaty” (35%) proved to be the main reasons for the UK
public to resist the switch to an e-bike.
“We’re seeing huge growth in the e-bike market across Europe and this
research highlights the likelihood of widespread adoption of e-bikes to
commute to work in the future,” said Jeroen Van Vulpen, Brand
Manager SHIMANO STEPS. “We know that there is already a strong
cycling culture in specific countries, where those who\'ve made the
switch to an e-bike have found that bad weather is rarely an
insurmountable problem and sweat is a thing of the past when you let the
electric assistance take the strain. It’s really encouraging to see that
across all markets, people are willing to switch to an e-bike to keep
fit and protect the environment.”
“We welcome this research from Shimano, which confirms that there is
huge potential for power assisted bicycles, especially combined with the
building of longer distance cycle highways,” said Ádám Bodor,
Advocacy Director, European Cyclists\' Federation. “These bikes are a
great addition to the bicycle family contributing to sustainable active
transport by being available to substitute ever longer car journeys.”

After attending the 21st China-EU leaders\' meeting in Brussels, Premier Li Keqiang continues his Europe tour with an official visit to Croatia - both a member state of the European Union and a participant in the cooperation mechanism between China and 16 Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC). Premier Li will also take part in the annual China-CEEC summit in Dubrovnik, a city on Croatia\'s Adriatic coast.
Premier Li\'s Europe tour comes just two weeks after President Xi Jinping\'s visits to Italy, Monaco and France. Both leaders chose Europe as the destination of their first overseas trips this year, highlighting the importance that China attaches to its ties with Europe.
Situated at the crossroads of Central and Southeastern Europe as well as the Mediterranean, Croatia has a major role to play in the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and in connecting Europe with China more closely.
A natural bridge
Premier Li\'s visit is the first ever by a Chinese premier to Croatia since the establishment of diplomatic ties, \'consolidating traditional friendship and advancing comprehensive cooperative partnership between the two sides\' will be a major task during the visit as Vice-Foreign Minister Wang Chao said at a press briefing.
During Premier Li\'s visit, China and Croatia will issue a joint statement summarizing any important consensus reached by their leaders and mapping out future cooperation; the two sides will sign government cooperation documents and commercial contracts covering multiple sectors, according to Wang.
A survey released in March last year showed that some 89 percent of the respondents thought that relations between Croatia and China were friendly, 86 percent supported Chinese investments in Croatia, especially in areas of infrastructure, tourism and e-commerce, and 85 percent believed that China was a reliable cooperation partner.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A new professional league for elite swimmers will debut this year with U.S. and foreign teams competing in a mixed gender format with the athletes being paid.
Five-time Olympic champion Katie Ledecky will compete for one of the International Swimming League\'s eight teams — four based in the U.S. and four in Europe.
Ledecky said the league "represents a new era for professional swimming."
"Especially for competitive women like me," she said Tuesday. "Jumping in the pool for the ISL really means a new era for women since it\'s one of the first leagues to emphasize gender equality as one of its values."
Besides Ledecky, fellow Americans Nathan Adrian, Simone Manuel and Ryan Murphy have been tabbed as ambassadors. They\'re expected to both compete and help promote the inaugural season.
The ISL won\'t begin until after this summer\'s world championships in South Korea, while a planned 2020 season would start after the Tokyo Olympics.
Sports Videos
Founded by Ukrainian financier Konstantin Grigorishin, the league will launch Oct. 4-5, with meets held nearly every weekend through Nov. 24. The league championship will be in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay in a temporary pool on Dec. 20-21. The racing will be in short-course meters rather than the long-course format used in the Olympics.
"The show that is going to go around it will be quite a production, very fan-oriented," former Olympic medalist Kaitlin Sandeno said.
The U.S. will be represented by: the New York Breakers, the Los Angeles Current, the DC Trident, and the Cali Condors based in San Francisco.
The Breakers will be overseen by general manager Tina Andrew, mother and manager of swimmer Michael Andrew. The Current will be led by retired Olympic backstroke champion Lenny Krayzelburg, the Condors by retired four-time Olympic champion Jason Lezak, and the Trident by Sandeno.
The European teams will be based in London, Rome, Budapest and likely France.
Full rosters will be announced in the coming weeks.
Swimmers will compete for team points in various styles of races, with 12 men and 12 women on each team. The ISL said numerous Olympic champions and world record holders will participate.
"There\'s something about competing for a team title," five-time Olympic champion Adrian said. "It\'s a different kind of energy than what swimmers are used to."
The ISL will have a zero tolerance doping policy and won\'t allow any swimmer with a previous doping violation to participate.
Swimmers will sign two contracts: one with their team and another with the ISL. Revenue will flow from the clubs and the league to the athletes. Grigorishin said revenue will be split 50-50 between the league and swimmers.
"We have one of the hardest working athletes in the sports world and they deserve more than we have gotten so far," Krayzelburg said. "It\'s going to change the landscape, create more exposure and opportunities for our athletes and put the sport of swimming on the forefront, not just in the Olympic year."
Currently, professional swimmers have the TYR Pro Swim Series in the U.S. and the FINA World Cup between August and November in Europe, Asia and the Middle East in which they compete for prize money.
The ISL has overcome roadblocks to its formation, having filed a federal antitrust lawsuit last year against FINA, the sport\'s international governing body.
FINA announced its own Champions Swim Series made up of invitation-only meets in Guangzhou, Budapest and Indianapolis in April and May. Total prize money is $3.9 million and the competitions will include some of the sport\'s biggest names.
"We have no principle conflict with FINA," Grigorishin said. "FINA should be responsible for the whole swimming world. The league is just for the elite swimmers. Somebody has to regulate and set up the rules in swimming. If you are a regulator, you should not be organizer of competition. In the future, FINA will have to make a choice."
Grigorishin said negotiations with global broadcasting outlets are ongoing.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.
___
1:50 p.m.
The European Central Bank has kept its policy promises, interest rates and stimulus settings unchanged as officials weigh looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a news conference Thursday, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more monetary stimulus in coming months. Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for an interest rate increase from the end of the year into next year.

DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) — China\'s prime minister has promised that Beijing will respect European standards and fair trade, seeking to allay concerns that it\'s flouting EU competition rules with huge investments on the continent.
Opening an annual summit of Eastern and Central European nations and China, Li Keqiang said "we intend to fully respect European standards."
Beijing has also been criticized for failing to give reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
He adds "we welcome openness and we want to treat all companies that operate in China equally and to increase imports from the (European) countries."
EU member Croatia is hosting a two-day summit between China and 16 regional countries on expanding business between China and the region, dubbed 16+1.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members — or those hoping to join — could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.
Of the 16 participating countries — Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia — 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

European court: Russia\'s house arrest of Navalny unlawful
\r

\t \r
\r
\t\r
MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
Navalny, a leading opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed Tuesday\'s ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled Tuesday that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict.

BERLIN (AP) — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.

BERLIN (AP) — A group of 14 European scientific institutions plan to retrieve the world\'s oldest ice as part of research into past climate change.
The consortium led by the Germany-based Alfred Wegener Institute said Tuesday it has identified an area in Antarctica, nicknamed "Little Dome C," that should harbor ice as old as 1.5 million years.
So-called ice core measurements are crucial for scientists\' understanding of past climatic changes on Earth and the models they use to predict future global warming or cooling.
Current ice core measurements provide reliable data going back only about 800,000 years.
At a meeting in Vienna, the institutes said they spent the past three years working with American, Australian, Japanese and Russian colleagues using radar to determine the best possible site for drilling.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."

Two British staffers and one confused American staffer talk Brexit in a group message \xe2\x80\x93 again.
Rebecca Asoulin\xc2\xa0(engagement editor, American): March 29 felt a bit like Y2K. We thought something catastrophic might happen. But nothing happened. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the United Kingdom leave the European Union last week?
Simon Montlake\xc2\xa0(Brexit reporter, Brit): The easy answer is that the U.K. couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree on exit terms with the EU and had to go back and ask for more time, which was a big climbdown for Prime Minister Theresa May after two years of saying that March 29 was exit day.\xc2\xa0The delay\xc2\xa0means that the can has been kicked down the road, as Peter predicted last time, right?
Peter Ford\xc2\xa0(senior global correspondent, Brit): Well, I thought there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a solution, but I did not appreciate the full extent of the mess the U.K. would be in now.
Rebecca: What do you mean by that? How is it a bigger mess now?
Peter: The British government is no further forward than it was the last time we had this conversation, but now there are only 10 days till the new deadline, April 12. And the choices are the same as ever: (1) Ms. May\xe2\x80\x99s deal, (2) a second referendum on Brexit, (3) a national election, or (4) a no-deal Brexit. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same mess with less time to sort it out.

Simon: On the plus side, we have eliminated some unicorns.
Rebecca: Which ones?
Simon: If you remember the drama over Ireland and the dreaded backstop, there was a unicorn lurking in the wings. Conservative pro-Brexit Members of Parliament demanded that Ms. May go back to the EU and find \xe2\x80\x9calternative arrangements\xe2\x80\x9d to keep the border open after Britain leaves. Turns out that there are no magical alternatives. So we slayed that particular unicorn. Unfortunately the same pro-Brexit MPs are gunning for a no-deal exit and might feel that time is on their side. What do you think, Peter?
Peter: Those who want a hard Brexit with no deal are rubbing their hands with glee each time the clock strikes midnight. Another day closer to the exit, another day with no agreement on a practical alternative.
Rebecca: But the majority of MPs want to leave in an orderly fashion, right? I mean they\xe2\x80\x99re British!
Simon: Yes. Parliament has voted emphatically against a chaotic exit. But what Parliament can\xe2\x80\x99t agree on is what kind of exit it wants, so the legal default (a no-deal Brexit) is arguably the least popular option. Perplexing, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?
It\xe2\x80\x99s as if a military strategist dreamed up a new version of game theory and wanted to see how it would work in an actual democracy.
Peter: But MPs and the government are playing games with the country\xe2\x80\x99s future and it is not funny anymore.
Simon: European leaders aren\xe2\x80\x99t laughing. They might be weeping with frustration.
Peter: They are indeed. The head of the European Commission called David Cameron, the former prime minister who started the whole thing by calling the Brexit referendum, \xe2\x80\x9cone of the great destroyers of modern times\xe2\x80\x9d yesterday evening.
Simon: A side note \xe2\x80\x93 I was at a discussion at Harvard yesterday where a speaker mistakenly referred to James Cameron. James Cameron was the director of the film \xe2\x80\x9cTitanic.\xe2\x80\x9d Which seems terribly apposite at the moment. Are MPs in Parliament rearranging the deck chairs and willing the iceberg to move?
Peter: Seems to me they are just pretending the iceberg isn\xe2\x80\x99t there. The public have been fed up with government handling of Brexit for some time. Now they are getting increasingly fed up with Parliament and its inability to agree on anything.
Parliamentarians have proved very bad at politics. None of them are showing any readiness to compromise on their maximalist positions. We are getting dangerously close to a situation where a lot of voters are going to be in a \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the point of politicians?\xe2\x80\x9d mood, and that will give demagogues a field day.
Simon: Do we need to talk about the extraordinary takeover of Parliament by its members?
Peter: Briefly ...
Simon:\xc2\xa0In a parliamentary system, the government controls the business of the legislature. What bills are discussed, motions tabled, etc.\xc2\xa0
Last week there was a cross-party takeover of this process. And that\xe2\x80\x99s how we ended up with the last two days of voting on alternatives to Ms. May\xe2\x80\x99s Brexit deal.
Imagine if junior representatives from both parties in Congress had seized the gavel from Speaker Nancy Pelosi and said, \xe2\x80\x9cOK, let\xe2\x80\x99s pass some major legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d
It was a remarkable twist in the story, and frankly a necessary effort to force change on Ms. May\xe2\x80\x99s government. Since she has no Plan B.
Peter: Except that they have signally failed to pass major legislation. Still no majority in favor of anything.
Rebecca:\xc2\xa0So what happens next? Britain seems to be getting lost deeper in the weeds as it tries to untangle itself. Is the future more uncertain now than when we talked before?\xc2\xa0(How is that possible!)
Peter:\xc2\xa0Crystal ball time, Simon....
Simon: My crystal ball is cloudy. The lights went out!
Peter:\xc2\xa0The future is no more uncertain, but that is becoming increasingly urgent. Urgent uncertainty. Does that get us anywhere?
Simon:\xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s remember that Ms. May still thinks she can get her deal approved by Parliament.\xc2\xa0
Rebecca:\xc2\xa0(But it\xe2\x80\x99s failed three times!)
Simon:\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see how Ms. May succeeds. She already played her trump card by offering to step down as leader if the deal passes. And that still didn\xe2\x80\x99t get her a majority.
Can she really get a majority after three failures? Hard to imagine. Even if she did there are many legislative steps to go, and a shaky coalition is easily undone. So the EU might conclude that she\xe2\x80\x99s simply unable to deliver Brexit in its current form.\xc2\xa0
Peter:\xc2\xa0One reason Brexit is so hard to agree on is that the country and its political class are divided so equally and so ambiguously: 52-48 to leave at the referendum, and now 53-47 to remain, according to polls.\xc2\xa0
Rebecca:\xc2\xa0So you two think Ms. May\xe2\x80\x99s deal as it is won\xe2\x80\x99t pass. What does that leave?
Simon:\xc2\xa0I expect the U.K. will ask for another extension next week at an emergency EU summit.
The question is, what will U.K. say is the reason for the extension? To hold an election to break the deadlock? Or a referendum on whether to Brexit or not?
It\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to say, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we still can\xe2\x80\x99t make up our minds. Sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d That won\xe2\x80\x99t cut it.\xc2\xa0
Peter:\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll stick my head out.\xc2\xa0I think there will be an election, which will be fought almost entirely on the Brexit issue, (so it will in effect be a referendum).\xc2\xa0
The whole system of government is in danger of seizing up, unable to reach a decision on the most important question before it in more than 50 years. The government might simply collapse.
Rebecca:\xc2\xa0I started this conversation thinking something catastrophic had been avoided on March 29. But has it just been delayed unless the British Parliament can correct course? Do you two have any final thoughts?
Peter:\xc2\xa0My thought is that I am looking forward to the day when I do not have to think any longer about Brexit. But to be frank, I am not certain when that day will dawn.
Simon:\xc2\xa0I expect to be back in the U.K. covering an election sooner than expected.\xc2\xa0
My big surprise when I was reporting in London last time is that while there is animosity toward the EU for striking a hard bargain, the biggest blame seems to be directed at British politicians on the other side of the negotiations. So perhaps some introspection will serve to lighten the difficult path ahead!
Rebecca:\xc2\xa0This potential election seems to me almost like the last Boston Marathon \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0the weather was so terrible that the winners were completely unexpected.
Peter:\xc2\xa0My kind of marathon....
Rebecca: Perhaps there are some obscure MPs and parties who will end up taking power.
Thank you both for taking time again to talk!
Peter:\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve enjoyed it. And I am confident that another occasion to ruminate on Brexit will soon present itself.\xc2\xa0
This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity and length.
Editor\xe2\x80\x99s note:\xc2\xa0After this conversation was held, Ms. May said the U.K. would seek to extend the deadline for leaving the EU from April 12 to May 22. She\xc2\xa0announced cross-party talks to find a compromise to break the deadlock.

Early results in Ukraine\'s presidential election showed a comedian with no political experience with a sizable lead over 38 rivals but far from a first-round victory, while the incumbent president and a former prime minister were close contenders to advance to the runoff.
The strong showing of Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Sunday\'s voting appeared to reflect Ukrainians\' desire for new blood in a political system awash in corruption and a new approach to trying to end the war with Russia-backed separatists in the country\'s east that has wracked the country for nearly five years.
With 20 percent of the polling station protocols counted, Mr. Zelenskiy had 30 percent, while incumbent President Petro Poroshenko was a distant second with about 17 percent and Yulia Tymoshenko with 13, the elections commission said early Monday. The results were closely in line with a major exit poll.
The top two candidates advance to a runoff on April 21. Final results in Sunday\'s first round are expected to be announced later Monday.
The election was shadowed by allegations of widespread vote buying. Police said they had received more than 2,100 complaints of violations on voting day alone in addition to hundreds of earlier voting fraud claims, including bribery attempts and removing ballots from polling places.
Mr. Zelenskiy stars in a TV sitcom about a teacher who becomes president after a video of him denouncing corruption goes viral and his supporters hold out hope that he can fight corruption in real life.
"This is only the first step to a great victory," Mr. Zelenskiy told reporters after the exit poll was announced.
"Zelenskiy has shown us on the screen what a real president should be like," said voter Tatiana Zinchenko, who cast her ballot for the comedian. "He showed what the state leader should aspire for \xe2\x80\x93 fight corruption by deeds, not words, help the poor, control the oligarchs."
Campaign issues in the country of 42 million included Ukraine\'s endemic corruption, its struggling economy and a seemingly intractable conflict with Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that has killed 13,000 people since 2014.
Concern about the election\'s legitimacy have spiked in recent days after Ukraine\'s interior minister said his department was "showered" with hundreds of claims that supporters of Mr. Poroshenko and Ms. Tymoshenko had offered money in exchange for votes.
Like the popular character he plays, Mr. Zelenskiy made corruption a focus of his candidacy. He proposed a lifetime ban on holding public office for anyone convicted of graft. He also called for direct negotiations with Russia on ending the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
"A new life, a normal life is starting," Mr. Zelenskiy said after casting his ballot in Kiev. "A life without corruption, without bribes."
His lack of political experience helped his popularity with voters amid broad disillusionment with the country\'s political elite.
Mr. Poroshenko said "I feel no kind of euphoria" after the exit poll results were announced.
"I critically and soberly understand the signal that society gave today to the acting authorities," he said.
It is not clear whether he would or could adjust his campaign enough to meet Mr. Zelenskiy\'s challenges over the next three weeks.
Mr. Poroshenko, a confectionary tycoon when he was elected five years ago, pushed successfully for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to be recognized as self-standing rather than a branch of the Russian church.
However, he saw approval of his governing sink amid Ukraine\'s economic woes and a sharp plunge in living standards. Mr. Poroshenko campaigned on promises to defeat the rebels in the east and to wrest back control of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 in a move that has drawn sanctions against Russia from the U.S. and the European Union.
Speaking at a polling station Sunday, the president echoed his campaign promises of taking Ukraine into the EU and NATO.
The president\'s priorities persuaded schoolteacher Andriy Hristenko to vote for him
"Poroshenko has done a lot. He created our own church, bravely fought with Moscow and is trying to open the way to the EU and NATO," Mr. Hristenko said.
Ukraine\'s former prime minister, Ms. Tymoshenko, shaped her message around the economic distress of millions in the country.
"Ukraine has sunk into poverty and corruption during the last five years, but every Ukrainian can put an end to it now," she said after voting Sunday.
During the campaign, Ms. Tymoshenko denounced price hikes introduced by Mr. Poroshenko as "economic genocide" and promised to reduce prices for household gas by 50 percent within a month of taking office.
"I don\'t need a bright future in 50 years," said Olha Suhiy, a cook. "I want hot water and heating to cost less tomorrow."
A military embezzlement scheme that allegedly involved top Mr. Poroshenko associates as well as a factory controlled by the president dogged Mr. Poroshenko before the election. Ultra-right activists shadowed him throughout the campaign, demanding the jailing of the president\'s associates accused in the scandal.
Mr. Zelenskiy and Ms. Tymoshenko both used the alleged embezzlement to take hits at Mr. Poroshenko, who shot back at his rivals. He described them as puppets of a self-exiled billionaire businessman Igor Kolomoyskyi, charges that Mr. Zelenskiy and Ms. Tymoshenko denied.
Many political observers have described the presidential election as a battle between Mr. Poroshenko and Mr. Kolomoyskyi.
Both the president and the comedian relied on an arsenal of media outlets under their control to exchange blows. Just days before the election, the TV channel Mr. Kolomoyskyi owns aired a new season of the "Servant of the People" TV series in which Mr. Zelenskiy stars as Ukraine\'s leader.

"Kolomoyskyi has succeeded in creating a wide front against Poroshenko," said Vadim Karasyov, head of the Institute of Global Strategies, an independent Kiev-based think tank. "Ukraine has gone through two revolutions, but ended up with the same thing \xe2\x80\x93 the fight between the oligarchs for the power and resources."

President Donald Trump praised NATO countries for increasing their financial contributions to the Western alliance, but he hounded them to pay even more, saying America still shoulders a disproportionate share of the cost of protecting Europe.
The president met Tuesday with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who was in Washington to mark the 70th anniversary of the organization formed to counter Russian aggression.
The two leaders had kind words for one another. But in the past, Mr. Trump has called NATO "obsolete" and suggested he might pull the United States out of the alliance if member nations didn\'t significantly boost their defense spending.
"We\'ve worked together on getting some of our allies to pay their fair share," Mr. Trump told reporters. "At some point, it\'s going to have to go higher."
Mr. Trump took credit for the increased spending. However, spending by the 29 NATO countries, which dropped after the end of the Cold War, has actually been rising since 2014 \xe2\x80\x93 before Mr. Trump took office.
"Prior to our getting here, NATO\'s spending was going way, way down," he said. "It was just a one-way road down. And since I became president ... it\'s been a rocket ship up, and we have to keep it that way."
After Russia\'s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\'s Crimean Peninsula, member countries agreed to boost defense budgets and "move toward" spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. The U.S. spends about 3.4 percent of its GDP on defense.
Since Mr. Trump took office, European allies and Canada have added $41 billion to their defense budgets. By the end of next year, this will rise to $100 billion, Mr. Stoltenberg said. Germany, however, remains the main target of Mr. Trump\'s ire because it now plans to spend 1.5 percent by 2024, which is lower than the 2 percent guideline.
"Germany is not paying their fair share," Mr. Trump said. "I have a great feeling for Germany, but they\'re not paying what they should be paying. We\'re paying for a big proportion of NATO, which is basically protecting Europe."
Mr. Stoltenberg has said that the 2 percent guideline was not invented by the United States and was a target the 29 allies set in 2014 before Mr. Trump took office. But he thanked Mr. Trump for his "strong commitment to NATO" and for his leadership in getting member nations to increase their commitments.
"The allies are really stepping up," Mr. Stoltenberg said in an interview later with The Associated Press.
"The clear message from President Trump has helped \xe2\x80\x93 is having a real impact. And this is about doing what NATO allies have pledged to do. We still have a long way to go \xe2\x80\x93 much to do \xe2\x80\x93 but we have really seen very strong progress in defense spending from NATO allies."
At times, Mr. Stoltenberg has served as a buffer between Mr. Trump and some European allies that he has angered.
Mr. Trump, who ran on an "America First" platform, slapped tariffs on the European Union, and pulled the U.S. out of the landmark Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal. Mr. Trump\'s eagerness to get along with Russian leader Vladimir Putin \xe2\x80\x93 in spite of Russia\'s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and numerous other aggressive moves in recent years \xe2\x80\x93 has alarmed those who view Russia as a growing threat.
"NATO\'s single greatest challenge is the absence of strong, principled American presidential leadership for the first time in its history," two former U.S. envoys to NATO, Nicholas Burns and Douglas Lute, wrote in a report on the 70th birthday for the Harvard Kennedy School\'s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
Mr. Lute and Mr. Burns said NATO leaders considered not holding a 2019 summit to mark the 70th anniversary at all because they feared Mr. Trump would "blow up a meeting in controversy as he has done each time he has met with NATO leaders during the past two years." The alliance plans a scaled-down summit of leaders in December that Mr. Trump is expected to attend.
Allies see Mr. Trump as NATO\'s "most urgent, and often most difficult, problem," they wrote in their report. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Mr. Trump, saying their conclusion was "just simply wrong" and adding that the administration has worked hard to make NATO stronger.
Mr. Stoltenberg is slated to address Congress on Wednesday morning \xe2\x80\x93 a first for a NATO secretary-general. The invitation to speak to a joint meeting of the Democratic-controlled House and the Republican-controlled Senate shows the bipartisan support the 70-year-old trans-Atlantic alliance enjoys among lawmakers in spite of Mr. Trump\'s occasional jabs.
The NATO foreign ministers\' first session Thursday will focus on Russia. The ministers are expected to endorse a package of measures to improve NATO\'s defenses in the Black Sea.
Other topics will be NATO\'s mission in Afghanistan and Turkey\'s announced decision to buy a Russian surface-to-air missile system. Turkey is a NATO ally, but the Russian system is not compatible with NATO systems and is considered a threat to U.S. F-35 aircraft.
They also will talk about U.S. and Russian plans to withdraw this summer from a 1987 landmark arms control treaty. The U.S. accuses Russia of violating the treaty; Moscow says the U.S. is not in compliance.
If the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty is scrapped, neither Washington nor Moscow would face legal constraints on deploying land-based cruise or ballistic missiles with ranges between 310 and 3,410 miles. Defense officials say the Pentagon plans to begin flight tests later this year of two types of missiles that have been banned by the treaty for more than 30 years.

"Russia is deploying more and more of these weapons and therefore we call on Russia to come back into compliance with this treaty," Mr. Stoltenberg said.

Polls show a majority of Conservative supporters prefer to see the U.K. walk away without an agreement on April 12, something Ms. May opposes. Meanwhile, Mr. Corbyn\xe2\x80\x99s own views of EU membership are at odds with his followers. He voted against the U.K. joining in 1975 and was a lackluster campaigner for "remain" in 2016. But a poll by a pro-Labour trade union projected a loss of 45 seats in a snap election if the party fails to oppose Brexit.
Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May and her opposition rival, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, have struggled to unite their fractious parties around Brexit positions that don\xe2\x80\x99t sink them politically, now or in the future. Both leaders are wary of any compromise that delivers Brexit but cleaves their respective parties into \xe2\x80\x9cremain\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cleave\xe2\x80\x9d factions.
Whatever side of the Brexit debate one is on, there is no disagreement that it is a confusing, messy process. Some of that is rooted in the philosophy of Brexit itself: whether it is better for the United Kingdom to remain within the European Union or not. But another major factor is a common political issue: the tension between party and country.
\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t
When Prime Minister Theresa May reached across the aisle last week for help in delivering Brexit, her eleventh-hour pivot had an air of inevitability. Her own Conservative Party had failed to back her withdrawal agreement with the European Union on three separate votes in Parliament, humiliating Ms. May and forcing her to extend the United Kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s March 29 deadline for departure.
Without a majority on her own benches, Ms. May has held talks with the opposition Labour Party in a bid to pass the withdrawal agreement on time. On Sunday, she made a pitch to the public in a presidential-style video from a sofa in a wood-paneled office.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll mean compromise on both sides, but I believe delivering Brexit is the most important thing for us. I think that people voted to leave the EU. We have a duty as a Parliament to deliver this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.
Outside observers might wonder what took her so long.
The reason lies in the tension between party interests and national interests \xe2\x80\x93 something familiar to leaders everywhere. While the demands of party invariably come into play, politicians usually look for ways to square them with what they perceive to be best for their country.
Ms. May and her opposition rival, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, have struggled to unite their fractious parties around Brexit positions that don\xe2\x80\x99t sink them politically, now or in the future. Both leaders are wary of any compromise that delivers Brexit but cleaves their respective parties into \xe2\x80\x9cremain\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cleave\xe2\x80\x9d factions.
Divided parties
Ms. May has \xe2\x80\x9cvery clearly been putting the interest of party unity first,\xe2\x80\x9d says Amanda Sloat, a senior fellow in the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution. But she has failed to win over her own pro-Brexit members of Parliament who demand that the EU makes more concessions, particularly on intra-Ireland trade, says Ms. Sloat. Now \xe2\x80\x9cthe only alternative is to pivot in the other direction and try to get some support from Labour MPs.\xe2\x80\x9d
Some Labour MPs would be happy to oblige: Their constituencies voted to leave and look dimly on Parliament\xe2\x80\x99s foot-dragging. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do have a majority of MPs across the house who would be supportive of some kind of softer Brexit,\xe2\x80\x9d says Thom Brooks, the dean of Durham Law School in Durham, England, and a professor of politics.
In the nomenclature of Brexit, \xe2\x80\x9csoft\xe2\x80\x9d means keeping the U.K. in a tighter future embrace. Mr. Corbyn has called for a customs agreement to duplicate the current arrangements that provide frictionless trade for U.K. companies across Europe, as well as EU-adopted protection for workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights and alignment with other EU regulations.

But the idea of a soft Brexit, or any Brexit at all, is anathema to the majority of Labour members who voted to remain in the 2016 referendum. A recent petition calling for the revocation of Britain\xe2\x80\x99s departure got over 6 million signatures within a week, a record response. Many came from Labour-voting seats that are more youthful and pro-European and support holding a second referendum on Brexit as a condition of Labour cutting any deal with Ms. May.
Yet the same petition reveals a fault line within Labour that parallels Ms. May\xe2\x80\x99s dilemma. Some of the constituencies with the fewest signatures were also Labour seats, mostly in working-class districts away from the affluent southeast. These seats could be crucial to any future electoral victory for Mr. Corbyn, whose surge in 2017 cost Ms. May her parliamentary majority.
But younger voters could turn against Mr. Corbyn if he\xe2\x80\x99s seen as abetting a Conservative-led Brexit, says Steven Fielding, a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham. \xe2\x80\x9cYoung people didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote Labour in order to support Brexit,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.
A poll by a pro-Labour trade union projected a loss of 45 seats in a snap election if the party fails to oppose Brexit, the Guardian reported in February. More immediately, Mr. Corbyn has to keep onside critics in his shadow cabinet who have campaigned for a second referendum and prevent more defections in Parliament to a new independent caucus.
Mr. Corbyn\xe2\x80\x99s own views of EU membership are at odds with his followers. A lifelong socialist, he voted against the U.K. joining in 1975 and was a lackluster campaigner for remain in 2016. His left-wing allies oppose EU rules that restrict state spending on national industries.
Helping Ms. May to deliver Brexit would allow him to return to his attack lines on the economy, says Mr. Fielding, who is writing a history of the modern Labour Party. \xe2\x80\x9cBrexit is a complication for him. ... His basic path to victory is to get Brexit out of the way with as little damage as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x98What an astonishing achievement\xe2\x80\x99
For Ms. May that isn\xe2\x80\x99t an option; she has already agreed to step down if and when Brexit happens. But her right flank is livid at her pivot to Mr. Corbyn, a left-winger they despise. A letter published last week in the pro-Conservative Telegraph pithily described this anger: \xe2\x80\x9cSIR \xe2\x80\x93 Mrs May is despised by much of the Labour Party simply for being a Tory. She is now despised by much of the Tory party for not being a Tory. What an astonishing achievement.\xe2\x80\x9d
Polls show a majority of Conservative supporters, though not MPs, prefer to see the U.K. walk away without an agreement as an EU-imposed deadline looms on April 12. Ms. May is attending an emergency EU summit on Wednesday to seek a longer extension.
Even if Ms. May and Mr. Corbyn can eventually agree on a Brexit strategy to put to Parliament, its approval would not end the drama, given the tensions within both parties, warns Ms. Sloat. MPs still need to legislate in support of Brexit and rebellions may prove hard to contain.
\xe2\x80\x9cTheresa May needs a parliamentary coalition not only to pass the deal but also to pass implementing legislation. It\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to just get this agreement and then see Parliament collapse,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.
In Britain, the historical parallel for Ms. May\xe2\x80\x99s dilemma is the 1846 repeal of the pro-landowner Corn Laws, which split the Victorian-era Conservative Party and cast it out of government for three decades. The repeal was in the national interest, but not in the interest of the ruling party.

The irony for today\xe2\x80\x99s Conservatives is that the 2016 referendum was supposed to settle a perennial intraparty war over Europe. Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron called the referendum believing that he could win and thereby modernize a party that was \xe2\x80\x9cbanging on about Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d not voters\xe2\x80\x99 daily concerns. Instead he set the U.K. on a path that has made EU relations more polarizing than ever \xe2\x80\x93 and destabilized his own party.
\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a crisis entirely formed by an existential problem of the Conservatives,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Brooks.

\xe2\x80\x9cYou see a lot of homeless people on the street but rarely interact and talk with them,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tom Austin, one of the co-founders of the tour company. This is \xe2\x80\x9ca way for people to engage, ask questions, to understand that ... anyone can lose a job, fall out of a relationship, fall behind on mortgage payments. Without the right support network, that can be anyone. We\'re here about empowering them and giving them the skills to tell their own stories.\xe2\x80\x9d
But today he is working, leading tours around the neighborhood he knows intimately. His employer, Secret Street Tours, has launched an effort to make a dent in a national crisis: Homelessness in Ireland shot up by 14 percent in 2018. In greater Dublin, the number of homeless families increased last year for the sixth year in a row. The increases are largely driven by a shortage of affordable housing.
Derek McGuire was born into homelessness, but he built a career, a family, and a life. Then it all fell apart.
\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t
\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t
Derek McGuire leads a tour around the Liberties, a working-class neighborhood of Dublin, covering centuries of history on a blustery day \xe2\x80\x93 from workers\xe2\x80\x99 tenements to the handsome brick apartments built to improve their living conditions and a hostel for homeless men that still operates today.
That history is relevant in Dublin now, where a soaring rate of homelessness has become a national crisis. And Mr. McGuire is uniquely qualified to tell it. Born and raised in the Liberties, he\xe2\x80\x99s experienced homelessness himself. His tour is part of a new initiative called Secret Street Tours, whose guides are people affected by homelessness. It aims to empower them with skills and opportunity, while also changing public perceptions of a pressing national issue.
McGuire is a co-founder and the organization\xe2\x80\x99s first guide. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo years ago, I thought all passion inside of me was completely dead. I had no motivation,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cSince I started this tour, it\xe2\x80\x99s completely and totally rejuvenated me. I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m living again, and I want to live again. I feel like I have a contribution to make.\xe2\x80\x9d
The number of people experiencing homelessness in Ireland shot up by 14 percent in 2018. In greater Dublin, the number of families entering homelessness increased last year for the sixth year in a row, according to Focus Ireland, a charity that works to end homelessness. The rise in homelessness is largely driven by a shortage of affordable housing.
In the past, many who found themselves without a home suffered from health or addiction issues, disabilities, or domestic violence. \xe2\x80\x9cAll those problems are still there, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a massive amount of people who are just becoming homeless for economic reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d says Roughan Mac Namara, advocacy director for Focus Ireland. \xe2\x80\x9cMost people who are becoming homeless now, it\xe2\x80\x99s because they\xe2\x80\x99ve lost their accommodation in the private rent sector. Their houses are being repossessed, or they\xe2\x80\x99re being evicted because they\xe2\x80\x99re struggling with rent.\xe2\x80\x9d
Protests in Dublin are calling for rent control and more government housing. There have also been conflicts over forced evictions. Mr. Mac Namara says the government should build more social housing and tighten regulations to strengthen tenant rights.
Secret Street Tours is an effort to make a dent in the crisis. Co-founder Tom Austin came up with the idea after taking a similar tour in Vienna, and hearing what a difference it made in the life of his guide. He partnered with several co-founders and the Simon Community, another nonprofit working with the homeless. Mr. McGuire\xe2\x80\x99s tour is currently the only one the group offers, but Mr. Austin is working to add another this month and hopes to recruit as many as 10 guides to give tours throughout Dublin and Ireland. He acknowledges it\xe2\x80\x99s a small operation, but says he wants to make a \xe2\x80\x9cmassive impact\xe2\x80\x9d on those with whom they work. The tour costs 10 euros, and after the organization\xe2\x80\x99s small overhead, all proceeds go to the guides. Mr. McGuire receives a flat sum for each tour, while the rest of the money goes into a savings account for him.
Mr. McGuire developed the tour\xe2\x80\x99s itinerary himself, focusing on the history of the hardscrabble neighborhood that\xe2\x80\x99s home to the iconic Guinness brewery. He received training in public speaking through Secret Streets, and says he had to work on his confidence, though you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t realize it from the tour. His familiarity with the area lends authority and nuance, though he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t focus on his own experiences.
\xe2\x80\x9cEach of our tours will be unique, developed in partnership with the guide,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Austin. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re here about empowering them and giving them the skills to tell their own stories.\xe2\x80\x9d He also hopes to raise awareness and change perceptions. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see a lot of homeless people on the street but rarely interact and talk with them.... It\xe2\x80\x99s a way for people to engage, ask questions, to understand that ... anyone can lose a job, fall out of a relationship, fall behind on mortgage payments. Without the right support network, that can be anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d
For McGuire, it was a combination of such circumstances that led to him becoming homeless in 2014. It was a situation he\xe2\x80\x99d worked hard to leave behind. \xe2\x80\x9cI was born into homelessness,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s probably why this particular journey resonates so much to me. I was born into one of those hostels set up for single women,\xe2\x80\x9d one of which was a stop on the tour. \xe2\x80\x9cWe learned at a very young age about stigma, about carrying shame.\xe2\x80\x9d
But he went on to gain an education and worked for more than 20 years as an addiction counselor in a residential treatment center. He built a career, a life, and a family. When it all fell apart, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was all the more terrifying, because I was coming into homelessness from the perspective of having walked for many, many years with people who had gone through homelessness and addiction issues,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI was completely and totally broken.\xe2\x80\x9d
By the time Mr. Austin approached him to become Secret Street Tours\xe2\x80\x99 first guide, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cI had nothing to lose. I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt the shame, I\xe2\x80\x99ve carried the shame, I\xe2\x80\x99ve carried the guilt. I carried it like I carried the haversack on my back.\xe2\x80\x9d

He now lives in temporary accommodation provided by a charity, and has less than two years to figure out his next steps. Secret Street Tours is helping with that, he says.
The work has given him a feeling of \xe2\x80\x9cI can do this. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean just the tour, but life in general. The more I\xe2\x80\x99m doing this, it\xe2\x80\x99s connecting me with more people, and I have faith in my own abilities. I have a platform, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what Secret Street Tours offered me. And it\xe2\x80\x99s up to me about how I use it. I have a lot more ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d

A decade after the global financial crisis, Spain is still reckoning with millions of unoccupied and unfinished homes, relics of the pre-crisis housing boom. Yet more renters are facing the affordability crunch. Todos con Casa wants to help solve that with dignity instead of charity, Ms. S\xc3\xa1nchez says. And \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s also about generosity \xe2\x80\x93 we receive a lot and give a lot in return.\xe2\x80\x9d
In Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, Todos con Casa, or \xe2\x80\x9cA Home for All,\xe2\x80\x9d contracts landlords to accept rent that is lower than market rate while tenants and volunteers handle some maintenance and repairs. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell the homeowners this is first and foremost a solidarity network,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ms. S\xc3\xa1nchez. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s extremely important that the two parties meet and hear each other\xe2\x80\x99s story.\xe2\x80\x9d
When Victoria S\xc3\xa1nchez lost her job and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford the apartment she shared with her little girl, she knocked on doors and left notes in mailboxes, promising to fix up a place that needed some work \xe2\x80\x93 if only the rent was an affordable sum. One day, her persistence paid off, and Ms. S\xc3\xa1nchez was on her way to helping other eager tenants and landlords find each other.

Lots of children dream of their own bedroom. Ten-year-old Judith Rodr\xc3\xadguez\xe2\x80\x99s dreams centered on a different room of the house.
\xe2\x80\x9cWhen my daughter first visited the apartment and realized she was finally going to have a bathtub, she almost lost it with happiness,\xe2\x80\x9d says her mom, Mireya Rodr\xc3\xadguez. \xe2\x80\x9cA bathtub had always been her dream.\xe2\x80\x9d
It\xe2\x80\x99s the first time this single mother has been able to afford her own place. On a Tuesday morning, Ms. Rodr\xc3\xadguez is cleaning and arranging her spacious two-bedroom, which needs a coat of paint and some minor repairs. The upkeep is part of the deal with the landlord, who is accepting rent below market value, $136 per month, in exchange for fixing up the unit. Ms. Rodr\xc3\xadguez and volunteers from the nonprofit Todos con Casa, which brokered the deal, are ready to get down to work.
Todos con Casa, or \xe2\x80\x9cA Home for All,\xe2\x80\x9d links landlords with people in need of affordable housing. To Todos con Casa, there\xe2\x80\x99s a solidarity in the relationships they\xe2\x80\x99re creating \xe2\x80\x93 among landlords, their tenants, and the nonprofit which binds them \xe2\x80\x93 and a model that could help other communities. \xc2\xa0
According to a Eurostat report, 43% of Spaniards spent more than 40 percent of their earnings on rent in 2016, compared with an average of 28% in the European Union. In July, the government announced a plan to build 20,000 homes for social housing in four to six years. A decade after the global financial crisis, tourism-led gentrification, persistent high unemployment rates, and stagnant wages are accompanying a boom in rental prices. This is forcing tenants out of homes or making it difficult for some to afford an apartment. Nationally, millions of homes stand unoccupied and developments uncompleted, a vestige of the pre-crisis housing construction boom \xe2\x80\x93 even as the need for affordable housing grows.

When Spain\xe2\x80\x99s housing bubble burst 10 years ago, Victoria S\xc3\xa1nchez lost her job at a real estate agency in Valencia and could no longer afford the apartment in which she and her 8-year-old daughter lived. Ms. S\xc3\xa1nchez knocked on doors and left notes in mailboxes, promising to fix up someone\xe2\x80\x99s house if she could affordably rent it. One day, one note was answered.
Ms. S\xc3\xa1nchez got back on her feet and found a new job as a real estate agent in Jerez de la Frontera, her hometown. It looked as if she was picking up where she left off. Until she was forced to turn down a single mother as a client because she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a job contract.
\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I met that woman with a 3-year-old-baby, I saw myself in her. That moment changed my life,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. S\xc3\xa1nchez says.
Small group, making a big difference
Todos con Casa soon followed. When an acquaintance told her about an empty apartment, Ms. S\xc3\xa1nchez and some friends fixed it up and rented it to someone in need. Since 2015, Todos con Casa has renovated 16 apartments, helping single women, families with children, elderly people, and teenage Moroccan immigrants who had to leave shelters for unaccompanied minors when they turned 18. This month, the association will start working on three more empty houses. In Jerez de la Frontera, a city with the fifth highest unemployment rate in Spain, Todos con Casa tenants pay between $57 and $226, significantly below the average rental here, around $452.
\xe2\x80\x9cSome tenants tell me they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t slept in years,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. S\xc3\xa1nchez says. \xe2\x80\x9cBeing able to pay for their own place allows them to feel independent. They become more relaxed, they start looking for jobs with a newfound determination, their children look happy.\xe2\x80\x9d
While Todos con Casa\xe2\x80\x99s volunteers clean windows, examine electrical wiring, and measure the rooms of Ms. Rodr\xc3\xadguez\xe2\x80\x99s house, she meets her landlord for the first time, thanking him for the opportunity. The apartment belongs to Juan Antonio Palacios, a 42-year-old who moved back in with his parents after he became unemployed. Mr. Palacios reached out to Todos con Casa when his previous tenant didn\xe2\x80\x99t take proper care of the home.
\xe2\x80\x9cTodos con Casa is helping me and I\xe2\x80\x99m helping someone,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Palacios says.

\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t A decade ago, Victoria S\xc3\xa1nchez was jobless with a young child. She traded work on her own new apartment for a lower rent, and was inspired to found the nonprofit Todos con Casa so that other tenants could find similar affordable housing arrangements.

He signed a three-year transfer agreement. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the start, I tell the homeowners this is first and foremost a solidarity network,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ms. S\xc3\xa1nchez. \xe2\x80\x9cThen it becomes clear it\xe2\x80\x99s extremely important that the two parties meet and hear each other\xe2\x80\x99s story.\xe2\x80\x9d
A few landlords have benefited from a unique loophole: In Spain, homeowners on the verge of foreclosure may still rent their property to someone else while the bank has yet to assume ownership, a process that can take two or three years.
Less than a year ago, Todos con Casa received a grant from C\xc3\xa1diz provincial authorities, which allowed Ms. S\xc3\xa1nchez to get paid and to hire an assistant. The rest of the team is made of volunteers, all current or prospective tenants of Todos con Casa.
\xe2\x80\x9cI believe the biggest strength of Todos con Casa lies in the fact that tenants are also volunteers, fixing the houses where they\xe2\x80\x99re going to live or helping to fix the houses of other tenants. That brings a sense of dignity, instead of a feeling you owe people because of their charity. It\xe2\x80\x99s also about generosity \xe2\x80\x93 we receive a lot and give a lot in return,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ms. S\xc3\xa1nchez, who herself is a Todos con Casa tenant.
Occasionally, the landlords become volunteers as well, like Mr. Palacios. His father has also contacted the association to ask how he could help. And sometimes, homeowners will help tenants find jobs.
Avoiding evictions
Todos con Casa acts as an intermediary between tenant and homeowner, making sure the rent gets paid. That isn\xe2\x80\x99t always easy, Ms. S\xc3\xa1nchez explains, adding that the nonprofit does not evict tenants.
\xe2\x80\x9cI believe opportunities shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a limit. When something goes wrong, I sit with tenants and discuss what needs to change. Sometimes, the association pays the landlord in advance. I will never say to a tenant he needs to leave. It will be up to him to figure out he has exhausted all possibilities and can no longer keep the commitment,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. S\xc3\xa1nchez says.

In the last few months, Ms. S\xc3\xa1nchez has been contacting other housing organizations across Spain in the hope that similar initiatives can foster a national movement demanding change in the real estate and rental markets.
\xe2\x80\x9cFirst, homeowners lost their houses; now tenants can\xe2\x80\x99t find apartments. This needs to stop. I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with squatters, but if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for that movement [of protests after the 2008 crisis], Spain would be facing a civil war over housing right now. The government needs to protect the people the way associations like Todos con Casa is doing,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. S\xc3\xa1nchez says.

(TSX-V:EVX) (OTC PINK:EVXXF) ("EVX" or "Company") is pleased to report that the Company has received the renewal certificate of its mining license (“certificate) covering Rehova Copper Project. The certificate was issued on March 27, 2019 by the National Agency of Natural Resources (AKBN) of Albania. Its issuance signifies that the 25-year mining license of Rehova issued on February 9, 2017 is in good standing (see the Company filing on SEDAR).
Based on the results of drilling the Company conducted in 2018 and the geological modelling conducted by Wood Canada Limited, EVX believes there is potential for expanding the known mineralization in Rehova below the known mineralization as well as laterally (please refer to the Company’s website for the 2018 drilling results). With the certificate issued, the Company plans to conduct further drilling using geophysical tools such as ground magnetics and downhole TEM survey to confirm drill targets. Downhole TEM survey have been successful in finding off-hole section and depth extensions of blind mineralization on other projects. Recent examples include the discovery of large massive sulphide lenses with this method in the Iberian Pyrite Belt both in Portugal (Semblana in the Neves Corvo camp) and in Spain (Deep Magdalena lens, East of Aguas Teñidas mine).
The plan to do further exploration is subject to the approval of the request by the Company to the licensing authorities to extend the exploration period within the license area for a period of three years. The Company is also planning to conduct exploration outside of the license area, subject to the acquisition of exploration grounds around it. The Company believes there is potential for finding separate deposits outside of the license area based on the presence of several VMS prospects, some of which intersected copper mineralization in previous drilling.
With the renewal of the Rehova license, the Company now has two advance properties it will be focusing on; the cobalt-rich Skroska nickel laterite mine and Rehova copper project.
About Rehova
Rehova is located 115 kilometers southeast of Tirana (200 km by road) and is on the electrical power grid. The property encompasses four historical volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits. The four known deposits, called Bregu i Geshtenjes (“BG”), Kanisqel, Ciflig and Dushku i Trashe (“DT”), comprise the Rehova copper mine complex, a historically producing mining operation which was operated by the Albanian state copper enterprise.
Prior to the start of production in 1980, the Albanian Geological Survey had defined combined mineralization in the four deposits of 3.43 million tonnes grading 2.17 per cent copper and by the time operations stopped in 1990, reported 2.87 million tonnes grading 2.14 per cent copper remaining. The majority of the remaining mineralization was reported as 2.09 million tonnes grading 2.15 per cent copper from BG, which was not mined and has exploration potential beyond the historic drilling. BG was being planned for mining when the state-run mining enterprise shut down its operations country-wide in the early 1990s. Ciflig and DT were mined by underground methods and Kanisqel by open pit and to a limited extent by underground. The materials mined were sent to a historic processing plant (no longer existing) nearby with an annual capacity of 60,000 tonnes per year.
The tonnage and grade estimates stated above are historic in nature and were obtained from the records at the Albanian Geological Survey. The estimate done, using Russian Style Polygon method, are roughly equivalent to the National Instrument 43-101 inferred category. No qualified person has done sufficient work to classify the historical estimates as current mineral resources. EVX considers the historical estimates relevant in guiding exploration efforts and planning although EVX is not treating the historical estimates as current mineral resources. EVX will need to undertake a comprehensive review of available data, including further drilling, to verify the historic estimates and classify them as current resources.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."


European researchers to drill for ancient Antarctic ice

\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — A group of 14 European scientific institutions plan to retrieve the world\'s oldest ice as part of research into past climate change.
The consortium led by the Germany-based Alfred Wegener Institute said Tuesday it has identified an area in Antarctica, nicknamed "Little Dome C," that should harbor ice as old as 1.5 million years.
So-called ice core measurements are crucial for scientists\' understanding of past climatic changes on Earth and the models they use to predict future global warming or cooling.
Current ice core measurements provide reliable data going back only about 800,000 years.
At a meeting in Vienna, the institutes said they spent the past three years working with American, Australian, Japanese and Russian colleagues using radar to determine the best possible site for drilling.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has left its policy promises and interest rates unchanged as it weighs looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
The ECB has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve in pausing the withdrawal of stimulus measures deployed over a decade to bounce back from the global financial crisis, as central bankers around the world ponder which way the economy is headed. The Fed has already started raising rates but has backed off plans for further rate increases in 2019.
The ECB\'s 25-member governing council was content to stand pat on Thursday, making no changes to its short policy statement. The bank took several steps to support the economy on March 7. Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.
The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4%, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year — if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3% for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8% from a peak of 12.1% in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3% from 3.5%.
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members — or those hoping to join — could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.
Of the 16 participating countries — Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia — 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

European court: Russia\'s house arrest of Navalny unlawful
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights ruled Tuesday that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
Navalny, a prominent opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed the ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities. It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 20,000 euros ($22,550) in damages.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict to the court\'s highest chamber.
It\'s the second time that the court has ruled against Russia in a matter of months. Last November, the court\'s highest chamber found that Russian authorities violated multiple human rights in detaining Navalny seven times from 2012 to 2014, and that two of the arrests were expressly aimed at "suppressing political pluralism."
It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 63,000 euros in damages, and called on Russia to fix legislation to "take due regard of the fundamental importance of the right to peaceful assembly."
Russia is obliged to carry out the court\'s rulings, which enforce the European Convention on Human Rights, but it has delayed implementing past rulings from the court and argued against them as encroaching on Russian judicial sovereignty.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.

1:50 p.m.
The European Central Bank has kept its policy promises, interest rates and stimulus settings unchanged as officials weigh looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a news conference Thursday, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more monetary stimulus in coming months. Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for an interest rate increase from the end of the year into next year.

BERLIN (AP) — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.

European researchers to drill for ancient Antarctic ice
BERLIN (AP) — A group of 14 European scientific institutions plan to retrieve the world\'s oldest ice as part of research into past climate change.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
The consortium led by the Germany-based Alfred Wegener Institute said Tuesday it has identified an area in Antarctica, nicknamed "Little Dome C," that should harbor ice as old as 1.5 million years.
So-called ice core measurements are crucial for scientists\' understanding of past climatic changes on Earth and the models they use to predict future global warming or cooling.
Current ice core measurements provide reliable data going back only about 800,000 years.
At a meeting in Vienna, the institutes said they spent the past three years working with American, Australian, Japanese and Russian colleagues using radar to determine the best possible site for drilling.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries — the 8th so far — that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members — or those hoping to join — could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.
Of the 16 participating countries — Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia — 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.

DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) — China\'s prime minister has promised that Beijing will respect European standards and fair trade, seeking to allay concerns that it\'s flouting EU competition rules with huge investments on the continent.
Opening an annual summit of Eastern and Central European nations and China, Li Keqiang said "we intend to fully respect European standards."
Beijing has also been criticized for failing to give reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
He adds "we welcome openness and we want to treat all companies that operate in China equally and to increase imports from the (European) countries."
EU member Croatia is hosting a two-day summit between China and 16 regional countries on expanding business between China and the region, dubbed 16+1.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."

BERLIN (AP) — Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.


European court: Russia\'s house arrest of Navalny unlawful

MOSCOW (AP) — The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
Navalny, a leading opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed Tuesday\'s ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled Tuesday that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has left its policy promises and interest rates unchanged as it weighs looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
The ECB has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve in pausing the withdrawal of stimulus measures deployed over a decade to bounce back from the global financial crisis, as central bankers around the world ponder which way the economy is headed. The Fed has already started raising rates but has backed off plans for further rate increases in 2019.
The ECB\'s 25-member governing council was content to stand pat on Thursday, making no changes to its short policy statement. The bank took several steps to support the economy on March 7. Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.
The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4%, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year — if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3% for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8% from a peak of 12.1% in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3% from 3.5%.
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.

CHINESE Premier Li Keqiang will travel to Europe today for a series of high-level meetings to consolidate China-Europe cooperation at a time of uncertainty.
\r
\r
The visit, which will last till Friday, will take Li to Brussels for an annual gathering with European Union leaders, and to Croatia for an official visit and a leaders’ meeting of China and Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC).
\r
\r
“We believe that this meeting will take the China-EU dialogue and cooperation to a new level, and strengthen the stability, reciprocity and strategic significance of our relations,” said Zhang Ming, head of the Chinese Mission to the EU.
\r
\r
At the time of the visit, Brexit uncertainty is looming large over Europe.
\r
\r
EU leaders are scheduled to hold an emergency summit on Wednesday to decide whether to give Britain more time to leave the regional bloc, only two days after Li’s arrival.
\r
\r
Li is expected to send a message in support of European integration process, as well as the EU’s unity and growth, said Wang Yiwei, a professor with the Institute of International Affairs of Renmin University.
\r
\r
Leaders of the two sides will exchange views on bilateral ties and international and regional issues of concern, and witness the signing of cooperation documents covering energy, competition policies and other areas, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wang Chao said.
\r
\r
China and the EU are enjoying a sound development of ties, close high-level connections, deepening cooperation and robust people-to-people exchanges, the senior diplomat noted.
\r
\r
In the ninth round of the China-EU High-Level Strategic Dialogue last month, China and the EU reached “Ten-point Consensus,” which upholds multilateralism and supports an open world economy.
\r
\r
“The global significance of China-EU relations is becoming prominent,” said Zhang.
\r
\r
Beijing values its comprehensive strategic partnership with Brussels. Fostering a sound relationship with the EU has long been a priority of its foreign policy.
\r
\r
The EU has been China’s largest trading partner for 15 years in a row and China has become the EU’s second-largest trading partner, according to China’s Ministry of Commerce.
\r
\r
Official statistics from the ministry show that two-way trade between China and the EU hit a record high of US$682.2 billion in 2018, up 10.6 percent year on year.
\r
\r
The two sides are also building up consensus and efforts under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, achieving fruitful results.
\r
\r
Cooperation between China and the EU will result in more opportunities, especially given China’s recently adopted unified foreign investment law.
\r
\r
This is landmark legislation that will provide stronger protection and a better business environment for overseas investors.
\r
\r
“Despite mounting uncertainties in global trade, trade between China and Europe continues to enjoy good momentum,” said Cui Hongjian, head of the Department for European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, a Chinese think tank.
\r
\r
This year’s China-CEEC leaders’ meeting will be held in the Croatian city of Dubrovnik.
\r
\r
Initiated in 2012, the mechanism has gained wide support from the 16 CEEC countries, and has knitted together an all-round and multi-tiered cooperation framework.
\r
\r
In recent years, China-CEEC cooperation has been adapting to the constantly changing environment in Europe, and moving forward productively within the framework of China-EU relations and in accordance with rules of the EU, said Cui.
\r
\r
According to China’s commerce ministry, Chinese enterprises have so far invested more than US$10 billion in the 16 CEEC countries.
\r
\r
Cooperation in areas such as transportation, energy and production capacity has yielded fruitful results.
\r
\r
Statistics from China’s General Administration of Customs show that the trade volume between China and the 16 CEEC countries reached US$82.23 billion in 2018, marking a 21 percent growth year on year.
\r
\r
In addition, China and the CEEC countries focused on closer sub-national cooperation last year, and achieved significant progress in such areas as economy and trade, science and technology, education as well as people-to-people exchanges.
\r
\r
The annual gathering is of great significance to promoting steady, long-term development of China-CEEC cooperation as well as China-EU relations, said Wang Chao.
\r
\r
Zhang added: “Spring is unfolding early in Brussels. China-EU relations are also breathing in fresh spring air.”
