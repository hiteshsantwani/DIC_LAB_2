PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.


France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
10:15 a.m.
Julian Assange\'s mother has taken to Twitter to call on authorities to be gentle with her son, who\'s jailed in London after his removal from the Ecuadorian Embassy.
Christine Assange\'s tweets on Friday say Assange had been deprived of fresh air, exercise and medical care. "Please be patient, gentle & kind to him" she asked of police and court personnel.
The WikiLeaks founder is an Australia native, and the government said he would receive consular help due to its citizens after he was arrested on a U.S. conspiracy charge. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the expected battle over Assange\'s possible extradition would not involve Australia.
___
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."
___
9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.
___
8:45 a.m.
A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.

Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.
Da Costa wrote: "No worries, a tongue slip happens, he works too much. beIN SPORTS, stop mid-week games please."

UK, US, and France warn Syria not to use chemical weapons
WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.

ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.
"The key for us is to remain grouped together," Macron said. "We have a European renaissance to lead. We don\'t want the Brexit problem to block us on this point."
In the end, the EU leaders hammered out a compromise — giving May more time than Macron wanted to give her to steer a departure deal through her country\'s bitterly divided parliament, while simultaneously shaving months off Tusk\'s suggestion.
As Wednesday night ebbed into the wee hours of Thursday, Macron stood his ground, insisting on a shorter delay than Tusk and most other EU nations wanted. May had requested pushing the Brexit deadline back to June 30, but did not object to a longer delay.
Leaders ultimately coalesced around Oct. 31 — Halloween — as the latest Brexit deadline, averting a potentially disruptive no-deal British departure that would have happened Friday if no extension had been agreed.
"We had a very intensive debate," was how German Chancellor Angela Merkel characterized the summit.
Hanging tough in Brussels could also pay domestic political dividends for Macron, projecting strength at a time when he is weakened by yellow vest protesters at home.
"There seem to be those who think it is good politics for Macron at home to stand up to the British," said Anand Menon, professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at Kings College London and Director of the UK in a Changing Europe Initiative. "One of the things that certainly seems to have happened is that he annoyed a lot of people in Brussels last night by what many saw as his unnecessary theatrics."
A senior EU official at the talks acknowledged that it was "a difficult moment" but said the atmosphere remained constructive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the talks.
While May now has until Oct. 31 to find backing for her unloved Brexit withdrawal deal, Britain could still leave earlier if talks with the country\'s opposition Labour Party find a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament.
"I continue to believe we need to leave the EU, with a deal, as soon as possible," May told reporters.
Manfred Weber, a German who leads the biggest group in the European Parliament, said Europe showed "patience and unity" in avoiding a damaging no-deal Brexit. But he added that "the political uncertainty in London has been extended, which risks affecting debates about the future of Europe."
Germany\'s Spiegel Online called the early-morning agreement a "classic Brussels compromise."
"The EU retained its unity on Brexit — albeit only just," it said.
The British press compared the latest Brexit machinations to Wednesday\'s other big news — the publication of the first-ever photograph of a black hole.
"Here\'s another inescapable black hole," The Times wrote under the photo, referencing Britain\'s Brexit impasse.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.

PARIS (AP) — The beIN Sports television network and commentator Daniel Bravo have apologized after Bravo described Strasbourg striker Nuno Da Costa\'s statistics as "not bad for a black."
Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.
Da Costa wrote: "No worries, a tongue slip happens, he works too much. beIN SPORTS, stop mid-week games please."

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
10:15 a.m.
Julian Assange\'s mother has taken to Twitter to call on authorities to be gentle with her son, who\'s jailed in London after his removal from the Ecuadorian Embassy.
Christine Assange\'s tweets on Friday say Assange had been deprived of fresh air, exercise and medical care. "Please be patient, gentle & kind to him" she asked of police and court personnel.
The WikiLeaks founder is an Australia native, and the government said he would receive consular help due to its citizens after he was arrested on a U.S. conspiracy charge. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the expected battle over Assange\'s possible extradition would not involve Australia.
___
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."


France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."

Former France midfielder Florent Malouda fired on Twitter
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."

9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.
___
8:45 a.m.
A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."


UK, US, and France warn Syria not to use chemical weapons

WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.

Trade unionists and Yellow Vests are set to march together this Saturday to defend the right to protest against vicious assaults from president Emmanuel Macron’s government.
\r
\r
The CGT union federation said, “Faced with the proliferation of repression and the criminalisation of social movements, it is essential to remain mobilised in large numbers for the defence of public freedoms”.
\r
\r
According to figures compiled by journalist Philippe Dufresne, police assaults have caused at least 200 head injuries, blinded 22 people in one eye and torn five hands apart.
\r
\r
A police inquiry report last week revealed that during Yellow Vest protests in January in Saint-Etienne, a 14 year old refugee lost an eye when hit by a police flashball.
\r
\r
Last weekend, the 21st successive Saturday of protests saw smaller numbers than the week before. But still tens of thousands took to the streets.
\r
\r
Marched
\r
\r
There were major protests in Paris, Lille, Toulouse, Bordeaux and other areas.
\r
\r
Yellow Vests and CGT union members marched together in Rouen to defy a police ban on demonstrations in certain areas.
\r
\r
The unity of organised workers and Yellow Vests is needed to beat Macron. But union leaders are only half-hearted in building it.
\r
\r
A teachers’ strike last week saw widespread support with parents, school students and strikers marching together in some areas.
\r
\r
In another sign of progress, the second assembly of Yellow Vest representatives gathered in Saint-Nazaire last weekend to coordinate activity.
\r
\r
The first assembly at the end of January brought together 75 delegations. This time 200 delegations joined the Assembly of Assemblies.
\r
\r
Each delegation was chosen by its local Yellow Vest group and over 700 people gathered, representing about 10,000 Yellow Vests according to the organisers. It is not yet a democratic national gathering, but it points towards it.
The declaration of the assembly of the assemblies - ‘Don't look at us, join us’
\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
We Yellow Vests, formed in local assemblies, gathered in Saint-Nazaire, 5, 6, 7 April 2019, address the people as a whole. Following the first meeting of Commercy, approximately 200 delegations present continue their fight against liberal extremism, for freedom, equality and fraternity.
\r
\r
Despite the government’s escalating repression, the accumulation of laws that worsen everyone’s living conditions and destroy rights and freedoms, mobilisation is taking root to change the system embodied by Macron.
\r
\r
The government’s only answer to the movement embodied by the Yellow Vests and other movements of struggle, is to panic and oppose the movement in an authoritarian way.
\r
\r
For five months everywhere in France—on roundabouts, car parks, squares, tolls, in demonstrations and in our assemblies—we continue to debate and fight against all forms of inequality and injustice and for solidarity and dignity.
\r
\r
We demand a general increase of wages, pensions and benefits, as well as public services for all. Our struggling solidarity goes especially to the 9 million people living below the poverty line. Aware of the environmental emergency, we say, end of the world, end of the month, same logic, same fight. [See note below]
\r
\r
Faced with the charade of [Macron’s] “great debate”, in the face of a non-representative government which serves a privileged minority, we are setting up new forms of direct democracy.
\r
\r
Concretely, we recognize that the assembly of the assemblies can receive propositions from local assemblies, and to give guidelines as did the first assembly of the assemblies in Commercy. These guidelines are then systematically submitted to local groups. The assembly of assemblies reaffirms its independence from political parties, trade unions and recognises no self-appointed leader.
\r
\r
\r
\r
For three days, in plenary and workshop groups, we all debated and elaborated proposals for our demands, actions, means of communication and coordination. We are committed to the long term and decide to hold a future Assembly of Assemblies in June.
\r
\r
In order to strengthen the balance of power, to put the citizens into battle against this system, the assembly of assemblies calls for actions whose schedule will be diffused soon by means of a digital platform.
\r
\r
The assembly of assemblies calls for expanding and strengthening sovereign and new citizen assemblies. We call on all Yellow Vests to spread this call and the conclusions of the work of our assembly.
\r
\r
The results of the work done in plenary will feed the actions and reflections of the assemblies.
\r
\r
We make several calls, on the Europeans, the local people's congregations, against the repression and for the cancellation of the sentences of the prisoners and convicts of the movement.
\r
\r
It seems necessary to take three weeks to mobilize all the Yellow Vests and convince those who are not yet ready.
\r
\r
We call for a Yellow Week of action from 1 May.
\r
\r
We invite all those who want to put an end to our lives being taken away from us to join the conflict against the current system and to create together, by all necessary means, a new social, ecological and popular movement. The multiplication of current struggles calls us to seek unity in action.
\r
\r
We call on all levels of the territory to fight collectively to achieve the satisfaction of our social, fiscal, ecological and democratic demands.
\r
\r
Aware that we have to fight against a global system, we consider that it will be necessary to leave capitalism. So we will collectively build the famous "all together" that we are chanting and making everything possible. We are all building together at all levels of the territory.
\r
\r
Do not look at us, join us. The power of the people, by the people, for the people.
Note the phrase “end of the world, end of the month” is common among the Yellow Vests. It says the battle to eke out wages to the “end of the month” can’t be divorced from the battle to save the environment.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
\t
10:15 a.m.
\t
Julian Assange\'s mother has taken to Twitter to call on authorities to be gentle with her son, who\'s jailed in London after his removal from the Ecuadorian Embassy.
\t
\t
Christine Assange\'s tweets on Friday say Assange had been deprived of fresh air, exercise and medical care. "Please be patient, gentle & kind to him" she asked of police and court personnel.
\t
\t
The WikiLeaks founder is an Australia native, and the government said he would receive consular help due to its citizens after he was arrested on a U.S. conspiracy charge. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the expected battle over Assange\'s possible extradition would not involve Australia.
\t
___
\t
9:45 a.m.
\t
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
\t
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
\t
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
\t
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
\t
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
\t
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
\t
\t
___
\t
9 a.m.
\t
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
\t
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
\t
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
\t
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
\t
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."


\t
ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
\t
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
\t
\t
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
\t
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
\t
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
\t
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
\t
\t
\t
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
\t
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.


\t
BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
\t
\t
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
\t
\t
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.
\t
"The key for us is to remain grouped together," Macron said. "We have a European renaissance to lead. We don\'t want the Brexit problem to block us on this point."
\t
In the end, the EU leaders hammered out a compromise — giving May more time than Macron wanted to give her to steer a departure deal through her country\'s bitterly divided parliament, while simultaneously shaving months off Tusk\'s suggestion.
\t
As Wednesday night ebbed into the wee hours of Thursday, Macron stood his ground, insisting on a shorter delay than Tusk and most other EU nations wanted. May had requested pushing the Brexit deadline back to June 30, but did not object to a longer delay.
\t
Leaders ultimately coalesced around Oct. 31 — Halloween — as the latest Brexit deadline, averting a potentially disruptive no-deal British departure that would have happened Friday if no extension had been agreed.
\t
"We had a very intensive debate," was how German Chancellor Angela Merkel characterized the summit.
\t
\t
Hanging tough in Brussels could also pay domestic political dividends for Macron, projecting strength at a time when he is weakened by yellow vest protesters at home.
\t
"There seem to be those who think it is good politics for Macron at home to stand up to the British," said Anand Menon, professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at Kings College London and Director of the UK in a Changing Europe Initiative. "One of the things that certainly seems to have happened is that he annoyed a lot of people in Brussels last night by what many saw as his unnecessary theatrics."
\t
A senior EU official at the talks acknowledged that it was "a difficult moment" but said the atmosphere remained constructive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the talks.
\t
While May now has until Oct. 31 to find backing for her unloved Brexit withdrawal deal, Britain could still leave earlier if talks with the country\'s opposition Labour Party find a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament.
\t
"I continue to believe we need to leave the EU, with a deal, as soon as possible," May told reporters.
\t
Manfred Weber, a German who leads the biggest group in the European Parliament, said Europe showed "patience and unity" in avoiding a damaging no-deal Brexit. But he added that "the political uncertainty in London has been extended, which risks affecting debates about the future of Europe."
\t
Germany\'s Spiegel Online called the early-morning agreement a "classic Brussels compromise."
\t
"The EU retained its unity on Brexit — albeit only just," it said.
\t
The British press compared the latest Brexit machinations to Wednesday\'s other big news — the publication of the first-ever photograph of a black hole.
\t
\t
"Here\'s another inescapable black hole," The Times wrote under the photo, referencing Britain\'s Brexit impasse.

\t
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
\t
\t
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
\t
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
\t
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
\t
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
\t
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
\t
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
\t
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
\t
\t
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
\t
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
\t
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
\t
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
\t
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
\t
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
\t
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."


Security on agenda of G-7 meetings in France
\t
PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
\t
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
\t
\t
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
\t
\t
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
\t
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.


\t
PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
\t
\t
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
\t
\t
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
\t
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
\t
\t
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
\t
\t
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
\t
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
\t
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
\t
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
\t
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
\t
\t
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
\t
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
\t
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
\t
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
\t
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
\t
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
\t
\t
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
\t
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
\t
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
\t
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
\t
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
\t
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
\t
\t
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
\t
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
\t
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
\t
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.
"The key for us is to remain grouped together," Macron said. "We have a European renaissance to lead. We don\'t want the Brexit problem to block us on this point."
In the end, the EU leaders hammered out a compromise — giving May more time than Macron wanted to give her to steer a departure deal through her country\'s bitterly divided parliament, while simultaneously shaving months off Tusk\'s suggestion.
As Wednesday night ebbed into the wee hours of Thursday, Macron stood his ground, insisting on a shorter delay than Tusk and most other EU nations wanted. May had requested pushing the Brexit deadline back to June 30, but did not object to a longer delay.
Leaders ultimately coalesced around Oct. 31 — Halloween — as the latest Brexit deadline, averting a potentially disruptive no-deal British departure that would have happened Friday if no extension had been agreed.
"We had a very intensive debate," was how German Chancellor Angela Merkel characterized the summit.
Hanging tough in Brussels could also pay domestic political dividends for Macron, projecting strength at a time when he is weakened by yellow vest protesters at home.
"There seem to be those who think it is good politics for Macron at home to stand up to the British," said Anand Menon, professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at Kings College London and Director of the UK in a Changing Europe Initiative. "One of the things that certainly seems to have happened is that he annoyed a lot of people in Brussels last night by what many saw as his unnecessary theatrics."
A senior EU official at the talks acknowledged that it was "a difficult moment" but said the atmosphere remained constructive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the talks.
While May now has until Oct. 31 to find backing for her unloved Brexit withdrawal deal, Britain could still leave earlier if talks with the country\'s opposition Labour Party find a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament.
"I continue to believe we need to leave the EU, with a deal, as soon as possible," May told reporters.
Manfred Weber, a German who leads the biggest group in the European Parliament, said Europe showed "patience and unity" in avoiding a damaging no-deal Brexit. But he added that "the political uncertainty in London has been extended, which risks affecting debates about the future of Europe."
Germany\'s Spiegel Online called the early-morning agreement a "classic Brussels compromise."
"The EU retained its unity on Brexit — albeit only just," it said.
The British press compared the latest Brexit machinations to Wednesday\'s other big news — the publication of the first-ever photograph of a black hole.
"Here\'s another inescapable black hole," The Times wrote under the photo, referencing Britain\'s Brexit impasse.

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.

Chef du jour
Francesco d’Amuri, chef and owner
L’Orcio, 806 State St., New Haven
203-777-6670
http://www.lorcio.com
Husband and wife owners Francesco d’Amuri, 45, and Alison De Renzi, 41.
Type of food prepared: Italian
Background/education: Alison studied art history at NYU; Francesco, on-the-job restaurant experience
1. When did the restaurant open?
February 11, 2003.
2. What made you decide to become a restaurant chef/owner?
My wife, Alison. It was an opportunity for us to work together and build a life in the United States. Alison was studying in Italy when we met.
3. What is meaning of the name of the restaurant?
It is a terra cotta urn used for holding olive oil or olives. It dates back to the Etruscan times but is still used today. It is like our food: traditional yet current, rustic and earthy.
4. How did your interest in food and cooking begin?
I was born in Francavilla Fontana, Brindisi in Italy. As a son of farmers I grew up deeply connected to the land my parents worked and to the bounties it yielded. As a child I helped my parents harvest olives to make olive oil, pressing grapes for family wine, canning and pickling the seasonal crops and preparing all they grew to share together at the family table. A love of Italian food was in my blood and it came as no surprise when I started to hone my skills and make a living cooking. I officially began my culinary career in the summer resorts of Rimini and fell in love with the busy kitchen life. I worked in Arezzo, Cortona and Rome, which exposed me to different types of Italian cuisine. When called to serve mandatory military service in Florence, I found it hard to keep out of the kitchen and soon found myself cooking in the officers’ canteen. After finishing service, I worked at five-star hotels in Florence and with Florence’s premier caterer Ciabatti.
5. Who was your culinary mentor?
Tony Dilena, who owned a group of hotels in the Riviera Romagnola. I was staying at one of his hotels on vacation in Rimini with my friends and didn’t want to leave so I got a job there as a dishwasher. The job offered room and board and enough cash to have some fun after work and extend my vacation. Tony was very supportive. When I told him I didn’t like washing dishes he let me tend bar. When I told him that bartending wasn’t for me, he let me to serve guests. When I realized I preferred to be in the back of the house he let me back into the kitchen and I began to do more food prep and cooking since I had a knack for it. I actually returned the following summer and ran the kitchen at one of his smaller properties when their chef bailed on them at the beginning of the season. After that I traveled and worked with his family at some of their other venues in Rome and Grosetto. He saw that I was a hard worker and believed in me and taught me a lot about the business during all of the summers I worked for him, which were quite a few! He also gave me the space to hone my skills and find my way. He was a great man!
6. What did you do before opening L’Orcio?
We were living in Florence and I owned a wood finishing shop. Alison worked for a company and was teaching business English for companies like Citibank, Pepsi and Alexander McQueen that were in preparation for the start of the European Union.
7. What is your secret in keeping customers coming back?
Working hard for them everyday and providing them with the best possible experience for their hard-earned money.
8. What do you feel is the next big trend in dining?
Who knows, we don’t really follow trends. The one thing we know that will never get old is wanting good quality, delicious food.
9. What’s the most memorable meal you have ever eaten and where was it and who was there?
Grotta Palazzese in Polignano a Mare, Puglia. I was with my parents and my father-in-law last summer dining in a natural cave overlooking the Adriatic Sea. I had one of the most memorable seafood dishes I’ve ever had. It was amazing to share that with my parents and I am looking forward to taking my wife and daughters there this summer.
10. What’s the most memorable meal you have ever prepared?
When my wife and I made pizza in our wood-burning pizza oven in our back yard. I built the oven with my dad and brother, and whenever we do that I feel really connected to my family. My wife and kids always comment, “smells like Italy,” and it is always a wonderfully fulfilling ritual.
11. Is there anything else you can share about yourself, your career or the profession that would be interesting or helpful to others who would like to open a restaurant?
Travel and work for different people. Keep your eyes and ears open. ... There’s a lot to learn from the world around you.
11. What are 3 tips for running a successful restaurant?
Work, work, work
12. What are your future plans for L’Orcio?
Continue to provide the quality of service and food our customers have come to expect from us.
13. When you’re at home or someone else cooks for you, do people feel pressured to cook you something fancy because you own a restaurant?
Some people feel that way, but it’s not necessary. When someone prepares food for you it is always a sign of great hospitality and I am always thankful for that.
14. Besides your own restaurant what are some of your favorites?
We like to eat out and enjoy types of food we don’t make at home. We always love dining at Olea. Other favorites are Saray Turkish restaurant and Siam Orchids Thai restaurant where we had our staff holiday party this year. We also really enjoy driving up to the Matunuk Oyster Bar, they have outstanding food and amazing oysters. As a family we are still mourning the loss of our beloved Thali!
15. What do you want your restaurant to be known for? (What will people remember your restaurant for and return to it for?)
Our handmade pastas are always a hit and I know that many people have jumped on the homemade pasta bandwagon but we make about 9 types daily, most of which are worked by hand not by machine. In general I think people that really know food and have traveled really appreciate the quality and variety that we offer. They appreciate that we make their food, not assemble it.
16. What dish is your signature dish and why is it that particular dish?
I would say it’s Pappardelle al Ragu because that is our all-time number one selling dish. Obviously, the hand-rolled and cut pappardelle are unique and nobody is going to make ragu’ the same. I think people really appreciate the richness in flavor of ours, and its complexity, while also being so straightforward and simple. Italian food is about masterfully combining simple ingredients to obtain those results and I think this dish in particular can highlight that mastery or expose a lack of it.
17. What do you think when you hear someone say: “I think owning a restaurant looks like fun.”
You mean after we stop laughing?
18. What five words describe your restaurant?
Hard-working, humble, delicious, unique, welcoming.
19. In a nutshell, what is your philosophy on food and dining?
Respect your ingredients, respect your customers.
20. Where do you go to relax?
Our beautiful home.
21. My cabinet has room for only three condiments or spices. What should they be?
Extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, vinegar
22. Surely you are inundated with compliments on your cooking. What’s the most memorable and from whom, if you remember?
From my wife. We were living in Florence and had just met. I invited her to my house and made her lunch. She said it was one of the best meals she ever had.
23. My bookshelf has room for only three cookbooks. What should they be?
“Il Cucchiaio d’argento” (Silver Spoon); “Il Grande Libro Della Cucina Italiana” (The big book of Italian regional cuisine); Your little notebook that has all the scraps of papers and notecards of recipes you have collected over the years.
24. Imagine you had to prepare a meal for an old-school culinary master, like Julia Child or Jacques Pepin. What would you prepare?
If it were Jacques Pepin I would make him gnocchi because I know he really likes mine! I would prepare them with a red wine radicchio cream sauce.
25. When you are not cooking and running the kitchen, you have fun by ...?
Enjoying time with my family. I also love to go fishing and I enjoy driving.
26. Your favorite food as a child?
Melanzane Ripieni, It’s a specialty from my region. They are baby eggplant stuffed with meat and baked in a wood-burning oven. Whenever I go home to visit my family in Italy it is always ready and waiting for me!
27. What is your favorite ingredient?
My mom’s capers. She grows them and pickles them herself. They have such a unique flavor. My wife says they are magic and she demands a steady supply.
28. What do you like for a quick meal out?
Sushi.
29. What inspires you to get up and go to work every day?
My family.
30. What would you do if you weren’t a chef and restaurant owner?
An astronaut.
31. What is the biggest challenge in the restaurant business?
The weather.
32. What cooking tricks did your mother, grandmother or other food mentor teach you?
Never cut corners on your ingredients.
33. What is your favorite kitchen tool?
My chef knife.
34. What dish or ingredient will we never see you eating?
Tilapia, I would never cook it or eat it.
35. What is your favorite food city to visit?
Florence.
36. What is your favorite late-night snack?
My wife calls me the raccoon, so anything I can get my hands on.
37. What’s one must-have at your last supper?
A nice glass of red wine.
38. When you just want to prepare something simple, quick and delicious, what would you make?
Spaghetti al Pomodoro. Spaghetti with tomato sauce.
39. Rapid fire:
Ketchup or mustard? Ketchup.
Chocolate or vanilla? Chocolate.
Coffee or tea? Espresso.
Burger or hot dog? Burger.
40. What are some of your most memorable moments around the table?
Getting to meet Alison’s mother, grandmother and sister for the first time while eating out at one of our favorite restaurants in Florence. We didn’t know each other but it was fun to share a beautiful meal with them and get to see my future wife interact with her family for the first time.
41. How would you describe the current dining scene in Connecticut?
Vast and varied.
42. If you were giving a young person interested in a career like yours, some advice would be ...?
Be quiet and listen. Use all of your senses. Be open to the input of others. There is a lot to learn and you will continue learning throughout your career.
43. How it is working with your spouse?
It can be hard when sometimes you don’t want to share some of your work stresses with your spouse because it is their work place as well so there really isn’t that objective input that can be given because we are both involved. It can be challenging when we are navigating the back of the house and front of the house perspective on things. It is most challenging when we want to do things together with our family sometimes and it is extra challenging because it is hard for us to get time off together for extended vacations and fun stuff. But ultimately it is the only way we would be in this business because nobody has our backs like each other. Mostly we are proud to work with each other, we have done so for 16 years and are still happily married after 19 years!
44. Are there any special events you can tell readers about?
We will be participating in New Haven’s Restaurant Week, beginning April 7. I will be the featured chef at the C.O.O.K event at Gateway Community College on June 5. There is a reception prior to my cooking demonstration as well as a 3-course dinner. The price is $65 and tickets are available by calling 203-285-2617. Every Tuesday at the restaurant we offer “10 for Tuesdays” when all handmade pasta, gnocci and ravioli are $10.
45. What dish from your menu will you be making today to share with the readers?

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
10:15 a.m.
Julian Assange\'s mother has taken to Twitter to call on authorities to be gentle with her son, who\'s jailed in London after his removal from the Ecuadorian Embassy.
Christine Assange\'s tweets on Friday say Assange had been deprived of fresh air, exercise and medical care. "Please be patient, gentle & kind to him" she asked of police and court personnel.
The WikiLeaks founder is an Australia native, and the government said he would receive consular help due to its citizens after he was arrested on a U.S. conspiracy charge. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the expected battle over Assange\'s possible extradition would not involve Australia.
___
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.


France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."
___
9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.
___
8:45 a.m.
A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."


Former France midfielder Florent Malouda fired on Twitter
ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

UK, US, and France warn Syria not to use chemical weapons
WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.


Former France player apologizes for racist remark on TV
PARIS (AP) — The beIN Sports television network and commentator Daniel Bravo have apologized after Bravo described Strasbourg striker Nuno Da Costa\'s statistics as "not bad for a black."
Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.
Da Costa wrote: "No worries, a tongue slip happens, he works too much. beIN SPORTS, stop mid-week games please."

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.


French President Emmanuel Macron has appointed a panel of experts to investigate France\'s role in Rwanda\'s genocide 25 years ago.
An estimated 800,000 Rwandans, most from the minority Tutsi community, were killed by ethnic Hutu extremists over 100 days in 1994.
Rwanda has accused France of complicity in the mass killings - a charge repeatedly denied by Paris.
ARCHIVES
The experts will now consult archives to analyse France\'s role.
They will have access to presidential, diplomatic, military and intelligence archives, Mr Macron\'s office said in a statement.
Julien Allaire of Survie, a Paris-based NGO that focuses on relations between France and Africa, told the BBC that there was already ample evidence of "France\'s diplomatic, military and economic support for the Rwandan government before, during and after the genocide".
In 2015, then-President Francois Hollande announced that the Rwanda archives would be declassified but two years later, after a researcher sought permission to study them, France\'s Constitutional Council ruled that they should remain secret.
The constitution says papers deposited in the archives by a president or minister can remain secret for 25 years after that person\'s death. The president at the time of the genocide, Francois Mitterrand, died in 1996.
REPORT
Looking at the period from 1990 to 1994, it is hoped that the findings made by the eight historians and researchers will "contribute to a better understanding and knowledge" of what happened, the presidency said.
"The goal is to deliver a report which will be published in two years\' time... and will be accessible to all," it added.
France was a close ally of the Hutu-led government of Juvenal Habyarimana prior to the massacres.
It was the shooting down of his plane over the capital Kigali in April 1994 that triggered the genocide.
Rwanda has accused France of ignoring or missing warning signs and of training the militias who carried out the attacks.
It also says French forces, stationed there as part of a UN peacekeeping operation, used the creation of a safe zone to help some of the perpetrators to escape.
The issue has long strained relations between the two countries, though they have improved over the past decade.
But no French president has ever attended the annual commemorations in Rwanda. Mr Macron turned down an invitation for this weekend\'s events, citing scheduling problems.

SAO PAOLO
Football great Pele arrived back in Brazil Tuesday after receiving treatment for a urinary tract infection during a six-day hospital stay in France.
The three-time World Cup winner was discharged late Monday from the private American hospital in the Paris suburbs where he had been taken after falling ill following an appearance at a promotional event with France striker Kylian Mbappe.
After arriving at the Sao Paulo-Guarulhos airport in Brazil, the 78-year-old was taken through the terminal in a wheelchair and was driven away in a van.
"Once again, thank God, everything went well. I\'m alive. Long live Brazil," Pele said after he arrived.
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the Brazilians and all those who called the hospital, who called me, for my operation, to wish me a rapid recovery," he added.

Relief as Brazil football legend Pele leaves hospital
In a statement on Monday on the Globoesporte.com site, Pele said his condition had required "medical assistance and surgery" but gave no further details.
Before he was discharged, current Brazil star Neymar, who plays alongside Mbappe for Paris Saint-Germain, paid him a visit at the hospital.
Neymar posted a photo on his Instagram account Monday of himself next to a smiling Pele in his hospital bed with the two holding hands.
Brazil\'s G1 reported that Pele had intended to come out of hospital on Saturday to return to his home country, but had been delayed by further tests.
The infection was not serious and was under control, members of Pele\'s entourage had said.
Pele has had several health scares in recent years.
A similar infection put him in intensive care in November 2014.
In 2016, Pele, who played 1,363 professional matches, scoring 1,281 goals, was unable to light the flame at the Rio Olympics because of severe pain in the hip.
In January 2018, he cancelled a trip to London fearing a "stressful" and "tiring" journey.

Former France player apologizes for racist remark on TV
PARIS (AP) — The beIN Sports television network and commentator Daniel Bravo have apologized after Bravo described Strasbourg striker Nuno Da Costa\'s statistics as "not bad for a black."
Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.
Da Costa wrote: "No worries, a tongue slip happens, he works too much. beIN SPORTS, stop mid-week games please."

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.
"The key for us is to remain grouped together," Macron said. "We have a European renaissance to lead. We don\'t want the Brexit problem to block us on this point."
In the end, the EU leaders hammered out a compromise — giving May more time than Macron wanted to give her to steer a departure deal through her country\'s bitterly divided parliament, while simultaneously shaving months off Tusk\'s suggestion.
As Wednesday night ebbed into the wee hours of Thursday, Macron stood his ground, insisting on a shorter delay than Tusk and most other EU nations wanted. May had requested pushing the Brexit deadline back to June 30, but did not object to a longer delay.
Leaders ultimately coalesced around Oct. 31 — Halloween — as the latest Brexit deadline, averting a potentially disruptive no-deal British departure that would have happened Friday if no extension had been agreed.
"We had a very intensive debate," was how German Chancellor Angela Merkel characterized the summit.
Hanging tough in Brussels could also pay domestic political dividends for Macron, projecting strength at a time when he is weakened by yellow vest protesters at home.
"There seem to be those who think it is good politics for Macron at home to stand up to the British," said Anand Menon, professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at Kings College London and Director of the UK in a Changing Europe Initiative. "One of the things that certainly seems to have happened is that he annoyed a lot of people in Brussels last night by what many saw as his unnecessary theatrics."
A senior EU official at the talks acknowledged that it was "a difficult moment" but said the atmosphere remained constructive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the talks.
While May now has until Oct. 31 to find backing for her unloved Brexit withdrawal deal, Britain could still leave earlier if talks with the country\'s opposition Labour Party find a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament.
"I continue to believe we need to leave the EU, with a deal, as soon as possible," May told reporters.
Manfred Weber, a German who leads the biggest group in the European Parliament, said Europe showed "patience and unity" in avoiding a damaging no-deal Brexit. But he added that "the political uncertainty in London has been extended, which risks affecting debates about the future of Europe."
Germany\'s Spiegel Online called the early-morning agreement a "classic Brussels compromise."
"The EU retained its unity on Brexit — albeit only just," it said.
The British press compared the latest Brexit machinations to Wednesday\'s other big news — the publication of the first-ever photograph of a black hole.
"Here\'s another inescapable black hole," The Times wrote under the photo, referencing Britain\'s Brexit impasse.

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.


UK, US, and France warn Syria not to use chemical weapons
WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.


Former France midfielder Florent Malouda fired on Twitter
ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye" caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France, switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah.
He says living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, and has no plans to move even as the show takes off.

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."
___
9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.
___
8:45 a.m.
A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."


France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
\r
\t\t \r

\r
\t\r
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.

PARIS (AP) — The beIN Sports television network and commentator Daniel Bravo have apologized after Bravo described Strasbourg striker Nuno Da Costa\'s statistics as "not bad for a black."
Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.
Da Costa wrote: "No worries, a tongue slip happens, he works too much. beIN SPORTS, stop mid-week games please."

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."
___
9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.
___
8:45 a.m.
A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.


UK, US, and France warn Syria not to use chemical weapons
WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.

The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."
___
9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.
___
8:45 a.m.
A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.
"The key for us is to remain grouped together," Macron said. "We have a European renaissance to lead. We don\'t want the Brexit problem to block us on this point."
In the end, the EU leaders hammered out a compromise — giving May more time than Macron wanted to give her to steer a departure deal through her country\'s bitterly divided parliament, while simultaneously shaving months off Tusk\'s suggestion.
As Wednesday night ebbed into the wee hours of Thursday, Macron stood his ground, insisting on a shorter delay than Tusk and most other EU nations wanted. May had requested pushing the Brexit deadline back to June 30, but did not object to a longer delay.
Leaders ultimately coalesced around Oct. 31 — Halloween — as the latest Brexit deadline, averting a potentially disruptive no-deal British departure that would have happened Friday if no extension had been agreed.
"We had a very intensive debate," was how German Chancellor Angela Merkel characterized the summit.
Hanging tough in Brussels could also pay domestic political dividends for Macron, projecting strength at a time when he is weakened by yellow vest protesters at home.
"There seem to be those who think it is good politics for Macron at home to stand up to the British," said Anand Menon, professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at Kings College London and Director of the UK in a Changing Europe Initiative. "One of the things that certainly seems to have happened is that he annoyed a lot of people in Brussels last night by what many saw as his unnecessary theatrics."
A senior EU official at the talks acknowledged that it was "a difficult moment" but said the atmosphere remained constructive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the talks.
While May now has until Oct. 31 to find backing for her unloved Brexit withdrawal deal, Britain could still leave earlier if talks with the country\'s opposition Labour Party find a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament.
"I continue to believe we need to leave the EU, with a deal, as soon as possible," May told reporters.
Manfred Weber, a German who leads the biggest group in the European Parliament, said Europe showed "patience and unity" in avoiding a damaging no-deal Brexit. But he added that "the political uncertainty in London has been extended, which risks affecting debates about the future of Europe."
Germany\'s Spiegel Online called the early-morning agreement a "classic Brussels compromise."
"The EU retained its unity on Brexit — albeit only just," it said.
The British press compared the latest Brexit machinations to Wednesday\'s other big news — the publication of the first-ever photograph of a black hole.
"Here\'s another inescapable black hole," The Times wrote under the photo, referencing Britain\'s Brexit impasse.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
10:15 a.m.
Julian Assange\'s mother has taken to Twitter to call on authorities to be gentle with her son, who\'s jailed in London after his removal from the Ecuadorian Embassy.
Christine Assange\'s tweets on Friday say Assange had been deprived of fresh air, exercise and medical care. "Please be patient, gentle & kind to him" she asked of police and court personnel.
The WikiLeaks founder is an Australia native, and the government said he would receive consular help due to its citizens after he was arrested on a U.S. conspiracy charge. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the expected battle over Assange\'s possible extradition would not involve Australia.
___
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.

PARIS (AP) — The beIN Sports television network and commentator Daniel Bravo have apologized after Bravo described Strasbourg striker Nuno Da Costa\'s statistics as "not bad for a black."
Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.
Da Costa wrote: "No worries, a tongue slip happens, he works too much. beIN SPORTS, stop mid-week games please."

The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.


Former France midfielder Florent Malouda fired on Twitter

\t\r
ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.


France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."

VALDOSTA, Ga. (WCTV) -- A Valdosta World War II veteran has been bestowed France\'s highest award, the French Legion of Honor, on Thursday.
\r
\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t
The day was decades in the making for George Aigen and his family. All throughout the ceremony, there was not a dry eye in the house.

\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t
It takes a special kind of person to bring together so many people who all came to show their love, support and appreciation for his service.

\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t
"One of the most incredible days of my life," said Aigen\'s daughter, Judy Hathcock. "It just filled my soul and gave me so much meaning and purpose."

Bulgarians working in France were attacked and beaten because of fake news.\xc2\xa0Kristian Ivanov and Kiril Avramov from the village of Davidovo of Targovishte have been attacked by a large group of people while sleeping in their minibus with which they collect waste from non-ferrous metals, NOVA points out.
\xc2\xa0
The reason for this was false information that Bulgarians kidnap children to sell them for organs.
\xc2\xa0
"They attacked me with metal rims for wheels, stones, bricks, pipes," said\xc2\xa0Kristian Ivanov.
\xc2\xa0
"They swore and yelled:" Get off the bus, child thieves! The attack continued 15-20 minutes , "said Kiril Avramov.
\xc2\xa0
The two men were rescued by another resident of the village of Davidovo - Mitko Dimitrov, who saw the assailants:
\r
\xc2\xa0
"I saw\xc2\xa0a lot of people were beating them. Two buses were broken and there was a brutal violence, I drove in their direction so the people spread and saved the two men, "he said.
\xc2\xa0
Men say they are living by collecting and sorting waste in the French neighborhoods. They live outdoors in their minibuses for weeks. At the end of March, however, there is a hearing about kidnapped children in Paris.
\xc2\xa0
"We are innocent, we do not know what it is about. We were in stress, "Avramov added.
\xc2\xa0
From the village of Davidovo insist that Bulgaria\'s foreign ministry should ask the French authorities to investigate the case.
\xc2\xa0
For its part, the police prefecture in Paris issued a message on social networks, which confirms that the news of kidnapping is fake news.


Five people living at the La Cheneraie retirement home in Lherm, a town in southern France, died as a result of a food poisoning on Sunday evening. The deceased, which included four women and a man, were aged between 72 and 95.
According to AFP, 22 people initially began showing symptoms, which included vomiting, at the home following dinner. About a dozen others remain in serious condition and are currently being treated at a nearby hospital.
Deputy Prosecutor Marie-Paule Demiguel told BFM Television that investigators suspected food poisoning since "these events occurred after the meal." Presently, both the home\'s kitchen and the meals served Sunday are being reviewed for further analysis.
The home\'s management company, Korian, released a statement clarifying that all meals are produced onsite with its own kitchen staff. However, Alain Lepeyere, the son of one of the women who died, found out from the resident physician at the facility that the meal in question had been delivered from elsewhere, he told AFP. He also expressed frustration at the management, as the monthly cost of housing someone at the home was approximately $3,360.
The granddaughter of one of the deceased individuals also told French newspaper Depeche du Midi that her grandmother had been served a Perigord salad that included duck, ham and foie gras.
"I still have the menu in my handbag and I know they had Perigord salad last night," she told the publication. "What could that mean? Could it be the foie gras? They\'re going to do an autopsy in any case."
Others with relatives at the retirement home have suggested that the "problem was with meals prepared specially for palliative care patients."
The retirement home facility opened in 2006, and was purchased by Korian, a private provider that claims to be the largest network of retirement homes in Europe, in February of this year. Following the incident, shares in the Korian fell by 9 percent, the biggest slump since February 2018.

Former France player apologizes for racist remark on TV
PARIS (AP) — The beIN Sports television network and commentator Daniel Bravo have apologized after Bravo described Strasbourg striker Nuno Da Costa\'s statistics as "not bad for a black."
Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.
"The key for us is to remain grouped together," Macron said. "We have a European renaissance to lead. We don\'t want the Brexit problem to block us on this point."
In the end, the EU leaders hammered out a compromise — giving May more time than Macron wanted to give her to steer a departure deal through her country\'s bitterly divided parliament, while simultaneously shaving months off Tusk\'s suggestion.
As Wednesday night ebbed into the wee hours of Thursday, Macron stood his ground, insisting on a shorter delay than Tusk and most other EU nations wanted. May had requested pushing the Brexit deadline back to June 30, but did not object to a longer delay.
Leaders ultimately coalesced around Oct. 31 — Halloween — as the latest Brexit deadline, averting a potentially disruptive no-deal British departure that would have happened Friday if no extension had been agreed.
"We had a very intensive debate," was how German Chancellor Angela Merkel characterized the summit.
Hanging tough in Brussels could also pay domestic political dividends for Macron, projecting strength at a time when he is weakened by yellow vest protesters at home.
"There seem to be those who think it is good politics for Macron at home to stand up to the British," said Anand Menon, professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at Kings College London and Director of the UK in a Changing Europe Initiative. "One of the things that certainly seems to have happened is that he annoyed a lot of people in Brussels last night by what many saw as his unnecessary theatrics."
A senior EU official at the talks acknowledged that it was "a difficult moment" but said the atmosphere remained constructive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the talks.
While May now has until Oct. 31 to find backing for her unloved Brexit withdrawal deal, Britain could still leave earlier if talks with the country\'s opposition Labour Party find a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament.
"I continue to believe we need to leave the EU, with a deal, as soon as possible," May told reporters.
Manfred Weber, a German who leads the biggest group in the European Parliament, said Europe showed "patience and unity" in avoiding a damaging no-deal Brexit. But he added that "the political uncertainty in London has been extended, which risks affecting debates about the future of Europe."
Germany\'s Spiegel Online called the early-morning agreement a "classic Brussels compromise."
"The EU retained its unity on Brexit — albeit only just," it said.
The British press compared the latest Brexit machinations to Wednesday\'s other big news — the publication of the first-ever photograph of a black hole.
"Here\'s another inescapable black hole," The Times wrote under the photo, referencing Britain\'s Brexit impasse.

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."
___

France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."


Former France midfielder Florent Malouda fired on Twitter
ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.

The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
10:15 a.m.
Julian Assange\'s mother has taken to Twitter to call on authorities to be gentle with her son, who\'s jailed in London after his removal from the Ecuadorian Embassy.
Christine Assange\'s tweets on Friday say Assange had been deprived of fresh air, exercise and medical care. "Please be patient, gentle & kind to him" she asked of police and court personnel.
The WikiLeaks founder is an Australia native, and the government said he would receive consular help due to its citizens after he was arrested on a U.S. conspiracy charge. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the expected battle over Assange\'s possible extradition would not involve Australia.
___
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.


UK, US, and France warn Syria not to use chemical weapons
WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."

Italy\'s Salvini, France\'s Le Pen cement ties before EU vote

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.


Former France player apologizes for racist remark on TV
PARIS (AP) — The beIN Sports television network and commentator Daniel Bravo have apologized after Bravo described Strasbourg striker Nuno Da Costa\'s statistics as "not bad for a black."
Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.
Da Costa wrote: "No worries, a tongue slip happens, he works too much. beIN SPORTS, stop mid-week games please."

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.


France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.
"The key for us is to remain grouped together," Macron said. "We have a European renaissance to lead. We don\'t want the Brexit problem to block us on this point."
In the end, the EU leaders hammered out a compromise — giving May more time than Macron wanted to give her to steer a departure deal through her country\'s bitterly divided parliament, while simultaneously shaving months off Tusk\'s suggestion.
As Wednesday night ebbed into the wee hours of Thursday, Macron stood his ground, insisting on a shorter delay than Tusk and most other EU nations wanted. May had requested pushing the Brexit deadline back to June 30, but did not object to a longer delay.
Leaders ultimately coalesced around Oct. 31 — Halloween — as the latest Brexit deadline, averting a potentially disruptive no-deal British departure that would have happened Friday if no extension had been agreed.
"We had a very intensive debate," was how German Chancellor Angela Merkel characterized the summit.
Hanging tough in Brussels could also pay domestic political dividends for Macron, projecting strength at a time when he is weakened by yellow vest protesters at home.
"There seem to be those who think it is good politics for Macron at home to stand up to the British," said Anand Menon, professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at Kings College London and Director of the UK in a Changing Europe Initiative. "One of the things that certainly seems to have happened is that he annoyed a lot of people in Brussels last night by what many saw as his unnecessary theatrics."
A senior EU official at the talks acknowledged that it was "a difficult moment" but said the atmosphere remained constructive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the talks.
While May now has until Oct. 31 to find backing for her unloved Brexit withdrawal deal, Britain could still leave earlier if talks with the country\'s opposition Labour Party find a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament.
"I continue to believe we need to leave the EU, with a deal, as soon as possible," May told reporters.
Manfred Weber, a German who leads the biggest group in the European Parliament, said Europe showed "patience and unity" in avoiding a damaging no-deal Brexit. But he added that "the political uncertainty in London has been extended, which risks affecting debates about the future of Europe."
Germany\'s Spiegel Online called the early-morning agreement a "classic Brussels compromise."
"The EU retained its unity on Brexit — albeit only just," it said.
The British press compared the latest Brexit machinations to Wednesday\'s other big news — the publication of the first-ever photograph of a black hole.
"Here\'s another inescapable black hole," The Times wrote under the photo, referencing Britain\'s Brexit impasse.

UK, US, and France warn Syria not to use chemical weapons
WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye" caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France, switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah.
He says living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, and has no plans to move even as the show takes off.


British Prime Minister Theresa May will travel to Berlin and Paris on Tuesday, hoping to strike a deal for an extension, avoiding a "no-deal Brexit" on Friday. Photo by Hugo Philpott/UPI | License Photo
April 8 (UPI) -- British Prime Minister Theresa May travels Tuesday to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel as she works to extend the deadline for leaving the European Union.
Britain is scheduled to have a "no deal Brexit" from the European Union on Friday. May wants to push it back to June 30 but leave open the possibility of an early exit if her deal can get through Parliament before then. She\'s tried three times to pass a deal through Parliament this year without success.
May has previously asked for a June 30 extension but was told she could have until May 22.
In a video posted to social media Sunday, May said she doesn\'t think Parliament will accept another withdrawal agreement but lawmakers also won\'t accept a no-deal Brexit. She said the government would try a "new approach" through cross-party talks. This would involve "compromise on both sides, but I believe that delivering Brexit is the most important thing for us," she said.
Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said "everyone is hoping" Brexit talks continue. The "ball is in the government\'s court" and there hasn\'t been a "change of position."
The biggest dispute has to do with imported goods -- Labor leaders want a free flow of goods into the country but Brexit supporters want to negotiate new trade deals without being bound by the EU and its tariffs.
Solicitor General Robert Buckland told BBC Radio 4 that a customs union wouldn\'t mean an end to freedom of movement and it accomplishes the majority of the goals of Brexit. A customs union is the "most likely outcome."
RELATED British PM asks EU to delay Brexit deadline to June 30
"It\'s not perfect but, frankly, in this particular hung Parliament none of us can get perfection, we need to compromise," Buckland said.
Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson wrote a column in the Daily Telegraph urging Tory lawmakers not let May "surrender" to Labor\'s demands.
"If the UK were to commit to remaining in the customs union, it would make a total and utter nonsense of the referendum result," Johnson said.

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."
___
9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.
___
8:45 a.m.
A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
10:15 a.m.
Julian Assange\'s mother has taken to Twitter to call on authorities to be gentle with her son, who\'s jailed in London after his removal from the Ecuadorian Embassy.
Christine Assange\'s tweets on Friday say Assange had been deprived of fresh air, exercise and medical care. "Please be patient, gentle & kind to him" she asked of police and court personnel.
The WikiLeaks founder is an Australia native, and the government said he would receive consular help due to its citizens after he was arrested on a U.S. conspiracy charge. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the expected battle over Assange\'s possible extradition would not involve Australia.
___
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."


France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.
"The key for us is to remain grouped together," Macron said. "We have a European renaissance to lead. We don\'t want the Brexit problem to block us on this point."
In the end, the EU leaders hammered out a compromise — giving May more time than Macron wanted to give her to steer a departure deal through her country\'s bitterly divided parliament, while simultaneously shaving months off Tusk\'s suggestion.
As Wednesday night ebbed into the wee hours of Thursday, Macron stood his ground, insisting on a shorter delay than Tusk and most other EU nations wanted. May had requested pushing the Brexit deadline back to June 30, but did not object to a longer delay.
Leaders ultimately coalesced around Oct. 31 — Halloween — as the latest Brexit deadline, averting a potentially disruptive no-deal British departure that would have happened Friday if no extension had been agreed.
"We had a very intensive debate," was how German Chancellor Angela Merkel characterized the summit.
Hanging tough in Brussels could also pay domestic political dividends for Macron, projecting strength at a time when he is weakened by yellow vest protesters at home.
"There seem to be those who think it is good politics for Macron at home to stand up to the British," said Anand Menon, professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at Kings College London and Director of the UK in a Changing Europe Initiative. "One of the things that certainly seems to have happened is that he annoyed a lot of people in Brussels last night by what many saw as his unnecessary theatrics."
A senior EU official at the talks acknowledged that it was "a difficult moment" but said the atmosphere remained constructive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the talks.
While May now has until Oct. 31 to find backing for her unloved Brexit withdrawal deal, Britain could still leave earlier if talks with the country\'s opposition Labour Party find a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament.
"I continue to believe we need to leave the EU, with a deal, as soon as possible," May told reporters.
Manfred Weber, a German who leads the biggest group in the European Parliament, said Europe showed "patience and unity" in avoiding a damaging no-deal Brexit. But he added that "the political uncertainty in London has been extended, which risks affecting debates about the future of Europe."
Germany\'s Spiegel Online called the early-morning agreement a "classic Brussels compromise."
"The EU retained its unity on Brexit — albeit only just," it said.
The British press compared the latest Brexit machinations to Wednesday\'s other big news — the publication of the first-ever photograph of a black hole.
"Here\'s another inescapable black hole," The Times wrote under the photo, referencing Britain\'s Brexit impasse.

Former France player apologizes for racist remark on TV
PARIS (AP) — The beIN Sports television network and commentator Daniel Bravo have apologized after Bravo described Strasbourg striker Nuno Da Costa\'s statistics as "not bad for a black."
Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.
Da Costa wrote: "No worries, a tongue slip happens, he works too much. beIN SPORTS, stop mid-week games please."

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.


Former France midfielder Florent Malouda fired on Twitter
ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."


UK, US, and France warn Syria not to use chemical weapons
WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.


More than a dozen people have been arrested as Yellow Vest protesters flood the streets of French cities, marking the 21st consecutive week of mass demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron and his government.
Some 21 protesters were arrested in Paris on Saturday morning, local media reported, citing police. Eric Drouet, one of the leaders of the Yellow Vests, was fined 135 euro ($150) for violating public protest laws. The ruling was slammed by his lawyer who said that "if Drouet wants to have a cup of coffee at the Champs-Elysees, he has an absolute right to do so."
Nevertheless, the rallies in the French capital and elsewhere remain largely peaceful. The Yellow Vests are singing songs and holding placards as they march to denounce the policies of Emmanuel Macron and demand his resignation.
The rallies were met with an increased police presence. Videos from the scene showed the crowd booing police motorcades.
The authorities upheld the ban on demonstrations in some places, including the iconic Avenue des Champs-Elysees, as well as the areas surrounding the parliament and the president\'s residence at the Elysee Palace. Similar bans were placed in a number of other cities.
Two rallies were authorized in Paris. The protesters have occupied downtown Place de la Republique from where they plan to march all the way up to the La Defense business district. A separate group of Yellow Vests, gathering at Montparnasse Boulevard, is expected to march to one of the city\'s largest parks, Parc de la Villette.
Minor scuffles with police officers were reported in the northern city of Rouen where thousands of protesters are marching.
The Yellow Vests emerged in November as a grassroots movement against the planned fuel tax hikes. It gradually grew into nationwide protests against the elites and perceived low living standards.
On several occasions, the rallies turned into fierce street battles with police in Paris and other cities. The upheaval led President Macron to scrap the fuel tax hike and offer other concessions. At the same time, he refused to fulfill some of the protesters\' other demands, such as reinstating the wealth tax.

Germany and France have announced the creation of a new \'Alliance for Multilateralism\' to support international cooperation and the UN. Is it a much-needed step to counterbalance the US, or a reaction to the excesses of Trump?
On the one hand you could say it\'s a sign of Europe\'s biggest powers finally showing some teeth to the US.
As cited in Deutsche Welle, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the first objective would be to show that countries that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world." US President Donald Trump wasn\'t mentioned by name, and while both he and his German counterpart Heiko Maas stressed that the initiative wasn\'t directed against America, it was clear when Le Drian talked about the "consequences of unilateralism and isolationism" who he was really referring to.
The American president has pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal, calling it "an embarrassment" and the US has threatened secondary sanctions on countries like Germany, who continue to trade with the Islamic Republic. Trump has cut US funding for the UN, and withdrawn from the UN Human Rights Council, UNESCO and the Paris Climate Agreement - and recognised Israel\'s claims to the Golan Heights.
It\'s clear too that many of the world\'s leading problems, whether we\'re talking climate change, organised crime, terrorism, protecting endangered wildlife and saving the world\'s oceans, can only be solved through an international, multilateral approach. We need international institutions which are respected and we need binding international agreements. Acknowledging this does not make one a \'globalist\'.
Back in 1999, when we had a Democrat president, France and Germany joined in the illegal NATO attack on Yugoslavia , which did not have UNSC authorisation and was even in breach of NATO\'s own constitution. France too played a leading role in the destruction of Libya (which again took place under a Democratic Party president) and against all the diplomatic norms, recognised the Syrian rebel \'National Coalition\' as the "sole representative of the Syrian people" in November 2012, even though it was highly debatable as to whether the rebels even had majority support in the country.
France has also been carrying out illegal air strikes on Syria. In December, France said it would stay in Syria, even after the US left. "For now of course we remain in Syria," said European Affairs Minister Nathalie Loiseau. How\'s that for imperial arrogance?
Le Drian and Maas stressed that members of the \'Alliance for Multilateralism\' would be expected to commit to a rules-based international order. That surely means the countries ending all illegal operations within Syria, otherwise the hypocrisy is there for all to see.
Venezuela also comes into the equation.
A genuine return to a rules-based international order, would mean all the countries of the world, big or small, agreeing to respect the charter of the United Nations.
So yes, the \'Alliance for Multilateralism\', in as much as it shows Europe implied criticism of the US, is to be given cautious support.
But the leading protagonists need to start practicing what they preach before we start to pop the champagne corks.

She\'s back and capitalizing on Emmanuel Macron\'s failures to address the Yellow Vest protests.
A couple months ago, when he was still the rising star of a new generation of EU enthusiasts, France\'s "centrist" president Emmanuel Macron was expected to turn European politics around. Back then, the only people pointing out the potential negative consequences of his administration were libertarians, of which there aren\'t many in France, and conservatives, who are still bemoaning their electoral failure in 2017.
As a result of Brexit, France has gained an additional five seats while Germany\'s count remains the same. Seventy-nine seats could potentially drive a wedge through the myriad political groups of the European Parliament and drastically alter the political priorities of the legislature.
Current polling These data reveal that Macron\'s party is currently performing better than he is in the polls, which is likely related to the fact that he is trying to delegate campaigning to other party officials while he deals with the fallout of the Yellow Vests movement.
And what fallout it has been: with an approval rating hovering around the 29 percent mark and protests still ongoing, Macron\'s reform plans for Europe are increasingly falling on deaf ears. Back in December, German European Commissioner G\xc3\xbcnther \xc3\x96ttinger said thatWith Angela Merkel\'s successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, making herself known to the public,
Kramp-Karrenbauer surprisingly came out on top of the leadership election of the CDU (the center-right party that Merkel belongs to), winning against the more conservative Friedrich Merz. She now needs to consolidate both the centrist and the right-wing parts of her party. She began to do the latter byKramp-Karrenbauer responded by suggesting that France give its seat on the UN Security Council to the EU, as well as centralize the European Parliament in Brussels rather than keeping it partially in Strasbourg. It was a bitingly sarcastic response-both proposals have been opposed in France for some time.
What to make of all this? Macron is losing standing and respect in Europe.
Le Pen really doesn\'t need to do much to benefit from the present situation. At first, she attempted to influence the Yellow Vests, but ultimately realized that her aims were better served by letting the movement remain apolitical.
Both groups have had their manpower and substance sucked away by En Marche and are now clinging to the remnants of their movements. The Socialist Party is polling around 5 percent and the Republicans between 12 and 13 percent. Both are contending with MPs jumping ship to join Macron while simultaneously struggling with breakaway parties and movements.
With the two-party system destroyed, voters have been left with a limited selection of candidates. At this point,
Le Pen, for her part, is following her strategy of the last decade: speaking at rallies, using terrorist threats to bolster her anti-immigration platform, and occasionally causing controversy. On the latter note, she recently faced criminal charges for tweeting out graphic images of ISIS killings .
We already know this becauseas did his socialist predecessor, Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande. Those who were on the verge of voting for Marine Le Pen a few years ago will now have heard every slander to which her party has been been exposed, and won\'t be impressed by it. Unfortunately, the economic problems that Le Pen\'s policies would result in aren\'t being expounded upon. Instead, she is being attacked for her alleged racism. While some of her policies are indeed discriminatory, that argument simply doesn\'t stick with voters, who are more interested in purchasing power and political accountability.
The European elections have little impact on French politics, but they are indicative of a trend that could soon sweep the R\xc3\xa9publique and land the establishment in serious trouble. That will mean a lot for the presidential election in 2022.

France has ruled out the repatriation of French extremists and their families detained in Syria after the fall of ISIS’ “caliphate”, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said Friday.
France and other European nations have been wrestling with how to handle the hundreds of foreign fighters, many of whom are being held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces which led the final push against ISIS.
French daily Liberation reported Friday that in early March the government had been ready to bring home around 250 men, women, and children before abandoning the plan given public hostility to the repatriations.
The issue is extremely sensitive in France, where a deadly 2015 attack on the capital claimed by ISIS killed 130 people and set off a wave of other deadly assaults since then.
“It’s logical that our services considered all hypotheses. This was one of the hypothesis they prepared,” Castaner said at a press conference following a meeting of G7 interior ministers in Paris.
“No communal repatriation was under consideration to be carried out,” he said, reiterating that France would nonetheless study bringing back children of extremist fighters on a “case-by-case basis.”
He denied Liberation’s claim that France’s policy with regards to fighters in Syria was being dictated by public opinion.
Last month, French authorities for the first time brought home five orphaned children of French extremists from camps in northeast Syria.
According to the UN children’s agency UNICEF, around 3,000 foreign children from 43 countries are housed at the al-Hol camp in Syria alone, which has taken in most of the people fleeing ISIS’ self-proclaimed “caliphate” in recent weeks.
Up to 1,700 French nationals are thought to have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight with the extremists between 2014 and 2018, according to government figures. Around 300 are believed to have died in combat.
Kurdish officials have warned they do not have the resources to hold all the captured fighters indefinitely, and Washington is also urging its allies in the anti-ISIS coalition to take home their citizens.
But repatriation is a politically fraught issue, and governments fear they may not have enough evidence to convict ISIS members who claim they did not fight.

France and Germany on Tuesday announced an initiative to bolster multilateralism, warning that the rules-based order embodied by such organizations as the United Nations was under threat of unraveling.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and his German counterpart Heiko Maas will officially launch the Alliance for Multilateralism in September during the annual General Assembly meeting of world leaders.
The move comes as the United States under President Donald Trump is cutting funding to the United Nations, withdrawing from international agreements and shunning cooperation on key issues like climate.
The US retreat has given China an opportunity to advance its agenda, while Russia has set up parallel tracks in Syria, for instance, that have sidelined UN efforts.
“Confronted with the risk of deconstruction of our multilateral edifice, France and Germany are convinced that they can convey a message together,” Le Drian told a news conference.
“We are in a good position to show to the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism, and enabling nationalist and extremist speech to flourish.”
Aside from the European powers, Canada and Japan are expected to join, along with possibly Australia, India, Indonesia and Mexico, according to diplomats.
The foreign ministers stressed that the alliance was not directed against the United States.
“We don’t want to lock out anyone,” said Maas. “Of course, we would be happy if the United States were to join such an initiative.”
But the German foreign minister said alliance members must commit to a rules-based international order.

Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven nations broadly agreed on issues during a two-day meeting, but were unable to bridge differences on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and how to deal with Iran, France’s Foreign Minister said on Saturday.
“Despite the crisp air of Dinard, we couldn’t overcome some of our differences,” Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said at the end of a two-day meeting in western France.
He added: “I think the talks were constructive and pleasant both in tone and in the fundamentals.”
Le Drian, whose country has been criticised for supporting Libyan eastern commander Khalifa Haftar, said rival factions in Libya needed to hold back and that Haftar should accept a UN-backed peace effort.

Britain, France and Germany are accusing Iran of developing missile technology, following recent activities, that they said was inconsistent with a UN resolution, and are calling for a full UN report, according to a letter released on Tuesday.
The European trio cited Iran’s launch of a space vehicle and the unveiling of two new ballistic missiles in February as forming “part of trend of increased activity inconsistent” with the resolution, according to the letter sent to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.
UN Security Council Resolution 2231 -- adopted just after the 2015 nuclear deal -- calls on Iran “not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons.”

Tehran insists that its missile program is defensive and that it has no intention of developing a nuclear capability.
The three countries asked Guterres to “report fully and throughly on Iranian ballistic missile activity” in his next report, which is expected in June.
The letter from the European countries, which are signatories to the nuclear deal along with the United States and Russia, came nearly a month after the United States made a similar appeal to the council, saying it was time to bring back tougher international restrictions on Tehran.
Sanctions reimposed
President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the nuclear accord in May last year and reimposed sanctions on Iran, citing concerns about missile development among its reasons.
ALSO READ: Iran dismisses EU concern about missile tests as ‘non-constructive’
At a council meeting in December, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for tighter restrictions on Iran to curb its missile program but Russia flatly asserted that there was no proof that Iran’s missiles can carry a nuclear payload.
The European countries said the Safir space launch vehicle used for a satellite blastoff on February 6 is based on two other missiles and uses technology closely related to the development of long-range and intercontinental ballistic missiles.

On February 7, the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards unveiled the Dezful surface-to-surface missile which they claimed had a range of 1,000 kilometers, according to the letter sent on March 25.
During a public display in Tehran on February 4, Iran revealed a variant of the Khorramshahr ballistic missile that the letter said was “potentially an intermediate-range ballistic missile.”
Iran reined in most of its nuclear program under the landmark nuclear deal with major powers but has kept up development of its ballistic missile technology.

The French government must implement bold tax cuts, the prime minister said on Monday, after a mass public consultation was called in the wake of “yellow vest” protests that shook President Emmanuel Macron.
Giving the first conclusions of a “Great National Debate” which was launched in January in response to the protests, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said French citizens had expressed “an enormous exasperation” over the heavy tax burden.
“The debates show us very clearly which way to go. We need to lower taxes, and lower them more quickly,” he told an audience in Paris.
The “yellow vest” protests, so called for the fluorescent vests worn by demonstrators, began in mid-November initially over fuel taxes before morphing into a nation-wide revolt against Macron.
The 41-year-old centrist came to power in May 2017 promising pro-business reforms and he has focused his tax cuts so far on companies and high-earners in a bid to increase investment and lower unemployment.
The president is expected to announce new policies in a major speech planned in the middle of the month.
The “Great National Debate” involved 10,000 meetings in community halls around the country, around two million online contributions and saw Macron join local events for nearly 100 hours in total.
As well as lower taxes, Philippe said that several other themes which had emerged during the consultation, which was designed to draw the anger out of the “yellow vest” protest movement.
Citizens wanted a more direct say in the running of the country -- so-called “participatory democracy” -- and action to combat climate change.
“We have reached a point where hesitating would be worse than an error, it would be an offense,” Philippe added. “The need for change is so radical that any conservatism, any feebleness would be unforgivable in my view.”
France has the highest taxation rate in the developed world, according to the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
10:15 a.m.
Julian Assange\'s mother has taken to Twitter to call on authorities to be gentle with her son, who\'s jailed in London after his removal from the Ecuadorian Embassy.
Christine Assange\'s tweets on Friday say Assange had been deprived of fresh air, exercise and medical care. "Please be patient, gentle & kind to him" she asked of police and court personnel.
The WikiLeaks founder is an Australia native, and the government said he would receive consular help due to its citizens after he was arrested on a U.S. conspiracy charge. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the expected battle over Assange\'s possible extradition would not involve Australia.
___
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.
"The key for us is to remain grouped together," Macron said. "We have a European renaissance to lead. We don\'t want the Brexit problem to block us on this point."
In the end, the EU leaders hammered out a compromise — giving May more time than Macron wanted to give her to steer a departure deal through her country\'s bitterly divided parliament, while simultaneously shaving months off Tusk\'s suggestion.
As Wednesday night ebbed into the wee hours of Thursday, Macron stood his ground, insisting on a shorter delay than Tusk and most other EU nations wanted. May had requested pushing the Brexit deadline back to June 30, but did not object to a longer delay.
Leaders ultimately coalesced around Oct. 31 — Halloween — as the latest Brexit deadline, averting a potentially disruptive no-deal British departure that would have happened Friday if no extension had been agreed.
"We had a very intensive debate," was how German Chancellor Angela Merkel characterized the summit.
Hanging tough in Brussels could also pay domestic political dividends for Macron, projecting strength at a time when he is weakened by yellow vest protesters at home.
"There seem to be those who think it is good politics for Macron at home to stand up to the British," said Anand Menon, professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at Kings College London and Director of the UK in a Changing Europe Initiative. "One of the things that certainly seems to have happened is that he annoyed a lot of people in Brussels last night by what many saw as his unnecessary theatrics."
A senior EU official at the talks acknowledged that it was "a difficult moment" but said the atmosphere remained constructive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the talks.
While May now has until Oct. 31 to find backing for her unloved Brexit withdrawal deal, Britain could still leave earlier if talks with the country\'s opposition Labour Party find a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament.
"I continue to believe we need to leave the EU, with a deal, as soon as possible," May told reporters.
Manfred Weber, a German who leads the biggest group in the European Parliament, said Europe showed "patience and unity" in avoiding a damaging no-deal Brexit. But he added that "the political uncertainty in London has been extended, which risks affecting debates about the future of Europe."
Germany\'s Spiegel Online called the early-morning agreement a "classic Brussels compromise."
"The EU retained its unity on Brexit — albeit only just," it said.
The British press compared the latest Brexit machinations to Wednesday\'s other big news — the publication of the first-ever photograph of a black hole.
"Here\'s another inescapable black hole," The Times wrote under the photo, referencing Britain\'s Brexit impasse.

UK, US, and France warn Syria not to use chemical weapons
WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.


Former France player apologizes for racist remark on TV
PARIS (AP) — The beIN Sports television network and commentator Daniel Bravo have apologized after Bravo described Strasbourg striker Nuno Da Costa\'s statistics as "not bad for a black."
Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.
Da Costa wrote: "No worries, a tongue slip happens, he works too much. beIN SPORTS, stop mid-week games please."

ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.


France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."
___
9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.
___
8:45 a.m.
A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
10:15 a.m.
Julian Assange\'s mother has taken to Twitter to call on authorities to be gentle with her son, who\'s jailed in London after his removal from the Ecuadorian Embassy.
Christine Assange\'s tweets on Friday say Assange had been deprived of fresh air, exercise and medical care. "Please be patient, gentle & kind to him" she asked of police and court personnel.
The WikiLeaks founder is an Australia native, and the government said he would receive consular help due to its citizens after he was arrested on a U.S. conspiracy charge. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the expected battle over Assange\'s possible extradition would not involve Australia.
___
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."

9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.
___
8:45 a.m.
A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.


France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."


UK, US, and France warn Syria not to use chemical weapons
WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."

A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
\t
\t
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
\t
\t
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
\t
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."

\t
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
\t
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
\t
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.

A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
\t
\t
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
\t
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
\t
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."

ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
\t
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
\t
\t
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
\t
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
\t
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

Security on agenda of G-7 meetings in France
\t
PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
\t
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
\t
\t
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
\t
\t
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
\t
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.


\t
WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
\t
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
\t
\t
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
\t
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
\t
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.


\t
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
\t
\t
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
\t
\t
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
\t
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
\t
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
\t
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
\t
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
\t
\t
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
\t
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
\t
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
\t
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
\t
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
\t
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
\t
\t
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
\t
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
\t
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
\t
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
\t
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
\t
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
\t
\t
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
\t
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
\t
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
\t
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
\t
9:45 a.m.
\t
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
\t
\t
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
\t
\t
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
\t
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."

Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.

Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.

\t
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
\t
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
\t

She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
\t

Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
\t
\t
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
\t
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
\t
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
\t
\t
\t
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
\t
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.

\t

Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.

Italy\'s Salvini, France\'s Le Pen cement ties before EU vote

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.


Former France midfielder Florent Malouda fired on Twitter
ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.

8:45 a.m.
A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."


UK, US, and France warn Syria not to use chemical weapons
WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.


No surprise in France\'s Fed Cup team against Romania

France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."


Former France player apologizes for racist remark on TV
PARIS (AP) — The beIN Sports television network and commentator Daniel Bravo have apologized after Bravo described Strasbourg striker Nuno Da Costa\'s statistics as "not bad for a black."
Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.
Da Costa wrote: "No worries, a tongue slip happens, he works too much. beIN SPORTS, stop mid-week games please."

French supermajor Total said on Tuesday that it had started up production at the Kaombo Sul oil development, adding 115,000 bpd to bring Total’s overall production capacity to 230,000 bpd, equivalent to 15 percent of Angola’s output.
Kaombo Sul is the sister project of Kaombo Norte and the second Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) unit at the Kaombo project. Total started up production at Kaombo Norte in July last year.
“This second FPSO stands out as an excellent example of standardization to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Its start-up will contribute to the Group’s cash flow and production growth in 2019 and beyond,” said Arnaud Breuillac, President Exploration & Production at Total.
Last year, Total’s production in Angola averaged 211,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd).
Angola, for its part, has been struggling in recent years to offset a decline in production as many fields mature.
After the oil price crash of 2014, Angola’s economy had suffered from the low oil prices and the country had also been struggling to attract international investments in its deepwater higher-breakeven oil resources.
Last year, Angola introduced several new measures to try to boost its oil production and its attractiveness for international investment. President Joao Lourenco signed in the summer of 2018 a decree to create an agency that would sell and manage oil blocks instead of state oil firm Sonangol.
Earlier in 2018, Angola halved the tax rates on the development of oil discoveries with fewer than 300 million barrels of reserves. Angola cut the petroleum production tax on so-called marginal fields—those with below 300 million barrels of reserves—to 10 percent from the typical 20 percent tax. The tax reforms also halved the petroleum income tax on marginal fields to 25 percent from 50 percent.
According to OPEC’s latest available figures, Angola’s crude oil production averaged 1.457 million bpd in February 2019, up by 22,000 bpd compared to January, despite the fact that under the new OPEC+ deal, Angola’s cap is at 1.481 million bpd—higher than its February production.

French oil and gas supermajor Total aims to capture more of the growing Chinese battery and liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets and has just struck two separate deals to gain market shares in the world’s largest electric vehicle (EV) market and the world’s top LNG demand center.
Total’s subsidiary Saft has signed an agreement with China’s privately held Tianneng Group to create a joint venture (JV) to expand their lithium-ion battery production, the supermajor said on Thursday.
Manufacturing will take place at the Changxing Gigafactory, with a potential capacity of 5.5 gigawatt hours (GWh), several GWh of which are already in operation.
The joint venture will focus on the development, manufacturing, and sales of advanced Li-ion cells, modules, and packs for the Chinese and global markets, targeting the e-bikes, EVs, and Energy Storage Solutions (ESS) markets.
“This JV will allow us to make a step change and significantly increase our footprint in the Chinese Li-ion market that will represent over 40% of the global demand by 2025 and to develop our worldwide activities,” Saft CEO
Ghislain Lescuyer said.
In a separate deal announced earlier this week, Total and Guanghui International Natural Gas Trading Co—a subsidiary of Xinjiang-based integrated energy company Guanghui Energy Co—signed a long-term deal under which Total will provide LNG for a period of 10 years to Guanghui’s regasification terminal in Qidong, Jiangsu Province.
The LNG will be sourced from Total’s global LNG portfolio, which the French group aims to significantly grow in the coming years. Total holds a 10-percent share of the global LNG market, it said in the statement.
“This new supply contract is in line with Total’s strategy to expand its presence in the Chinese LNG market, which grew by over 41% in 2018 and will continue to be a key driver of the LNG markets growth in the future,” Laurent Vivier, Senior Vice-President Gas at Total, said.

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
10:15 a.m.
Julian Assange\'s mother has taken to Twitter to call on authorities to be gentle with her son, who\'s jailed in London after his removal from the Ecuadorian Embassy.
Christine Assange\'s tweets on Friday say Assange had been deprived of fresh air, exercise and medical care. "Please be patient, gentle & kind to him" she asked of police and court personnel.
The WikiLeaks founder is an Australia native, and the government said he would receive consular help due to its citizens after he was arrested on a U.S. conspiracy charge. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the expected battle over Assange\'s possible extradition would not involve Australia.
___
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."


Former France player apologizes for racist remark on TV
PARIS (AP) — The beIN Sports television network and commentator Daniel Bravo have apologized after Bravo described Strasbourg striker Nuno Da Costa\'s statistics as "not bad for a black."
Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.
Da Costa wrote: "No worries, a tongue slip happens, he works too much. beIN SPORTS, stop mid-week games please."

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.


Former France midfielder Florent Malouda fired on Twitter
ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye" caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France, switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah.
He says living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, and has no plans to move even as the show takes off.


France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."

Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.

UK, US, and France warn Syria not to use chemical weapons
WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."
___
9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.

A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.


France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.


Former France player apologizes for racist remark on TV
PARIS (AP) — The beIN Sports television network and commentator Daniel Bravo have apologized after Bravo described Strasbourg striker Nuno Da Costa\'s statistics as "not bad for a black."
Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.
Da Costa wrote: "No worries, a tongue slip happens, he works too much. beIN SPORTS, stop mid-week games please."

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."
___
9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."


France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.


Former France midfielder Florent Malouda fired on Twitter
ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.


UK, US, and France warn Syria not to use chemical weapons
WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."


GRUNGE legend Kurt Cobain has allegedly been spotted hiding out in France \xe2\x80\x93 nearly 25 years after his death.
A number of bizarre conspiracy theories have emerged after the Nirvana frontman killed himself in Seattle, Washington, in April 1994. Many truthers are convinced the rocker was killed – but others allege he is still alive and leading a new life far from the US. Programmer Daniel Carr took a bizarre picture last month and uploaded to Twitter with the caption: “Kurt Cobain is alive and living in Nice, France.” In it, a bloke with long blonde hair and similar facial features to Cobain is pictured leaning back on a chair in the sunshine.
He can also be seen wearing a leopard print coat that the singer posed with, and some of his trademark sunglasses. Back in 2017, another video surfaced that convinced some Nirvana fans Cobain was still with us. Singer Ramiro Saavedra performed hit single Come As You Are on a Peruvian talent show, with his performance going viral. With guitar in hand, Ramiro mimicked Cobain’s iconic hairstyle, wore a similar cardigan, and impressed with his note-for-note performance.

One Reddit user wrote: “OMG Kurt Cobain from Nirvana is alive!” and another simply added: “He is alive!” Others are convinced that Cobain was actually murdered, including a private investigators who was involved in the search for his body. Tom Grant was interviewed in 2015 documentary Soaked in Bleach, where he questioned the official police report that Cobain locked himself in his greenhouse before his suicide. Tom had visited the singer\'s house after his death and took a photo that he claimed disproved that theory.


The French President is said to be frustrated with having to be “summoned” to Brussels for yet another emergency Brexit summit, according to a source familiar with the process. France and Belgium are hardening in their position against Britain ahead of next week’s gathering of EU leaders in Brussels. EU diplomats and officials expect Theresa May to travel to the Belgian capital to ask for a year-long Brexit delay or tell her European counterparts that Britain will leave the bloc without a deal on April 12, according to a source.
But an “impatient” Mr Macron could scupper any chance of a lengthy extension to the EU’s Article 50 exit clause when he arrives at the summit. An EU diplomat said: “If it were left up to the French and the Belgians, it’d be all over! “There seems to be a somewhat of a historical issue with the French President being summoned to Brussels because of Britain. “But not everyone is there yet, so we can’t rule anything out at this stage of the game.”
Emmanuel Macron could reject Theresa May request for long Brexit delay
Throughout the Brexit negotiations, France has been considered Britain’s toughest critic and were most likely to reject compromise positions. And ahead of a Benelux summit between Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, Belgian prime minister Charles Michel warned that the chances of a no-deal Brexit are increasing. He said: “The scenario of a no deal is strengthened in the absence of a clear vision of the British Parliament.” The tough leaders lack faith in Mrs May’s ability to deliver her Brexit deal and are unsure on that changing during a long extension, during which Britain will be able to meddle in EU affairs.
EU27 ambassadors are due to hold a number of secret meetings in order to finalise the last-minute plans to prepare the bloc for a no-deal Brexit. Heads of state will also see their most senior Europe advisor meet to put together a proposal that could see Britain remain an EU member until April 2020. But these talks will unlikely be finalised until after Mr Macron meets with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar. This morning, EU negotiator Michel Barnier insisted Britain would have to handover £39billion and implement the hated Irish backstop before being invited back to the negotiating table in the event of a hard Brexit. Speaking in Brussels, Mr Barnier said: "If there is no deal it will be the responsibility of the UK to choose to leave without a deal. What will happen after, in any case we will have to build new relations with the UK and a few months after I\'m sure the UK will ask the EU to begin negotiations for some sectors – aviation, transport and obviously trade.


Emmanuel Macron is expected to be the biggest obstacle to a smooth transition into a longer Brexit extension after the French President signalled he is not ready to agree to a delay without imposing new conditions on the UK. Theresa May travelled to Brussels on Wednesday to attend an emergency meeting with the EU27 to secure their support to postpone Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union until June 30. But addressing the press before the meeting, Mr Macron warned he will not allow Brexit to “get in the way” of the European project.

The French leader said: “I come to this emergency summit with some simple principles.
“The first principle is that we have a European project. It’s been 34 months since the UK referendum was held ad the key for us is that the European project is maintained in its coherence.
"We have, in these 34 months, managed to progress the matter at hand. We have, in these 34 months, managed to make decisions and above all managed to stay united, together.
“I think this union is important but the unity of the European project is still at risk.”

Norbert Rottgen, chairman of the German foreign affairs committee and an ally of Angela Merkel, insisted granting Britain a longer Article 50 extension “would have been better” for the EU. He claimed the French President was demanding a brief delay to benefit his own European Parliament election campaign. On Twitter, Mr Rottgen wrote: “A longer Brexit extension would have been much better!
“But Macron prioritised his own election campaign and interests over European Union. “The UK now needs to use the new deadline to either decision on the case or a political path forward. “Good news: time should be sufficient for that.” The German’s rant comes after EU leaders agreed to delay Brexit until October 31 with a “review” of the process to take place at June’s European Council summit.
Angela Merkel ally hits out at Emmanuel Macron over Brexit delay row
Mr Macron was left entirely isolated in his push for a short Brexit delay, according to a senior EU official. The source said: “Of the EU27, 19 member states supported a longer extension, 7 were in between and the rest went short.” Donald Tusk, the European Council President, warned Mrs May not to “waste this time” given to her. He refused to rule out another extension though, adding: “I am too old to exclude another scenario.


Valentino Dixon got a golf lesson from the great Tom Watson on his first, emotional visit to the Masters this week.
Dixon, 49, spent 27 years in prison for a crime he did not commit before he was released last year. While inside, he drew a picture of the iconic short 12th hole here and it was published in Golf Digest – and the magazine then fought successfully for his release.
“I come from a different world. For this world to embrace me means everything. I was trying to hold back the tears today,” said Dixon, who is working for Golf Digest here this week.
“I’m able to see things that I didn’t see before. Previously, I’m drawing from magazine pictures and stuff like that.
“A lot of it I recognised. This one tree that bends over, I’ve drawn it so many times but just being able to see the detail in person, and the bridge and the colouring of the stone - a photograph can’t capture that.”


The European Union are expected to face an uphill battle with growing populist parties across the bloc ahead of the European elections scheduled for May 23-26. French philosopher Bernard-Henry Levi suggested outspoken eurosceptic like Italy\'s Matteo Salvini or French far-right politician Marine Le Pen could receive the backing of "external forces" to further undermine the European project in the run-up to the European vote across the member states. Speaking to Euronews, Mr Levi said: "You have now some political forces who use democracy to ruin democracy, who use elections in order to torpedo the system which makes election possible and who are going to use the European Parliament to corrupt from the inside, to weaken and maybe destroy the European project itself
"You have populist movements all over Europe supported from outside by external force like Mr Putin." Brussels has repeatedly locked horns with Vladimir Putin following the annexation of Crimea to the Russian Federation in 2014 – which sparked retaliation from the bloc through high-pressure sanctions on Moscow imports and exports. Mr Levi also suggested US President Donald Trump, to whom Italian deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini offered a close alliance, could play an important role in firing up support for eurosceptic parties during the European elections. He continued: "The two enemies of European values are linked. READ MORE: Germany whips up anti-Brexit sentiment to destroy eurosceptic views ahead of EU election
EU news: Brussels has been warned of potential Russian interference in the elections
"On one side you have people like Marine Le Pen or Salvini or others, on the other side, you have people like Vladimir Putin or, alas, Donald Trump who are fuelling the internal force." The European People’s Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), historically the strongest in the European Parliament, could see their support eroded by populist and eurosceptic parties. Anti-EU parties are predicted to swoop many of the 705 seats up for grabs. The EPP would lose 34 seats, going from the 217 gained in 2014 to 183, and the S&D as many as 51, from 186 to 135, according to projections made public in February. Groups including Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party and Italy’s leading parties Five Star Movement (M5S) and Mr Salvini’s Lega may see a massive surge in popular support. Anti-immigration Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF), born from the alliance of Mrs Le Pen and Geert Wilders, leader of Dutch Party for Freedom, could gather 22 seats and jump from 37 to 59 MEPs.


The so-called “yellow vest” demonstrations against the French President started in mid-November over planned fuel tax hikes but quickly spiralled into a revolt against the Government’s alleged elitism. Hosting BBC This Week, Andrew Neil said the political drama in Britain could actually be a sign of a “vibrant democracy” as he highlighted on the current uproar across the continent. Mr Neil said: “We haven’t had the gilets jaunes. There is a kind of nasty undercurrent that I see from both sides at times.
We are not setting fire to Oxford Street every Saturday afternoon Andrew Neil
“We certainly are not setting fire to Oxford Street every Saturday afternoon the way the French are setting fire to the Champs-Élysées. “We don’t have 93 hard right MPs in our Parliament the way the Germans have in the Bundestag. “In a way, you could look at this and say Parliament is right at the forefront – people are watching it, ratings for political programmes are very high these days and newspapers. “You could say this is actually a sign of a vibrant democracy.”
Brexit news: Andrew Neil said Britain has a "vibrant democracy"
Mr Macron hit out at Britain this week and said the EU “cannot be the hostage for the solution to a political crisis in the UK”. The French President also indicated he is losing patience with the lack of progress being made by British politicians. Speaking alongside Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar outside the Elysee Palace in Paris ahead of their meeting on Tuesday, he said: “Let me repeat this – our priority is the good functioning of the EU and the single market. “The EU cannot sustainably be the hostage for the solution to a political crisis in the UK.


Brexit news: John Humphrys clashed with Bruno Bonnell over a Brexit delay
Theresa May wrote to EU Council President on Friday asking for a Brexit delay until June 30 but wants to terminate any extension before the European polls if she is able to get a deal through Parliament. The Prime Minister is currently engaged in EU talks with the Labour Party after she reached out to Jeremy Corbyn to try to deliver Brexit, sparking fury among MPs in the Conservative Party’s eurosceptic European Research Group. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, an MP for En Marche! Bruno Bonnell, claimed France would not accept another short extension but would be open to the idea of a longer delay.
He said: “It’s clearly a no, a no for many reasons. First one being we have been giving some delays so far, with no result. “There is such a misunderstanding here in France, about the attitude of the UK Parliament, we just don’t understand what they are doing, so why would we give more time for a dead end at this point? “We have to accept that a no deal might be the option.” BBC host John Humphrys stepped in asking what if the Prime Minister asked for a longer delay. He said: “What if she were to say instead, let’s have one year, two years, five years, what would you say then.”
It’s either a long delay like beyond five years, or it is a very short delay to clarify the situation Bruno Bonnell
Mr Bonnell replied: “That would be different. My point was, why don’t we give another week, like last call before next Wednesday’s meeting, so we can have a perspective signature of this treaty. “Or we effectively give five years. We welcome in UK representatives at the European Parliament to prove that we can change the EU Parliament and therefore there will be a reevaluation later on. “It’s either a long delay like beyond five years, or it is a very short delay to clarify the situation.” The BBC presenter responded saying: “Of course, a really long delay would be utterly unacceptable to a huge number of people in this country.” The French MP said he “didn’t know” what the reaction would be in the UK. He said: “I have seen very conflicting opinions.
“We have seen 6 million people plus signing a letter requesting another referendum. We have seen people who feel they have been cheated. And we have seen people that want a Brexit no matter what. “From the European perspective, it is very confusing and probably very embarrassing at this stage that we can’t get out of this situation.” On Friday, Mrs May wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to Article 50 until June 30. The Prime Minister said she will seek to ratify her withdrawal agreement before the European Parliament elections on May 23, but will make "responsible preparations" to take part if that does not prove possible.


Emmanuel Macron is expected to be the biggest obstacle to a smooth transition into a longer Brexit extension after the French President signalled he is not ready to agree to a delay without imposing new conditions on the UK. Theresa May travelled to Brussels on Wednesday to attend an emergency meeting with the EU27 to secure their support to postpone Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union until June 30.

Brexit news: Emmanuel Macron WARNED May as he arrived at the Brussels summit
Mr Macron continued: “Therefore it is paramount that nothing gets in the way of the European project in the next few months. “We have a European renaissance to carry out and I don’t want Brexit to prevent us going onwards.” Ahead of his meeting with the Prime Minister on Tuesday, Mr Macron suggested Britain be subjected to compliance checks every three months during a potential extension to monitor trade with the bloc. When asked if she was "embarrassed" she could not keep the promise made 108 times to Britons to leave the EU by March 29, Mrs May put the blame on her MPs and said: "I know many people will be frustrated that the summit is taking place at all because the UK should have left the European Union by now. “I greatly regret the fact that Parliament has not been able to pass a deal that that would enable us to leave in a smooth and orderly way, but I and the Government continue to work to find a way forward."


EU expert reveals countries with most to lose in no-deal Brexit
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said the bloc is prepared but experts have cast doubt on the eurocrat’s claims. Pieter Cleppe, of the Open Europe think tank, has warned the countries with the closest ties to Britain will be worst hit. Ireland, the Netherlands, France, Germany and Belgium have most at stake on the Continent and have attempt to protect themselves from the cliff edge if there is a hard Brexit on April 12.
Mr Cleppe said: “The UK\'s neighbouring countries haven\'t hired the sufficient number of customs staff or veterinary inspectors needed in case of a no deal. “Measures have been decided to mitigate the worst of the damage but these measures are all temporary and unilateral, whereas actual agreements with the UK are needed, for example to prevent disruption in aviation or to protect supply chains of big manufacturers.

The French President, a staunch pro-European, drove a wedge into the EU’s unshakable unity over Brexit while leaders for six hours painstaking debated handing Theresa May a second Article 50 extension in less than a month. Frustration poured out of the eleventh-floor dining room where Mrs May presented her plans to the EU27 before they tucked into scallops, cod loin, macadamia nut parfait and a lengthy discussion on the Prime Minister’s request to delay Brexit until June 30. Prior to the meeting, Mr Macron declared: “We have a European renaissance to manage.
“I believe in it very deeply and I don’t want Brexit to come and block us on this.” But his hardline stance won him very few supporters amongst his colleagues, who spent the evening trying to remove the French President from his high horse. He frantically tried to explain to EU colleagues that Mrs May had done little to convince him that she had a genuine plan and a credible way out of a long extension. But a mounting list of opposition from Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Hungary and Portugal all spoke in favour of allowing Britain to remain an EU member until March 2020.
Emmanuel Macron infuriated EU colleagues in a bid to scupper a long Brexit delay
The French President reminded the others that “you need unanimity” for the European Council to agree the Brexit delay, remaining insistent that any extension should be as short as possible. Mr Juncker, the European Commission president, who favoured a long delay, was said to be “very annoyed” with Mr Macron, according to an EU source. The Commission chief rebuked Mr Macron in one fiery exchange, during which the French leader claimed he would struggle to explain a long Brexit delay back home. “We are now solving France’s domestic problems,” snapped Mr Juncker, according to one diplomat familiar with the discussions.
Even German Chancellor Angela Merkel, an often calming influence, was becoming exasperated with the actions of Mr Macron. Her officials believed that his stance had pushed EU unity to within inches of its breaking point. The German leader was described as an important influence in helping the bloc force Mr Macron to eventually soften his approach as talks moved past midnight. And, as so often happens at late-night EU summits, leaders produced a fudged compromise to keep all parties happy. Britain will now remain an EU member until October 31, unless Mrs May refuses to organise European Parliament elections or ratifies her draft withdrawal agreement.


The relationship between Italy and France has grown frosty since the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star movement won power last year and took aim at the French leader. The widespread anti-French sentiment in Italy is fuelled by Mr Salvini and his far-right League party, Mr Saviano told France’s Europe 1 radio. He said: “At the moment, anti-French sentiment is very strong in Italy, because we always need to point the finger at someone. “And [French President] Emmanuel Macron is being held responsible for all of the things that Mr Salvini is incapable of dealing with.”
Mr Saviano, a fierce and vocal critic of Mr Salvini, who is also interior minister, added that the French were being wrongly blamed for Italy’s social and economic woes.
He said: “[The French] are accused of dumping migrants on the border with Italy, of harbouring Italian terrorists, of colonising Africa and of fuelling Europe’s immigration crisis.”
Migrants, Mr Saviano continued, have been unfairly turned into “scapegoats” and are being blamed for Italy’s job crisis and sluggish economy.
He warned, in a reference to the Hungarian prime minister’s hardline rule and tough anti-migrant stance: “There is no such thing as a migrant invasion – despite what [the government] says on a daily basis. I think that Mr Salvini is undermining Italian democracy, by turning it into something that resembles Viktor Orban’s Hungary.
“The nationalist right is on the rise in Italy, and the situation is very complicated. My message to the French is this: ‘Look at Italy, because this is your future’. They too will one day elect a minister [like Mr Salvini].”
The relationship between Italy and France has had its ups and downs in recent months.

Prime Minister Theresa May have requested a short extension to the end of June but the EU has instead proposed a 12-month delay to Brexit. In respect to claims Britain could be forced into a year-long extension, Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg called for Britain to deliberately be disruptive if Britain is forced to have a long extension to the Article 50 process. Former French ambassador Pierre Sellal claimed the EU should “not be held hostage of British politics” as he hit out at claims made by Mr Rees-Mogg.
It is not a French fantasy Pierre Sellal
Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he warned: “There would be a risk that the proper functioning of the institutions, of the legitimacy of one of the most important institutions which is the European Parliament, would be at risk. “What we would ask from the UK Government, if we have to consider a possible new delay, is a commitment to behave in a cooperative way and it is not a French fantasy. “We noted some statements made by prominent British politicians saying that, should the UK still be a member state in the months ahead, they consider that the UK has to behave as a very difficult partner.” Mr Sellal said Mr Rees-Mogg’s comments will not encourage the EU 27 to grant another Brexit delay.

The EU expert said it would be useful to have the demands in writing, before adding that another form of backstop proposal “could be useful”. Mr Sellal joked: “I know this word is a problem in itself and today but I think it will be necessary to have sufficient guarantees.” Mr Rees-Mogg said on Friday morning that “if a long extension leaves us stuck in the EU we should be as difficult as possible”. He added: “We could veto any increase in the budget, obstruct the putative EU army and block Mr Macron’s integrationist schemes.” A European Commission spokesperson hit back at the comments and told reporters in Brussels: “This gentleman is not our interlocutor and I would say then that the principle of sincere cooperation does apply, as Prime Minister May herself makes clear in her letter. “I would also say that this is a hypothetical question because it supposes, or presupposed an extension, which is yet to be seen by our leaders.”


Norbert Rottgen, chairman of the German foreign affairs committee and an ally of Angela Merkel, insisted granting Britain a longer Article 50 extension “would have been better” for the EU. He claimed the French President was demanding a brief delay to benefit his own European Parliament election campaign. On Twitter, Mr Rottgen wrote: “A longer Brexit extension would have been much better!
“But Macron prioritised his own election campaign and interests over European Union. “The UK now needs to use the new deadline to either decision on the case or a political path forward. “Good news: time should be sufficient for that.” The German’s rant comes after EU leaders agreed to delay Brexit until October 31 with a “review” of the process to take place at June’s European Council summit.
Angela Merkel ally hits out at Emmanuel Macron over Brexit delay row
Mr Macron was left entirely isolated in his push for a short Brexit delay, according to a senior EU official. The source said: “Of the EU27, 19 member states supported a longer extension, 7 were in between and the rest went short.” Donald Tusk, the European Council President, warned Mrs May not to “waste this time” given to her. He refused to rule out another extension though, adding: “I am too old to exclude another scenario.


EU expert reveals countries with most to lose in no-deal Brexit
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said the bloc is prepared but experts have cast doubt on the eurocrat’s claims. Pieter Cleppe, of the Open Europe think tank, has warned the countries with the closest ties to Britain will be worst hit. Ireland, the Netherlands, France, Germany and Belgium have most at stake on the Continent and have attempt to protect themselves from the cliff edge if there is a hard Brexit on April 12.
Mr Cleppe said: “The UK\'s neighbouring countries haven\'t hired the sufficient number of customs staff or veterinary inspectors needed in case of a no deal. “Measures have been decided to mitigate the worst of the damage but these measures are all temporary and unilateral, whereas actual agreements with the UK are needed, for example to prevent disruption in aviation or to protect supply chains of big manufacturers. Also the EU budget will feel the strain in case the UK leaves without a deal, which will also affect national budgets of member states that are net beneficiaries of EU funds.”
The Netherlands Dutch trade unions have warned that the army, police and customs officials are not ready for a no-deal Brexit. They suggest there could be serious consequences for security because of an instant loss of information sharing with Britain. Marc de Natris, chairman of the Joint Officers Associations, said despite a significant effort to hire extra staff, not enough will be sufficiently trained in event of a no-deal Brexit. He said: “Due to the tight labour market, new staff are not available or have not been trained yet. “Brexit will increase the workload. The focus will be on Schiphol, but we will soon notice how long that can be sustained and what consequences this will have for other tasks.” Gerrit Van De Kamp, who is working on the ACP police association’s hard Brexit team, said extra staff would have to be dedicated to information sharing with Britain. He said: “The information exchange will go through Interpol, which is an extra element. For matters where rapid information exchange is important exchange is important, such as human trafficking, goods and migration flows, this is an obstacle.”

So much so, economy minister Peter Altmaier said the best Brexit option for Germany would see Britain remain in the customs union.

He said companies are "shaking their heads" at the decision and that "Britain and Europe are stumbling toward an unregulated withdrawal from the EU”. "There\'s a threat in just a few days of a substantial Brexit bureaucracy and the demolition of supply chains involving the United Kingdom," he added.

The so-called “yellow vest” demonstrations against the French President started in mid-November over planned fuel tax hikes but quickly spiralled into a revolt against the Government’s alleged elitism. Hosting BBC This Week, Andrew Neil said the political drama in Britain could actually be a sign of a “vibrant democracy” as he highlighted on the current uproar across the continent. Mr Neil said: “We haven’t had the gilets jaunes. There is a kind of nasty undercurrent that I see from both sides at times.
We are not setting fire to Oxford Street every Saturday afternoon Andrew Neil
“We certainly are not setting fire to Oxford Street every Saturday afternoon the way the French are setting fire to the Champs-Élysées. “We don’t have 93 hard right MPs in our Parliament the way the Germans have in the Bundestag. “In a way, you could look at this and say Parliament is right at the forefront – people are watching it, ratings for political programmes are very high these days and newspapers. “You could say this is actually a sign of a vibrant democracy.”
Brexit news: Andrew Neil said Britain has a "vibrant democracy"
Mr Macron hit out at Britain this week and said the EU “cannot be the hostage for the solution to a political crisis in the UK”. The French President also indicated he is losing patience with the lack of progress being made by British politicians. Speaking alongside Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar outside the Elysee Palace in Paris ahead of their meeting on Tuesday, he said: “Let me repeat this – our priority is the good functioning of the EU and the single market. “The EU cannot sustainably be the hostage for the solution to a political crisis in the UK.


Trader Darren Cox, who operates a market stall on Chelmsford High Street, said there are problems in getting fruit and vegetables coming in off the continent. Speaking to BBC News, Mr Cox said: “There’s a lot of stuff behind the scenes that people don’t realise. There are massive delays currently over in France that are not so bad this week but last week lorries were in like 10 to 15-hour delays sometimes. And people don’t realise what is going on behind the scenes. They really don’t.”
I think they are being told to slow it down and show them this is what it will be like Darren Cox
There have been delays to imports of fruit and vegetables as a result of a work-to-rule strike by French customs officers warning they are not ready for Brexit. French customs officers have been carrying out longer and more rigorous checks than usual to represent what might happen in the event of a no deal Brexit. The work-to-rule strike action began at Calais and Dunkirk ports on March 4 and continued throughout the month. Mr Cox later told Express.co.uk he believes the customs officers are being advised to strike and cause delays.

He added: "I think a bit of this is propaganda and nobody knows about it. "I don’t think it is strike action - I think they are being told to slow it down and show them this is what it will be like and this is what is going to go on in a no deal Brexit." The trader warned about how much a 10-hour delay can impact Britain’s fresh food industry. He said: “If you have got a 10-hour delay, that lorry that would be there at midnight for us to buy fresh stuff to bring to markets today, it could not hit there until six or seven the next day which means it is 24 hours late. “24 hours late on freshness, which by the time it gets back into the circle, you are going to be 24 hours behind where you need to be.” Mr Cox, who voted for Brexit and said he would do so again, said EU leaders are “petrified” of Britain leaving. He said: “I was a Leaver. I probably still am a Leaver, to be fair. If I voted again I probably would vote to Leave. However, I do have more concerns now than what I initially had when I was voting to Leave.


Valentino Dixon got a golf lesson from the great Tom Watson on his first, emotional visit to the Masters this week.
Dixon, 49, spent 27 years in prison for a crime he did not commit before he was released last year. While inside, he drew a picture of the iconic short 12th hole here and it was published in Golf Digest – and the magazine then fought successfully for his release.
“I come from a different world. For this world to embrace me means everything. I was trying to hold back the tears today,” said Dixon, who is working for Golf Digest here this week.
“I’m able to see things that I didn’t see before. Previously, I’m drawing from magazine pictures and stuff like that.
“A lot of it I recognised. This one tree that bends over, I’ve drawn it so many times but just being able to see the detail in person, and the bridge and the colouring of the stone - a photograph can’t capture that.”

As Brexit talks reach deadlock and Prime Minister Theresa May battles to find a solution before Friday’s scheduled exit day, the ITV host launched into a furious rant and said the French are “laughing” at Britain. Following an interview with former Tory leader Lord Howard about the Brexit impasse, the ITV host said: “I’ve just come back from France over the last few weeks, and I am not making this up when I say I was getting free coffees and croissants in the cafes that I go to a lot there because they feel sorry for me because I am British.
They are actually laughing at us. They think we are pathetic Richard Madeley
“They are actually laughing at us. They think we are pathetic. “And they don’t like us very much but they still think we are pathetic.” Prime Minister Theresa May is travelling to Paris on Tuesday to make a plea for France’s Emmanuel Macron not to veto her request for a further delay to Brexit. President Macron could demand there be no extension of the Article 50 process unless the Prime Minister signs up to binding commitments to stand aside from the EU decision-making process.
Brexit news: Richard Madeley said French think British are "pathetic"
EU leaders this week must decide whether to grant Britain another Brexit delay, a decision that must get unanimous backing by all 27 member states. The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has warned the UK will “not discuss anything” if there is to be a no deal Brexit. Mr Barnier met with Irish premier Leo Varadakar in the Irish capital to “take stock” of developments in London. Mr Barnier claimed the EU “stood fully behind Ireland” and would “refuse” to talk to the UK under a no deal exit “until there is an agreement for Ireland and Northern Ireland”.

Last night EU ambassadors gave the green light to the European Commission to commence talks with Washington. The negotiations will proceed despite protests from Mr Macron over Donald Trump’s decision to quit the Paris Agreement on climate change. Officials in Paris have warned they can’t be supportive of the US trade talks after the country pulled out of the 2015 international climate pact.
“I am not in favour of having new trade deals, in whatever form, with whoever is, with partners that do not have the same climate standards that we have because that would be unfair competition for our companies, our farmers,” said Mr Macron on Thursday. “If we should move forward, I have always been clear, we cannot do it unless we have guarantees.” In what will be the French President’s second Brussels defeat this week, his aides have conceded they have backed handing the Commission the mandate to kickstart the talks. But one Elysee official insisted, in a sign of rebellion, Paris will vote against them at an EU ministerial meeting on Monday.
Emmanuel Macron\'s France plot to block and hold up EU-US trade deal
But the French vote will be meaningless because only a qualified majority is needed to sanction the talks. The source added: “It is a question of values. Europe must be exemplary and firm in its defence of the climate.” Mr Macron is particularly concerned with a US trade deal opening up certain sectors to competition, including farming and fisheries, close to the ‘Yellow Vest’ protest movement they have marred his premiership. Germany has strived to force a compromise that address Paris’ concerns across the table.
Paris has instead signalled it will “continue the fight” after May’s European Parliament elections. “It’s a major issue for the coming months and for the European elections,” the French official said. France will use its MEPs to block and hold any deal done with the US unless its demands over climate and industry are met. The EU-US trade talks will focus on eliminating industrial tariffs after a primary agreement between Mr Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, in Washington last year.


French President Emmanuel Macron is “worried” about Britain remaining in the EU, or Brexit having a lengthy delay, Janet Daley, from the Sunday Telegraph has claimed. Speaking on BBC’s Dateline London, Daley claimed Emmanuel Macron\'s “utopian dream” about Europe was “diametrically opposed” to the Tories and to “Britain’s history and its institutions”. Ms Daley commented on the prospect of a lengthy delay to Britain’s departure from the EU.
She said: “It’s a question of what Europe would think. “It is already beginning to become apparent that Macron is seriously worried about either a long extension or us staying in permanently. “His utopian dream about Europe is diametrically opposed not only to the Tories but to the most fundamental democratic sense of Britain’s history and its institutions. That is a reconcilable difference.” She added: “They have created a logically impossible situation where it seems to be an unresolvable dilemma of coming out.
Macron is \'worried\' about a Brexit delay or the UK remaining a political commentator claimed

“But, also staying in is irreconcilable from the EU’s point of view.” Ms Daley claimed if the UK remained in the European Union past the European elections, “we could legitimise an awful lot of the anti-EU eurosceptic sentiment that is so prevalent in Europe because we have this long tradition of stable democracy.” She said: “That might not be very helpful to people like Macron who want to continue his centralising project and want to continue the federalisation of the EU.” On Friday, Mrs May wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to the Article 50 process until June 30.
The Prime Minister said she will seek to ratify her withdrawal agreement before the European Parliament elections on May 23, but will make "responsible preparations" to take part if that does not prove possible. Mrs May said if ongoing talks with Labour do not lead to a "single unified approach soon" then the Government would instead look to establish a "consensus" on options on a future relationship that could be put to the Commons. Reports suggest Mr Tusk is recommending a longer postponement of one year, with a break clause in the case of earlier ratification, in a so-called "flextension" deal.


The French President, a staunch pro-European, drove a wedge into the EU’s unshakable unity over Brexit while leaders for six hours painstaking debated handing Theresa May a second Article 50 extension in less than a month. Frustration poured out of the eleventh-floor dining room where Mrs May presented her plans to the EU27 before they tucked into scallops, cod loin, macadamia nut parfait and a lengthy discussion on the Prime Minister’s request to delay Brexit until June 30. Prior to the meeting, Mr Macron declared: “We have a European renaissance to manage.
“I believe in it very deeply and I don’t want Brexit to come and block us on this.” But his hardline stance won him very few supporters amongst his colleagues, who spent the evening trying to remove the French President from his high horse. He frantically tried to explain to EU colleagues that Mrs May had done little to convince him that she had a genuine plan and a credible way out of a long extension. But a mounting list of opposition from Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Hungary and Portugal all spoke in favour of allowing Britain to remain an EU member until March 2020.
Emmanuel Macron infuriated EU colleagues in a bid to scupper a long Brexit delay
The French President reminded the others that “you need unanimity” for the European Council to agree the Brexit delay, remaining insistent that any extension should be as short as possible. Mr Juncker, the European Commission president, who favoured a long delay, was said to be “very annoyed” with Mr Macron, according to an EU source. The Commission chief rebuked Mr Macron in one fiery exchange, during which the French leader claimed he would struggle to explain a long Brexit delay back home. “We are now solving France’s domestic problems,” snapped Mr Juncker, according to one diplomat familiar with the discussions.
Even German Chancellor Angela Merkel, an often calming influence, was becoming exasperated with the actions of Mr Macron. Her officials believed that his stance had pushed EU unity to within inches of its breaking point. The German leader was described as an important influence in helping the bloc force Mr Macron to eventually soften his approach as talks moved past midnight. And, as so often happens at late-night EU summits, leaders produced a fudged compromise to keep all parties happy. Britain will now remain an EU member until October 31, unless Mrs May refuses to organise European Parliament elections or ratifies her draft withdrawal agreement.


The relationship between Italy and France has grown frosty since the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star movement won power last year and took aim at the French leader. The widespread anti-French sentiment in Italy is fuelled by Mr Salvini and his far-right League party, Mr Saviano told France’s Europe 1 radio. He said: “At the moment, anti-French sentiment is very strong in Italy, because we always need to point the finger at someone. “And [French President] Emmanuel Macron is being held responsible for all of the things that Mr Salvini is incapable of dealing with.”
Mr Saviano, a fierce and vocal critic of Mr Salvini, who is also interior minister, added that the French were being wrongly blamed for Italy’s social and economic woes.
He said: “[The French] are accused of dumping migrants on the border with Italy, of harbouring Italian terrorists, of colonising Africa and of fuelling Europe’s immigration crisis.”
Migrants, Mr Saviano continued, have been unfairly turned into “scapegoats” and are being blamed for Italy’s job crisis and sluggish economy.
He warned, in a reference to the Hungarian prime minister’s hardline rule and tough anti-migrant stance: “There is no such thing as a migrant invasion – despite what [the government] says on a daily basis. I think that Mr Salvini is undermining Italian democracy, by turning it into something that resembles Viktor Orban’s Hungary.
“The nationalist right is on the rise in Italy, and the situation is very complicated. My message to the French is this: ‘Look at Italy, because this is your future’. They too will one day elect a minister [like Mr Salvini].”
The relationship between Italy and France has had its ups and downs in recent months.


The French President is said to be frustrated with having to be “summoned” to Brussels for yet another emergency Brexit summit, according to a source familiar with the process. France and Belgium are hardening in their position against Britain ahead of next week’s gathering of EU leaders in Brussels. EU diplomats and officials expect Theresa May to travel to the Belgian capital to ask for a year-long Brexit delay or tell her European counterparts that Britain will leave the bloc without a deal on April 12, according to a source.
But an “impatient” Mr Macron could scupper any chance of a lengthy extension to the EU’s Article 50 exit clause when he arrives at the summit. An EU diplomat said: “If it were left up to the French and the Belgians, it’d be all over! “There seems to be a somewhat of a historical issue with the French President being summoned to Brussels because of Britain. “But not everyone is there yet, so we can’t rule anything out at this stage of the game.”
Emmanuel Macron could reject Theresa May request for long Brexit delay
Throughout the Brexit negotiations, France has been considered Britain’s toughest critic and were most likely to reject compromise positions. And ahead of a Benelux summit between Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, Belgian prime minister Charles Michel warned that the chances of a no-deal Brexit are increasing. He said: “The scenario of a no deal is strengthened in the absence of a clear vision of the British Parliament.” The tough leaders lack faith in Mrs May’s ability to deliver her Brexit deal and are unsure on that changing during a long extension, during which Britain will be able to meddle in EU affairs.
EU27 ambassadors are due to hold a number of secret meetings in order to finalise the last-minute plans to prepare the bloc for a no-deal Brexit. Heads of state will also see their most senior Europe advisor meet to put together a proposal that could see Britain remain an EU member until April 2020. But these talks will unlikely be finalised until after Mr Macron meets with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar. This morning, EU negotiator Michel Barnier insisted Britain would have to handover £39billion and implement the hated Irish backstop before being invited back to the negotiating table in the event of a hard Brexit. Speaking in Brussels, Mr Barnier said: "If there is no deal it will be the responsibility of the UK to choose to leave without a deal. What will happen after, in any case we will have to build new relations with the UK and a few months after I\'m sure the UK will ask the EU to begin negotiations for some sectors – aviation, transport and obviously trade.


Having finished sixth or higher in the six tournaments he has played so far in 2019, Rory McIlroy heads into The Masters as strong favourite. It is the one major to have alluded him over the years, although he has consistently played well around there. If McIlroy is able to add The Masters title to his growing collection, he will become only the sixth golfer in history to hold all four majors at any time. But there are a number of golf\'s finest players also heading into Augusta on top of their game.
And North, who now works as an ESPN analyst, believes that bodes well for a close-fought tournament this week. “I think we’re really lucky that for the first major of the year, a lot of the main guys are playing really well,” he told Express Sport. “Obviously Rory is playing great; Dustin Johnson is playing well; Justin Rose is playing very, very well; Tiger looks like he’s ready to play really well; Molinari has been fantastic." Molinari has shown recently that he is starting to rediscover his form that saw him win The Open last year. He has never finished higher than 19th in his seven entries at The Masters, but recently won the Arnold Palmer Invitational with a sensational 64 in the final round.

Francesco Molinari has looked strong in recent weeks
And North wouldn\'t be surprised to see the Italian Ryder Cup hero go on and win The Masters this week. “He’s played so well and he played great at the Match Play, until he faced Tiger," he added. “We’ve seen him not play his best with Tiger before, all these kids wanted him to be there and now he’s got the chance to do it, sometimes it doesn’t work out quite as well as they thought. “But I think if you look at Rory’s game and what you need to do well to win at Augusta, it fits so perfectly.

Norbert Rottgen, chairman of the German foreign affairs committee and an ally of Angela Merkel, insisted granting Britain a longer Article 50 extension “would have been better” for the EU. He claimed the French President was demanding a brief delay to benefit his own European Parliament election campaign. On Twitter, Mr Rottgen wrote: “A longer Brexit extension would have been much better!
“But Macron prioritised his own election campaign and interests over European Union. “The UK now needs to use the new deadline to either decision on the case or a political path forward. “Good news: time should be sufficient for that.” The German’s rant comes after EU leaders agreed to delay Brexit until October 31 with a “review” of the process to take place at June’s European Council summit.
Angela Merkel ally hits out at Emmanuel Macron over Brexit delay row
Mr Macron was left entirely isolated in his push for a short Brexit delay, according to a senior EU official. The source said: “Of the EU27, 19 member states supported a longer extension, 7 were in between and the rest went short.” Donald Tusk, the European Council President, warned Mrs May not to “waste this time” given to her. He refused to rule out another extension though, adding: “I am too old to exclude another scenario.


French President Emmanuel Macron is “tempted” to let Brexit Britain leave the European Union with no deal to deliver a “lesson to the eurosceptic nationalists” standing in the European polls at the end of May, BBC’s Europe Editor Katya Adler has claimed. Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme, Mrs Adler was asked about the prospect of a longer Brexit delay, after the Prime Minister said she would seek a date past April 12 to allow her to speak with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to try to get Britain\'s exit over the line. She said: “They have to come to a unanimous decision to a longer Brexit delay. Mr Macron for one, and he is not alone, questions the Prime Minister’s ability to follow through on her promise yesterday to look for compromise and national unity.
“Mr Macron is tempted to go for a sharp shock of no deal on April 12 as a lesson to the eurosceptic nationalists standing for election in the European parliamentary polls next month. “Don’t forget, he does see himself as Mr Europe.” Adler added: “That said, it is so nuanced here. The bottom line is EU leaders with Germany’s Angela Merkel in the forefront don’t want to have any blame in a no deal Brexit scenario if they can avoid it. “If Theresa May asks leaders for an extension and agrees to EU conditions attached they can’t really say no or there could be a backlash in those European parliamentary elections anyway by European citizens and businesses affected by no deal, which could play into eurosceptic politicians like Marine Le Pen or Matteo Salvini.

“The likely answer for an extension is yes, but there will be EU conditions attached.” Mrs May said she would seek a longer extension past next week to allow talks with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to ensure Britain leaves the EU. But, the move has angered Brexit supporters, with some members of the Conservative Party’s eurosceptic European Research Group claiming it is time for Mrs May to step down. After a mammoth Cabinet meeting discussing the future of Brexit, the Prime Minister reached out to the Labour Party leader to help deliver Britain’s exit from the bloc. Mrs May said: “The ideal outcome of this process would be to agree an approach on a future relationship that delivers on the result of the referendum, that both the leader of the Opposition and I could put to the House for approval and which I could then take to next week\'s European Council.
"However, if we cannot agree on the single unified approach, then we would instead agree a number of options for the future relationship that we could put to the House in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue. "Crucially, the Government stands ready to abide by the decision of the House. But to make this process work, the opposition would need to agree to this too." In response, Mr Corbyn said he would not set any "limits" ahead of the meeting with the Prime Minister, but that his principles ahead of it were to recognise the "needs of the people that elected all MPs to Parliament and the need to avoid the dangers of crashing out". European Research Group (ERG) chairman Mr Rees-Mogg criticised the Prime Minister for planning to collaborate with "a known Marxist" in the Labour leader. He said: “I think getting the support of a known Marxist is not likely to instil confidence in Conservatives. This approach to Government is an unsuccessful one and it also lacks democratic legitimacy.


Emmanuel Macron is expected to be the biggest obstacle to a smooth transition into a longer Brexit extension after the French President signalled he is not ready to agree to a delay without imposing new conditions on the UK. Theresa May travelled to Brussels on Wednesday to attend an emergency meeting with the EU27 to secure their support to postpone Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union until June 30. But addressing the press before the meeting, Mr Macron warned he will not allow Brexit to “get in the way” of the European project.

The French leader said: “I come to this emergency summit with some simple principles.
“The first principle is that we have a European project. It’s been 34 months since the UK referendum was held ad the key for us is that the European project is maintained in its coherence.
"We have, in these 34 months, managed to progress the matter at hand. We have, in these 34 months, managed to make decisions and above all managed to stay united, together.
“I think this union is important but the unity of the European project is still at risk.”

Brexit stands at a stalemate and the lead negotiator from the European Union made a joke about the need to retain “future diversity” by switching to speaking French. He said: “It is not an obligation to speak English, so I will switch to French. Just to give proof of the future diversity we need to keep.”
A call for a customs union with the EU was rejected by just three votes, while a demand for a second referendum was defeated by 12 and a Norway-style deal put forward by Nick Boles by 21. Michel Barnier said the UK now had two options, quit the EU without a deal, or seek an extension to Article 50. Speaking in Brussels, Mr Barnier said: "If the UK Parliament does not vote in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement in the coming days only two options would remain. "Leaving without an agreement or requesting a longer extension of the Article 50 period." He added: "No deal was never our desired or intended scenario.
Brexit news: Michel Barnier switched to French during the press conference
"But the EU is now prepared." He said no deal "becomes day after day more likely". Mr Barnier said: "The UK may ask for another extension. Such an extension would carry significant risks for the EU. "Therefore a strong justification would be needed. "We have always said that we can accept a customs union, or relationship along the style of the Norway model.
It is not an obligation to speak English, so I will switch to French Michel Barnier
"In fact, however, the Political Declaration today can accommodate all of these options already. "It leaves the door open for a variety of outcomes. "But if the UK so wishes we are ready to rework the Political Declaration." The comments came after a dramatic day in the Commons which saw Mr Boles declare that he would no longer sit as a Conservative MP as he blamed the party for refusing to compromise on a means of leaving the European Union. Cabinet is meeting on Tuesday for five hours to thrash out a way forward. The first three hours will be without civil servants, fuelling speculation the senior Tories could use the time to consider a snap election, the timing of the Prime Minister\'s exit from office or to air the bitter grievances between the Leave and Remain wings of the ministerial team.


The European Union are expected to face an uphill battle with growing populist parties across the bloc ahead of the European elections scheduled for May 23-26. French philosopher Bernard-Henry Levi suggested outspoken eurosceptic like Italy\'s Matteo Salvini or French far-right politician Marine Le Pen could receive the backing of "external forces" to further undermine the European project in the run-up to the European vote across the member states. Speaking to Euronews, Mr Levi said: "You have now some political forces who use democracy to ruin democracy, who use elections in order to torpedo the system which makes election possible and who are going to use the European Parliament to corrupt from the inside, to weaken and maybe destroy the European project itself
"You have populist movements all over Europe supported from outside by external force like Mr Putin." Brussels has repeatedly locked horns with Vladimir Putin following the annexation of Crimea to the Russian Federation in 2014 – which sparked retaliation from the bloc through high-pressure sanctions on Moscow imports and exports. Mr Levi also suggested US President Donald Trump, to whom Italian deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini offered a close alliance, could play an important role in firing up support for eurosceptic parties during the European elections. He continued: "The two enemies of European values are linked. READ MORE: Germany whips up anti-Brexit sentiment to destroy eurosceptic views ahead of EU election
EU news: Brussels has been warned of potential Russian interference in the elections
"On one side you have people like Marine Le Pen or Salvini or others, on the other side, you have people like Vladimir Putin or, alas, Donald Trump who are fuelling the internal force." The European People’s Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), historically the strongest in the European Parliament, could see their support eroded by populist and eurosceptic parties. Anti-EU parties are predicted to swoop many of the 705 seats up for grabs. The EPP would lose 34 seats, going from the 217 gained in 2014 to 183, and the S&D as many as 51, from 186 to 135, according to projections made public in February. Groups including Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party and Italy’s leading parties Five Star Movement (M5S) and Mr Salvini’s Lega may see a massive surge in popular support. Anti-immigration Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF), born from the alliance of Mrs Le Pen and Geert Wilders, leader of Dutch Party for Freedom, could gather 22 seats and jump from 37 to 59 MEPs.


Last night EU ambassadors gave the green light to the European Commission to commence talks with Washington. The negotiations will proceed despite protests from Mr Macron over Donald Trump’s decision to quit the Paris Agreement on climate change. Officials in Paris have warned they can’t be supportive of the US trade talks after the country pulled out of the 2015 international climate pact.
“I am not in favour of having new trade deals, in whatever form, with whoever is, with partners that do not have the same climate standards that we have because that would be unfair competition for our companies, our farmers,” said Mr Macron on Thursday. “If we should move forward, I have always been clear, we cannot do it unless we have guarantees.” In what will be the French President’s second Brussels defeat this week, his aides have conceded they have backed handing the Commission the mandate to kickstart the talks. But one Elysee official insisted, in a sign of rebellion, Paris will vote against them at an EU ministerial meeting on Monday.
Emmanuel Macron\'s France plot to block and hold up EU-US trade deal
But the French vote will be meaningless because only a qualified majority is needed to sanction the talks. The source added: “It is a question of values. Europe must be exemplary and firm in its defence of the climate.” Mr Macron is particularly concerned with a US trade deal opening up certain sectors to competition, including farming and fisheries, close to the ‘Yellow Vest’ protest movement they have marred his premiership. Germany has strived to force a compromise that address Paris’ concerns across the table.
Paris has instead signalled it will “continue the fight” after May’s European Parliament elections. “It’s a major issue for the coming months and for the European elections,” the French official said. France will use its MEPs to block and hold any deal done with the US unless its demands over climate and industry are met. The EU-US trade talks will focus on eliminating industrial tariffs after a primary agreement between Mr Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, in Washington last year.


The French President is said to be frustrated with having to be “summoned” to Brussels for yet another emergency Brexit summit, according to a source familiar with the process. France and Belgium are hardening in their position against Britain ahead of next week’s gathering of EU leaders in Brussels.

Prime Minister Theresa May has requested a short extension to the end of June but the EU has instead proposed a 12-month delay to Brexit. In respect to claims Britain could be forced into a year-long extension, Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg called for Britain to deliberately be disruptive if Britain is forced to have a long extension to the Article 50 process. Former French ambassador Pierre Sellal claimed the EU should “not be held hostage of British politics” as he hit out at claims made by Mr Rees-Mogg.
It is not a French fantasy Pierre Sellal
Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he warned: “There would be a risk that the proper functioning of the institutions, of the legitimacy of one of the most important institutions which is the European Parliament, would be at risk. “What we would ask from the UK Government, if we have to consider a possible new delay, is a commitment to behave in a cooperative way and it is not a French fantasy. “We noted some statements made by prominent British politicians saying that, should the UK still be a member state in the months ahead, they consider that the UK has to behave as a very difficult partner.” Mr Sellal said Mr Rees-Mogg’s comments will not encourage the EU 27 to grant another Brexit delay.
Brexit news: Pierre Sellal said EU should
The EU expert said it would be useful to have the demands in writing, before adding that another form of backstop proposal “could be useful”. Mr Sellal joked: “I know this word is a problem in itself and today but I think it will be necessary to have sufficient guarantees.” Mr Rees-Mogg said on Friday morning that “if a long extension leaves us stuck in the EU we should be as difficult as possible”. He added: “We could veto any increase in the budget, obstruct the putative EU army and block Mr Macron’s integrationist schemes.” A European Commission spokesperson hit back at the comments and told reporters in Brussels: “This gentleman is not our interlocutor and I would say then that the principle of sincere cooperation does apply, as Prime Minister May herself makes clear in her letter. “I would also say that this is a hypothetical question because it supposes, or presupposed an extension, which is yet to be seen by our leaders.”

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.

France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r

\t\r
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."
___
9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.
___
8:45 a.m.
A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.


UK, US, and France warn Syria not to use chemical weapons

WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.

ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.

The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.


In a Friday statement, the French Foreign Ministry expressed its "utmost solidarity with the Iranian people" and offered condolences to the family of victims.
\xe2\x80\x9cGiven this situation, and in response to the needs expressed by the Iranian authorities, the Crisis and Support Center of the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs is organizing an emergency humanitarian aid shipment to Iran,\xe2\x80\x9d reads the statement, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cTwelve tons of humanitarian cargo, including 114 motorized pumps, will be sent by air.\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x9cThe first shipment is expected in the coming days,\xe2\x80\x9d highlights the statement.
Exceptionally heavy rains since March 19 have flooded some 1,900 cities and villages across Iran, claiming 56 lives, according to Interior Minister Rahmani Fazli, and causing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage to Iranian agriculture. Floods have affected several provinces in the north and west of the country including, Golestan, Mazandaran, Lorestan, and Khuzestan.
MAH/PR


According to Reuters, the French foreign ministry reacted to the US move in designating Iran\'s IRGC a terrorist organization on Tuesday during an electronic press briefing by saying that France will remain committed to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe urge people to avoid escalating tensions or destabilizing the region,\xe2\x80\x9d the French Foreign Ministry added.
In response to US terrorist designation of IRGC, Iran has put all US troops in the Middle East region on its list of terrorist organizations and has vowed that from now on, it will treat US troops in the region as terrorists.

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.
"The key for us is to remain grouped together," Macron said. "We have a European renaissance to lead. We don\'t want the Brexit problem to block us on this point."
In the end, the EU leaders hammered out a compromise — giving May more time than Macron wanted to give her to steer a departure deal through her country\'s bitterly divided parliament, while simultaneously shaving months off Tusk\'s suggestion.
As Wednesday night ebbed into the wee hours of Thursday, Macron stood his ground, insisting on a shorter delay than Tusk and most other EU nations wanted. May had requested pushing the Brexit deadline back to June 30, but did not object to a longer delay.
Leaders ultimately coalesced around Oct. 31 — Halloween — as the latest Brexit deadline, averting a potentially disruptive no-deal British departure that would have happened Friday if no extension had been agreed.
"We had a very intensive debate," was how German Chancellor Angela Merkel characterized the summit.
Hanging tough in Brussels could also pay domestic political dividends for Macron, projecting strength at a time when he is weakened by yellow vest protesters at home.
"There seem to be those who think it is good politics for Macron at home to stand up to the British," said Anand Menon, professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at Kings College London and Director of the UK in a Changing Europe Initiative. "One of the things that certainly seems to have happened is that he annoyed a lot of people in Brussels last night by what many saw as his unnecessary theatrics."
A senior EU official at the talks acknowledged that it was "a difficult moment" but said the atmosphere remained constructive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the talks.
While May now has until Oct. 31 to find backing for her unloved Brexit withdrawal deal, Britain could still leave earlier if talks with the country\'s opposition Labour Party find a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament.
"I continue to believe we need to leave the EU, with a deal, as soon as possible," May told reporters.
Manfred Weber, a German who leads the biggest group in the European Parliament, said Europe showed "patience and unity" in avoiding a damaging no-deal Brexit. But he added that "the political uncertainty in London has been extended, which risks affecting debates about the future of Europe."
Germany\'s Spiegel Online called the early-morning agreement a "classic Brussels compromise."
"The EU retained its unity on Brexit — albeit only just," it said.
The British press compared the latest Brexit machinations to Wednesday\'s other big news — the publication of the first-ever photograph of a black hole.
"Here\'s another inescapable black hole," The Times wrote under the photo, referencing Britain\'s Brexit impasse.

UK, US, and France warn Syria not to use chemical weapons
WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.


France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.


Former France player apologizes for racist remark on TV
PARIS (AP) — The beIN Sports television network and commentator Daniel Bravo have apologized after Bravo described Strasbourg striker Nuno Da Costa\'s statistics as "not bad for a black."
Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.
Da Costa wrote: "No worries, a tongue slip happens, he works too much. beIN SPORTS, stop mid-week games please."

Former France midfielder Florent Malouda fired on Twitter
ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."
___
9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.
___
8:45 a.m.
A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.


Former France midfielder Florent Malouda fired on Twitter
ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."
___
9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.
___
8:45 a.m.
A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."

Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.
Da Costa wrote: "No worries, a tongue slip happens, he works too much. beIN SPORTS, stop mid-week games please."

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.
"The key for us is to remain grouped together," Macron said. "We have a European renaissance to lead. We don\'t want the Brexit problem to block us on this point."
In the end, the EU leaders hammered out a compromise — giving May more time than Macron wanted to give her to steer a departure deal through her country\'s bitterly divided parliament, while simultaneously shaving months off Tusk\'s suggestion.
As Wednesday night ebbed into the wee hours of Thursday, Macron stood his ground, insisting on a shorter delay than Tusk and most other EU nations wanted. May had requested pushing the Brexit deadline back to June 30, but did not object to a longer delay.
Leaders ultimately coalesced around Oct. 31 — Halloween — as the latest Brexit deadline, averting a potentially disruptive no-deal British departure that would have happened Friday if no extension had been agreed.
"We had a very intensive debate," was how German Chancellor Angela Merkel characterized the summit.
Hanging tough in Brussels could also pay domestic political dividends for Macron, projecting strength at a time when he is weakened by yellow vest protesters at home.
"There seem to be those who think it is good politics for Macron at home to stand up to the British," said Anand Menon, professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at Kings College London and Director of the UK in a Changing Europe Initiative. "One of the things that certainly seems to have happened is that he annoyed a lot of people in Brussels last night by what many saw as his unnecessary theatrics."
A senior EU official at the talks acknowledged that it was "a difficult moment" but said the atmosphere remained constructive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the talks.
While May now has until Oct. 31 to find backing for her unloved Brexit withdrawal deal, Britain could still leave earlier if talks with the country\'s opposition Labour Party find a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament.
"I continue to believe we need to leave the EU, with a deal, as soon as possible," May told reporters.
Manfred Weber, a German who leads the biggest group in the European Parliament, said Europe showed "patience and unity" in avoiding a damaging no-deal Brexit. But he added that "the political uncertainty in London has been extended, which risks affecting debates about the future of Europe."
Germany\'s Spiegel Online called the early-morning agreement a "classic Brussels compromise."
"The EU retained its unity on Brexit — albeit only just," it said.
The British press compared the latest Brexit machinations to Wednesday\'s other big news — the publication of the first-ever photograph of a black hole.
"Here\'s another inescapable black hole," The Times wrote under the photo, referencing Britain\'s Brexit impasse.

UK, US, and France warn Syria not to use chemical weapons
WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.
"The key for us is to remain grouped together," Macron said. "We have a European renaissance to lead. We don\'t want the Brexit problem to block us on this point."
In the end, the EU leaders hammered out a compromise — giving May more time than Macron wanted to give her to steer a departure deal through her country\'s bitterly divided parliament, while simultaneously shaving months off Tusk\'s suggestion.
As Wednesday night ebbed into the wee hours of Thursday, Macron stood his ground, insisting on a shorter delay than Tusk and most other EU nations wanted. May had requested pushing the Brexit deadline back to June 30, but did not object to a longer delay.
Leaders ultimately coalesced around Oct. 31 — Halloween — as the latest Brexit deadline, averting a potentially disruptive no-deal British departure that would have happened Friday if no extension had been agreed.
"We had a very intensive debate," was how German Chancellor Angela Merkel characterized the summit.
Hanging tough in Brussels could also pay domestic political dividends for Macron, projecting strength at a time when he is weakened by yellow vest protesters at home.
"There seem to be those who think it is good politics for Macron at home to stand up to the British," said Anand Menon, professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at Kings College London and Director of the UK in a Changing Europe Initiative. "One of the things that certainly seems to have happened is that he annoyed a lot of people in Brussels last night by what many saw as his unnecessary theatrics."
A senior EU official at the talks acknowledged that it was "a difficult moment" but said the atmosphere remained constructive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the talks.
While May now has until Oct. 31 to find backing for her unloved Brexit withdrawal deal, Britain could still leave earlier if talks with the country\'s opposition Labour Party find a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament.
"I continue to believe we need to leave the EU, with a deal, as soon as possible," May told reporters.
Manfred Weber, a German who leads the biggest group in the European Parliament, said Europe showed "patience and unity" in avoiding a damaging no-deal Brexit. But he added that "the political uncertainty in London has been extended, which risks affecting debates about the future of Europe."
Germany\'s Spiegel Online called the early-morning agreement a "classic Brussels compromise."
"The EU retained its unity on Brexit — albeit only just," it said.
The British press compared the latest Brexit machinations to Wednesday\'s other big news — the publication of the first-ever photograph of a black hole.
"Here\'s another inescapable black hole," The Times wrote under the photo, referencing Britain\'s Brexit impasse.

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."
___
9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.
___
8:45 a.m.
A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."


Former France midfielder Florent Malouda fired on Twitter
ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."


UK, US, and France warn Syria not to use chemical weapons
WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.


Former France player apologizes for racist remark on TV
PARIS (AP) — The beIN Sports television network and commentator Daniel Bravo have apologized after Bravo described Strasbourg striker Nuno Da Costa\'s statistics as "not bad for a black."
Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.
Da Costa wrote: "No worries, a tongue slip happens, he works too much. beIN SPORTS, stop mid-week games please."

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."


LONDON, April 9 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May updated French President Emmanuel Macron on discussions with the opposition Labour Party aimed at finding a way out the Brexit impasse, her office said on Tuesday.
"The prime minister updated President Macron on the ongoing talks with the Opposition to agree a way forward that respects the result of the 2016 referendum," a spokesman said.
"They also discussed upcoming European Parliamentary elections with the PM saying that the government was working very hard to avoid the need for the UK to take part." (Reporting By Andrew MacAskill; editing by Guy Faulconbridge)


Wonder teen Mary Fowler\'s path to the World Cup will take her to Myanmar this month as she hunts goals to press her claims for France.
As other Australians show their wares in the US-based National Women\'s Soccer League, Spain\'s La Liga, or at home, Fowler\'s youth gives her a different opportunity.
The 16-year-old will head to Southeast Asia under assistant coach Gary van Egmond for the Young Matildas for an Asian qualifying campaign.
Fowler will lead the line for Australia, knowing a bag of goals will do her case for inclusion the world of good.
"It\'s an important tournament for me to show that I am a goalscorer," she said.
"Last time I went into a young Matildas camp I came out golden boot and that\'s exactly what I plan on doing this time."
Playing against lowly-ranked youth sides from Uzbekistan, Nepal and the hosts will certainly be a step down from playing world No.1 USA, as Fowler did last week for her country.
Fowler said it wouldn\'t change her mentality one iota.
"I\'m going to be putting my all in because I want to get to the World Cup," she said.
"I want to be the best in the world so getting to the World Cup is going to be a big stepping stone for me.
"Somewhere I can test myself against the best teams and the best players, I\'m going to do all I can to make sure I get into that squad."
If selected for France, Fowler will become the second-youngest Australian to travel to a World Cup after Caitlin Foord.
Foord, who scored a wonder goal against the USA in the 5-3 loss, was also 16 when she represented the Matildas at the 2011 tournament.
She was named the World Cup\'s best young player and has since moved from a fullback role to become one of the world\'s best forwards.
Sam Kerr is an obvious mentor for the ambitious Fowler, but there\'s something to learn from the entire Matildas camp if she\'s to accomplish her goals.
"You work with everyone and try to learn something from everyone," she said.
"Sure I can say I\'m looking up to Sam, which I am, learning stuff from her, but I\'m also learning stuff from the defence.
"I\'m also a defender as well as an attacker because I defend from the front."


ATHENS, April 9 (Reuters) - Greek airline Sky Express said on Tuesday it had signed an agreement with Air France KLM to cooperate on flights connecting Paris and Amsterdam with the Greek islands.
Tourism accounts for about a quarter of economic output in Greece, which saw a record number of about 33 million visitors last year.
The privately owned carrier, which competes with Aegean Airlines\' subsidiary Olympic Airways on domestic routes, flies to 24 Greek destinations on ATR42 and ATR72 twin engine turboprop aircraft.
Sky Express said the deal would allow passengers to travel across its network with the convenience of a single ticket reservation.
"(This) simplifies travel arrangements for Air France- KLM and Sky Express, since all baggage transfer services are being provided at the connecting airport," Sky Express said.
Air France offers 39 weekly flights to Athens from Paris-Charles de Gaulle, in addition to KLM\'s 14 weekly flights from Amsterdam-Schiphol. (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)


An unaccompanied migrant claiming to be 16 years old so he could claim asylum in France has been exposed as a 47-year-old man.
The man had presented himself to police in the town of Angouleme, around 70 miles north of Bordeaux, on Wednesday last week.
In order to back up his claim, he presented officers with a birth certificate which purported to show he was born in Guinea in 2002.\xc2\xa0
A man claiming to be a 16-year-old from guinea presented himself to this police station in France, before being exposed as a 47-year-old
But investigators made contact with Spanish authorities, suspecting that he may have arrived in that country first before crossing into France, Sud-Ouest reports.
Officers in Spain confirmed they were aware of the man\'s identity and presented their French counterparts with a copy of his passport that he had used to apply for a visa there in 2017.
The passport confirmed the man was 47 years old, more than three decades older than he had claimed.
French police rejected his asylum claim, ordered him to leave the prefecture and placed him in a detention center in Rennes.
The previous day another migrant, claiming to be a 16-year-old from Mali, had approached the same police station.
The incident happened in the town of Angouleme, where just a day before another man had appeared claiming to be a 16-year-old from Mali when in fact he was 21
A similar check with Spanish authorities revealed he was, in fact, 21.
Under French law, the state has a responsibility to care for all unaccompanied minor migrants, whether they have applied for asylum or not, until they turn 18.
In order to claim accommodation and schooling, minors must apply to the\xc2\xa0child social assistance service which will assess their age and whether they are genuinely unaccompanied.\xc2\xa0
If a minor wishes to stay in France after they turn 18, they must then apply for asylum which will be dealt with by a different agency.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0


BRUSSELS, April 10 (Reuters) - Germany, France, Luxembourg and the EU\'s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier favoured a short delay of the date of Britain\'s departure in talks on the eve of a summit of EU leaders in Brussels, officials said.
Those backing a shoter respite for Britain said it would keep up the pressure on the factious House of Commons to ratify the stalled EU exit deal.
The Netherlands and the Czech Republic preferred a longer postponment, saying it could scare staunch Brexit supporters in Britain into backing the exit deal over fear their project might never materialise at all.
Barnier also said, should the UK opt for a customs union with the EU after Brexit, it would solve the problem of customs checks on the sensitive Irish border, but industry regulation checks would still be required, the officials said.
They were describing a preparatory ministerial meeting in Luxembourg a day before EU leaders meet in Brussels on Wednesday to decide on a second Brexit delay, with France pushing the hardest line among the bloc\'s members.

PARIS (AP) - Kristina Mladenovic, Caroline Garcia, Pauline Parmentier and Alize Cornet have been named in France\'s Fed Cup team for the semifinals against Romania.
France will host the best-of-five series on clay in the Normandy city of Rouen from April 20-21.
Romania, which upset defending champion Czech Republic in the previous round, won its only other Fed Cup meeting with France in 1976. The French are trying to qualify for a sixth final, while Romania never advanced past the semifinals.
The other semifinal pits Australia against Belarus.

PARIS (AP) - Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties - as well as others on Europe\'s right - could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.

Another football race row erupted in France on Wednesday evening when a TV pundit described a goal as being \'not bad for a black guy\'.
Former France international Daniel Bravo was working for beIN Sports when he made the controversial remark about Nuno Da Costa\'s strike against Reims.
His words sparked outrage among viewers just 24 hours after Juventus striker Moise Kean was subjected to vile racist taunts during his side\'s win at Cagliari.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0

Da Costa scored twice for Strasbourg on Wednesday, including this penalty to make it 4-0
Bravo, who made 13 appearances for France and played for likes of PSG, Monaco and Nice as a midfielder, went to find Da Costa after the final whistle.
He said sorry for his comment, which came after Da Costa had opened the scoring in Strasbourg\'s 4-0 victory at the Meinau Stadium.
The 28-year-old was quick to accept Bravo\'s apology and immediately took to Twitter to share a photo of himself shaking hands with the commentator.
Alongside the image, Da Costa wrote: \'No worries, a slip of the tongue happens, he works too much! @beinsports_EN stop the games in the middle of the week please.\'\xc2\xa0
Bravo, pictured playing for Monaco in 1983, earned 13 caps for France and also played for PSG

beIN SPORTS also issued an apology. In a statement they said: \'beIN SPORTS and its consultant apologise for the remarks made during the Strasbourg-Reims match, which can be considered shocking and are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial staff.
\'beIN SPORTS recalls that it fights against all forms of discrimination, in particular racism, and promotes diversity, equality and respect through all its broadcasts.\'
The incident came just a day after Leonardo Bonucci controversially claimed that his Juventus team-mate Kean was partly to blame for the racist abuse he suffered on Tuesday night.\xc2\xa0
The Italian defender has since backtracked on his comments, saying his his \'words have been clearly misunderstood\'.\xc2\xa0

Three of rugby\'s great institutions have found themselves in a real muddle over their recruitment of a head coach.
England, France and Leicester Tigers are all suffering from a lack of clarity around who is currently coaching them, and who will be next year.
The common theme is people at the top not being qualified or accountable to make the most important decision: picking the man with the responsibility for the success or failure of their team.
The process for replacing England coach Eddie Jones has become unnecessarily messy
Let\'s start with England, who seem in yet another mess over who will take the head coach job after the World Cup.
After the 2015 World Cup, Twickenham identified Eddie Jones following his Japan side\'s wonderful win over South Africa, and they successfully prised him from the Stormers.
It has been an extraordinary ride ever since and England have every chance of being successful some four years later. That said, on the eve of the World Cup, we have public commentary from stand-in chief executive Nigel Melville about how the RFU will replace Jones if things do not go to plan.
If I were Jones I\'d go ballistic. They should back him before they review his position after the World Cup.
Rugby is becoming very short-term focused at the moment. All this talk of Warren Gatland taking the England job - what if Wales lose to Australia at the World Cup? Suddenly he isn\'t a superstar coach, it\'s as fickle as that.
RFU chief executive Nigel Melville wants to lead the search for Jones\' successor as coach
The RFU don\'t have a stellar track record in hiring or firing coaches. Andy Robinson, Brian Ashton, Martin Johnson and Stuart Lancaster were all installed with no real co-ordinated process. There is a much bigger picture that you must look at when appointing the coach, which the RFU don\'t seem to grasp because no one is remotely qualified to make these decisions.
Rob Andrew appointed Johnson, Ian Ritchie appointed Lancaster and Jones and it seems Melville wants to lead on the decision on the next coach, despite having zero qualifications to make this appointment.\xc2\xa0
Incoming Bill Sweeney may not arrive from the British Olympic Association until the World Cup \xe2\x80\x94 he should be completely involved when he starts. My advice to them all is calm down, reflect on what happens in Japan, there is no rush.
There seems to be a total lack of responsibility among these guys. They have to be accountable. If they won\'t take any responsibility then they should not be involved.
Geordan Murphy was parachuted in by Leicester but does not have the experience to be a No 1
Leicester have similar problems. Who will put their hand up and say they made the decision to hire and fire Richard Cockerill, Aaron Mauger and Geordan Murphy?
Like the RFU, what qualifications do those involved actually have to appoint a coach? I am a former Leicester player, former board member and a fan \xe2\x80\x94 I would love to know who is making these coaching decisions, and why.
Tigers are in a hole and have brought in Mike Ford, who is an excellent coach, but it feels like they are clutching at straws. It\'s an incredibly tough ask for him to turn everything round \xe2\x80\x94 shown by their 52-20 defeat by Exeter. He is not the head coach.
That is Murphy, who was parachuted in when the Tigers sacked Matt O\'Connor after one game of the season, a big call. He has never had the full responsibility of being in sole charge of a team of this magnitude.\xc2\xa0
The difference in skills between being an assistant and the main man is vast. Murphy is a good coach, but does not have the experience to be a No 1 \xe2\x80\x94 he was not even given a pre-season to embed ideas.
Parachuting coaches in exposes them horribly. Of course they\'ll take the job if it\'s the opportunity of a lifetime, but when it doesn\'t work out the people who put them in this position get off scot free.
Leicester have one of the best back lines I have seen on paper, but they could well go down, which could be a disaster for England.
There is debate over whether a foreign coach should replace France boss Jacques Brunel
France are in a similar mess. The FFR have said they are going to hold a referendum among all their clubs to ask whether there would be support for a foreign coach to replace incumbent Jacques Brunel. The answer to their problems is staring them in the face.
I watched the Racing 92 v Toulouse Champions Cup quarter-final last weekend and saw two sets of great young coaches putting together two exceptional sides who contributed to a great spectacle.
Racing have a coaching duo of Laurent Travers and Laurent Labit, and Toulouse have Ugo Mola. The teams put on a display I have not seen from any English club for a long time. It was a class above the Premiership.
All those coaches are backs too, who I\'ve always thought make the best top men. Travers, Labit and Mola have good records and have earned the right to coach those teams.
France are not short of top coaches \xe2\x80\x94 they don\'t necessarily need a top international big-hitter, just someone who understands the differences between the club and Test games.
The one nation that does this well is New Zealand. It is like a business, and former players, like Sean Fitzpatrick, regard themselves as passionate shareholders in the All Blacks. They will not allow a bad decision to be made.
It\'s not one man\'s whim, it\'s a thorough process. This is how top businesses treat recruitment. If you were a shareholder of England, Leicester or France you wouldn\'t accept the decision process. Still in rugby there are too many examples of the game living in the amateur era.


The Prince of Wales received a first-hand account of the horrors of D-Day yesterday as he was introduced to Britain\xe2\x80\x99s most indefatigable fundraiser who told him: \xe2\x80\x98The whole place was awash with blood.\xe2\x80\x99
The Duke of Cornwall was in his duchy in St Austell, where he was introduced to Normandy veteran and local celebrity Harry Billinge.
The prince is royal patron of the Normandy Memorial Trust, dedicated to honouring the 22,442 members of the British Armed Forces who gave their lives there in 1944. Harry spends his life campaigning on behalf of the project in his local area.
Having heard about his efforts, the prince was keen to arrange a meeting during his visit yesterday. The royal visitor had clearly been well briefed.
\xe2\x80\x98I gather you used to blow things up,\xe2\x80\x99 the prince remarked. \xe2\x80\x98I was very good at that once upon a time,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Harry, 93, who was part of a Royal Engineers crack unit charged with demolishing a German radar station near Arromanches on the morning of D-Day. Of his ten-man unit, only four survived.

Harry, who is\xc2\xa0Britain\xe2\x80\x99s most indefatigable fundraiser, has spent his life campaigning for the\xc2\xa0Normandy Memorial Trust. Pictured: the planned new D-Day memorial in Ver-sur-Mer
\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk too much about it. I told the prince that I never wanted to kill anyone but our boys were being baptised in their own blood. He just shook his head.\xe2\x80\x99
Much of the prince\xe2\x80\x99s private 25-minute meeting with Harry and his wife Sheila concerned the progress of the memorial appeal, backed by the Daily Mail and its readers.
Harry explained how much the project meant to the veterans and relatives of those who never returned. \xe2\x80\x98The prince was absolutely lovely and genuinely interested in what we are doing. He\xe2\x80\x99s as keen on this memorial as we are.\xe2\x80\x99
All British servicemen killed on D-Day and in the brutal Battle of Normandy which followed will have their names engraved on the new memorial, thanks to the generosity of Daily Mail readers and the persistence of veterans like Harry \xe2\x80\x93 men whose final, burning ambition is to see this thing finally unveiled.
Of all the Allied nations which took part in the D-Day landings, paving the way for the liberation of Europe, the UK is the only one without a national memorial on French soil. That is why the Mail is campaigning to find the last \xc2\xa37.5million needed to complete a tribute that is long overdue.
On the 75th anniversary of D-Day \xe2\x80\x93 June 6 \xe2\x80\x93 the memorial site will be inaugurated, in front of veterans and VIPs, including royalty and world leaders.
Harry, 93, was part of a Royal Engineers crack unit charged with demolishing a German radar station near Arromanches on the morning of D-Day
There could hardly be a more timely reminder that there are some bonds which predate our marriage to \xe2\x80\x93 and divorce from \xe2\x80\x93the European Union. They are bonds which will endure long after today\xe2\x80\x99s politicians have quit the stage. We might be leaving the EU, but we can never leave Europe proper when it is strewn with the remains of those who died to make it free.
It will take at least another year to finish the task of building this peerless monument on a 50-acre site overlooking the beaches where so many perished.
This week, though, the engraving process has begun. Every name will be carved alphabetically by Service (including Merchant Navy, SOE and other units) and then in date order on columns of a carefully-sourced French limestone called Massangis. All the engraving, however, will be done by S McConnell & Sons, the stonemasons who produced London\xe2\x80\x99s superb Bomber Command Memorial. The first lorryload of limestone has already arrived at the McConnells\xe2\x80\x99 workshop at the foot of the Mourne mountains in Northern Ireland. I was there a few days ago to see an 18-ton chunk of rock cut down to a series of half-ton rectangular blocks by a rotating saw the size of a tractor wheel. The blocks will form columns around a central memorial court which, from above, will resemble the Union flag.
There is no scope for error when the diamond-tipped tungsten drill is carving names straight on to solid stone.
\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a few sleepless nights along the way,\xe2\x80\x99 admits Alan McConnell, the third-generation stonemason in charge of a project which will take a team of six a year to complete. Due to the carefully-planned installation of the memorial columns, the first batch of names to be carved have actually been those of men who died on June 7, 1944, starting with the Royal Navy.
As a result, the very first name to be engraved on the memorial has been that of Leading Seaman Frederick Alexander. He was a member of the crew of Tank Landing Craft 427. They were in the thick of the action on Gold Beach on June 6, 1944 and returned to sea again in one piece. They had just got home to pick up more tanks when they were involved in a collision with the battleship HMS Rodney outside Portsmouth Harbour. All hands \xe2\x80\x93 13 brave men aged between 19 and 37 \xe2\x80\x93 went down with the landing craft.
Harry said:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk too much about it. I told the prince that I never wanted to kill anyone but our boys were being baptised in their own blood. He just shook his head\xe2\x80\x99
They might have died in home waters, victims of a ghastly accident of war. But their loss was no less painful. They all did their duty unflinchingly and paid with their lives. Frederick Alexander and his comrades have no marked grave, their names merely listed on the Royal Naval memorial at Chatham in Kent. Thanks to the Normandy Memorial, they will now be properly recognised and honoured for their valiant part in the liberation of an entire continent.
That is precisely why Harry is out in all weathers with his tin in St Austell\xe2\x80\x99s high street. When I join him for an afternoon of tin-rattling, passers-by of all ages stop to give him something. \xe2\x80\x98This country owes a hell of a lot to those men,\xe2\x80\x99 said Richard Wedgwood, 58, making a donation.
Harry was one of a team of ten Royal Engineers who came ashore on Gold Beach at dawn on D-Day, charged with blowing up a German radar station behind Arromanches.
\xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99d been well dug in for four years and they weren\xe2\x80\x99t about to give it up,\xe2\x80\x99 recalled Harry.
\xe2\x80\x98I was carrying the gelignite and we did it. But only four of us came out.\xe2\x80\x99
As he himself likes to point out, he was always a little \xe2\x80\x99un. \xe2\x80\x98I was the only man in the British Army who could hide behind a blade of grass,\xe2\x80\x99 he jokes.
But in his green beret and a blazer heaving with medals, he is the most commanding presence here on the high street.
\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s the boss,\xe2\x80\x99 joked one of the team in the local branch of Tui travel agents, bringing out the campaign banner which Harry stores in their cupboard. A green-haired youth on a skateboard stops to put something in his tin. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a hero, him,\xe2\x80\x99 says the boy. It is particularly touching to see the local busker chipping in.
Miguel Fernandez comes up to give Harry some of his day\xe2\x80\x99s takings at the end of an afternoon of guitar-strumming. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a great character, always here whatever the weather,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miguel.
Recent days may have been a dispiriting affair for this country. What a profoundly uplifting contrast, then, to see the ordinary people flocking around Harry, a true giant of our times, on a British high street.\xc2\xa0


PARIS, April 2 (Reuters) - Investment company Searchlight Capital Partners has agreed to buy a 26 percent stake in French aeronautics company Latecoere for around $106.8 million, in the latest example of activist funds targeting French companies.
Searchlight Capital said it would buy the stakes in Latecoere held by Apollo Capital Management, Monarch Alternative Capital and CVI Partners, at a price of 3.85 euros per share.
Latecoere shares closed at 3.13 euros on April 1, giving the company a market capitalisation of around 300 million euros ($336 million).
Latecoere had cut its earnings outlook last December after start-up costs related to new contracts hit its margins and cash flow, although the company\'s latest set of results earlier this month showed signs of a recovery.
Latecoere said it welcomed Searchlight\'s move and Searchlight\'s presence on its board of directors.
"The company welcomes this proposed transaction, Searchlight having shown on this occasion its support for the strategy proposed by management and approved by the board of directors and confirms that Searchlight will propose three candidates to be approved by the board of Directors to join the board of directors," Latecoere said in a statement.

Le Drian\'s discussions with Japan\'s foreign minister came after a Japanese court ruled that Carlos Ghosn must remain in custory until at least April 14
France\'s foreign minister on Saturday urged Tokyo to ensure consular protection and the presumption of innocence in talks with his Japanese counterpart over the case of Carlos Ghosn, after the re-arrest of the former Nissan and Renault boss in Japan.
Jean-Yves Le Drian said he had talked about the Ghosn case with Taro Kono on the sidelines of the meeting of Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers in the French resort of Dinard.
Their talks came a day after a Japanese court ruled Ghosn must remain in custody until at least April 14 following his re-arrest in Tokyo.
"I of course spoke about the the Ghosn case with my colleague," Le Drian told reporters after the end of the G7 meeting.
"I told him two things: That France respects completely the sovereignty and independence of the Japanese judiciary. And I also reminded him of our attachment to the presumption of innocence and the full rights of consular protection."
Ghosn spent 108 days in detention in northern Tokyo before being dramatically released on bail of around $9 million on March 6.
But his re-arrest last week came as authorities look into new allegations that Ghosn transferred some $15 million in Nissan funds between late 2015 and mid-2018 to a dealership in Oman.
In an interview with French television recorded just before his latest arrest, the businessman, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese nationalities, called on the French government "to defend me," and press the Japanese authorities respect the presumption of innocence.
Ghosn had long been lauded as the architect of the alliance between Renault and Nissan -- and later Mitsubishi -- before his shock arrest in Tokyo in November.


The tug of war between Australia and France for the loyalty of Sasha Zhoya is set to go to the next level with the multi-skilled teen sensation producing a swag of remarkable displays at the national athletics championships.
Zhoya won his third gold medal on Friday, clocking a 16-year-old world best to win the under-18 110m hurdles in 13.05 seconds.
Earlier in the meet, he was just as dominant in winning the under-20 200m and pole vault, with his best vault clearance of 5.65m only seven centimetres shy of the qualifying standard for the world championships.
Zhoya was born in Perth, has lived his whole life in Australia and considers himself an Australian.
But his mother is from France, French was the first language he learnt as a toddler and the French athletics federation can dangle the tantalising prospect of a home Olympics in Paris in 2024.
"They\'re both offering some amazing things," said Zhoya.
"I want to keep a clear head and leave that decision until later in the year.
"I wish I had something more (to say) because it would make my life easier as well.
"Right now it\'s stressful; I\'m trying to put it in the back of my mind and not think about it during comps.
"But it\'s definitely popping into my head every 30 seconds."
Zhoya has to decide by December which country he will represent at the 2020 world junior championships - and potentially the Tokyo Olympics.
His other big decision is which event he will end up specialising in.
"I\'ve got absolutely zero clue at the moment," said Zhoya.
"It depends how my body progresses and how I progress.
"Anything can happen - injury could cut out one event so I want to keep the three events for the time being."
Having cut a swathe through the junior events at the nationals at Sydney Olympic Park, Zhoya switched his attention to the open-age events.
He eased into the 100m semis on Friday night in 10.66 and then went straight to the men\'s pole vault qualifying round.
ACT runner Edward Nketia was the fastest 100m heat winner in 10.39, with big guns Rohan Browning, Jack Hale and Trae Williams all keeping their powder dry while advancing to the semis on Saturday.
Maddie Coates topped the qualifiers in the opening round of the women\'s 100m in 11.75, with Riley Day fifth quickest in 11.89.


WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged France in a meeting with his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian on Thursday not to approve a digital services tax, saying it would hurt U.S. technology firms, the U.S. State Department said.
France and Britain as well as Italy and Spain are pushing ahead with plans for such taxes after EU countries failed to reach an agreement for the bloc as a whole.
"Secretary Pompeo urged France not to approve a digital services tax, which would negatively impact large U.S. technology firms and the French citizens who use them," the State Department said after Pompeo met Le Drian on the sidelines of a NATO ministerial meeting Washington.

PARIS, April 11 (Reuters) - France has asked the European Union to amend and strengthen a statement on the bloc\'s position concerning eastern Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar\'s offensive on Tripoli.
It also denied that Paris had blocked an EU statement on Libya.
French foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said France wanted the text to be reinforced in three areas - the status of migrants, the involvement in the fighting in Libya of groups under U.N. sanctions for terrorism, and ways to reach a U.N.-backed political solution.

Wonder teen Mary Fowler\'s path to the World Cup will take her to Myanmar this month as she hunts goals to press her claims for France.
As other Australians show their wares in the US-based National Women\'s Soccer League, Spain\'s La Liga, or at home, Fowler\'s youth gives her a different opportunity.
The 16-year-old will head to Southeast Asia under assistant coach Gary van Egmond for the Young Matildas for an Asian qualifying campaign.
Fowler will lead the line for Australia, knowing a bag of goals will do her case for inclusion the world of good.
"It\'s an important tournament for me to show that I am a goalscorer," she said.
"Last time I went into a young Matildas camp I came out golden boot and that\'s exactly what I plan on doing this time."
Playing against lowly-ranked youth sides from Uzbekistan, Nepal and the hosts will certainly be a step down from playing world No.1 USA, as Fowler did last week for her country.
Fowler said it wouldn\'t change her mentality one iota.
"I\'m going to be putting my all in because I want to get to the World Cup," she said.
"I want to be the best in the world so getting to the World Cup is going to be a big stepping stone for me.
"Somewhere I can test myself against the best teams and the best players, I\'m going to do all I can to make sure I get into that squad."
If selected for France, Fowler will become the second-youngest Australian to travel to a World Cup after Caitlin Foord.
Foord, who scored a wonder goal against the USA in the 5-3 loss, was also 16 when she represented the Matildas at the 2011 tournament.
She was named the World Cup\'s best young player and has since moved from a fullback role to become one of the world\'s best forwards.
Sam Kerr is an obvious mentor for the ambitious Fowler, but there\'s something to learn from the entire Matildas camp if she\'s to accomplish her goals.
"You work with everyone and try to learn something from everyone," she said.
"Sure I can say I\'m looking up to Sam, which I am, learning stuff from her, but I\'m also learning stuff from the defence.
"I\'m also a defender as well as an attacker because I defend from the front."


WASHINGTON (AP) - Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.


Around 3,000 foreign children from 43 countries are housed at the Al-Hol camp in Syria, according to the UN
France has ruled out the repatriation of French jihadists and their families detained in Syria after the fall of the Islamic State group\'s "caliphate", Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said Friday.
France and other European nations have been wrestling with how to handle the hundreds of foreign fighters, many of whom are being held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces which led the final push against IS.
French daily Liberation reported Friday that in early March the government had been ready to bring home around 250 men, women and children before abandoning the plan given public hostility to the repatriations.
The issue is extremely sensitive in France, where a deadly 2015 attack on the capital claimed by IS killed 130 people and set off a wave of other deadly assaults since then.
"It\'s logical that our services considered all hypotheses. This was one of the hypothesis they prepared," Castaner said at a press conference following a meeting of G7 interior ministers in Paris.
"No communal repatriation was under consideration to be carried out," he said, reiterating that France would nonetheless study bringing back children of jihadist fighters on a "case-by-case basis".
He denied Liberation\'s claim that France\'s policy with regards to fighters in Syria was being dictated by public opinion.
Last month, French authorities for the first time brought home five orphaned children of French jihadists\' from camps in northeast Syria.
According to the UN children\'s agency UNICEF, around 3,000 foreign children from 43 countries are housed at the Al-Hol camp in Syria alone, which has taken in most of the people fleeing IS\'s self-proclaimed "caliphate" in recent weeks.
Up to 1,700 French nationals are thought to have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight with the jihadists between 2014 and 2018, according to government figures. Around 300 are believed to have died in combat.
Kurdish officials have warned they do not have the resources to hold all the captured fighters indefinitely, and Washington is also urging its allies in the anti-IS coalition to take home their citizens.
But repatriation is a politically fraught issue, and governments fear they may not have enough evidence to convict IS members who claim they did not fight.

PARIS, April 10 (Reuters) - France will propose a new "growth contract" with its euro zone partners to encourage northern countries in the bloc to invest more and for southern countries to undertake further reforms, its finance minister said on Wednesday.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he would make the proposal to his euro zone counterparts on Thursday on the sidelines of a G7 meeting in Washington.
"We can\'t just stand there with our arms crossed in the face of the marked and worrying global slowdown," Le Maire told a French parliamentary finance commission.
"I think euro zone finance and economy ministers have a responsibility to take action," he added.
The global economic outlook has dimmed rapidly in recent months amid trade tensions and Brexit worries, the International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday, downgrading its outlook for the third time since October.
Growth is slowing in regional powerhouse Germany as well as Italy, while it is proving more resilient in France. The IMF forecast growth in Germany this year at 0.8 percent and Italy at only 0.1 percent, while France was seen at 1.3 percent.
Le Maire said the proposed new "growth contract" would consist of reforms in countries with weak competitiveness in exchange for more public investment in countries with less budget strains, like Germany, Finland and the Netherlands.
France has long called for more public investment in northern Europe, but its appeals have largely been ignored.
As economy minister at the time, President Emmanuel Macron urged Germany in 2014 to spend an additional 50 billion euros ($56 billion) on investments to support the European economy.
Le Maire insisted he was not simply reiterating such calls for more spending from Germany, as France was pushing ahead with reforms of its economic model.
"But solidarity requires that they make the necessary public investments so that overall the euro zone does better. If it is everyman for himself, there is no point in being in a monetary union," he said.
Le Maire said his plan also relied on more efforts to protect the euro zone against a future crisis, such as having a shared budget to reduce economic divergences, finalising a planned backstop for bad bank loans and better integration of financial markets.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has estimated that a co-ordinated package of reforms and fiscal stimulus in the euro zone could boost growth by 0.5 percentage points over the next three years.

DINARD, France, April 5 (Reuters) - France offered a wary welcome to foreign ministers from the Group of Seven on Friday for a meeting overshadowed by a snub from Donald Trump\'s U.S. administration, a meltdown in Britain over Brexit and months of anti-government protests at home.
Protesters spray-painted slogans attacking President Emmanuel Macron in the sleepy coastal resort of Dinard where the ministers were due to gather to set the agenda for their leaders at the annual big power summit in August.
Workers at dawn scrubbed furiously at walls daubed with "Thieving banks," "Revolution" and "No to the G7," slogans which mirrored the anger vented across France in more than five months of anti-government "yellow vest" protests.
French diplomats say they have scaled back their ambitions for their presidency of the club of big rich countries, after Trump backed out of a joint communique at last year\'s summit in Canada and criticized Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will not attend and is sending a deputy. One seasoned diplomat in Paris said Pompeo had sent a message that he had "better things to do."
Still, the agenda includes important issues from cyber security and foreign interference in democracies, to countering trafficking in the Sahel and inequality.
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he would call on his European counterparts to support his government\'s request for a further delay to Britain\'s exit from the EU, scheduled to take place in a week unless EU countries agree an extension.
Prime Minister Theresa May has been unable to pass her withdrawal agreement in parliament. Hunt said the G7 was proof Britain was not pulling back from a leading international role.
"The UK\'s involvement in the G7 is vital for our collective security and prosperity as we seek to protect the rules-based international system," he said. "Be in no doubt that once Brexit has happened, the UK will remain a global power."
Along with the United States, France and Britain, the group includes Japan, Germany, Italy, Canada and the European Union. The ministerial meeting is meant to ensure that when the leaders convene in Biarritz in August, they are largely in agreement.
But tensions between the United States and its European allies, particularly over trade, climate change and the nuclear deal with Iran, have meant that where they were once largely in accord, they now seek the lowest common denominator.

The Prince of Wales received a first-hand account of the horrors of D-Day yesterday as he was introduced to Britain\xe2\x80\x99s most indefatigable fundraiser who told him: \xe2\x80\x98The whole place was awash with blood.\xe2\x80\x99
The Duke of Cornwall was in his duchy in St Austell, where he was introduced to Normandy veteran and local celebrity Harry Billinge.
The prince is royal patron of the Normandy Memorial Trust, dedicated to honouring the 22,442 members of the British Armed Forces who gave their lives there in 1944. Harry spends his life campaigning on behalf of the project in his local area.
Having heard about his efforts, the prince was keen to arrange a meeting during his visit yesterday. The royal visitor had clearly been well briefed.
\xe2\x80\x98I gather you used to blow things up,\xe2\x80\x99 the prince remarked. \xe2\x80\x98I was very good at that once upon a time,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Harry, 93, who was part of a Royal Engineers crack unit charged with demolishing a German radar station near Arromanches on the morning of D-Day. Of his ten-man unit, only four survived.

Harry, who is\xc2\xa0Britain\xe2\x80\x99s most indefatigable fundraiser, has spent his life campaigning for the\xc2\xa0Normandy Memorial Trust. Pictured: the planned new D-Day memorial in Ver-sur-Mer
\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk too much about it. I told the prince that I never wanted to kill anyone but our boys were being baptised in their own blood. He just shook his head.\xe2\x80\x99
Much of the prince\xe2\x80\x99s private 25-minute meeting with Harry and his wife Sheila concerned the progress of the memorial appeal, backed by the Daily Mail and its readers.
Harry explained how much the project meant to the veterans and relatives of those who never returned. \xe2\x80\x98The prince was absolutely lovely and genuinely interested in what we are doing. He\xe2\x80\x99s as keen on this memorial as we are.\xe2\x80\x99
All British servicemen killed on D-Day and in the brutal Battle of Normandy which followed will have their names engraved on the new memorial, thanks to the generosity of Daily Mail readers and the persistence of veterans like Harry \xe2\x80\x93 men whose final, burning ambition is to see this thing finally unveiled.
Of all the Allied nations which took part in the D-Day landings, paving the way for the liberation of Europe, the UK is the only one without a national memorial on French soil. That is why the Mail is campaigning to find the last \xc2\xa37.5million needed to complete a tribute that is long overdue.
On the 75th anniversary of D-Day \xe2\x80\x93 June 6 \xe2\x80\x93 the memorial site will be inaugurated, in front of veterans and VIPs, including royalty and world leaders.
Harry, 93, was part of a Royal Engineers crack unit charged with demolishing a German radar station near Arromanches on the morning of D-Day
There could hardly be a more timely reminder that there are some bonds which predate our marriage to \xe2\x80\x93 and divorce from \xe2\x80\x93the European Union. They are bonds which will endure long after today\xe2\x80\x99s politicians have quit the stage. We might be leaving the EU, but we can never leave Europe proper when it is strewn with the remains of those who died to make it free.
It will take at least another year to finish the task of building this peerless monument on a 50-acre site overlooking the beaches where so many perished.
This week, though, the engraving process has begun. Every name will be carved alphabetically by Service (including Merchant Navy, SOE and other units) and then in date order on columns of a carefully-sourced French limestone called Massangis. All the engraving, however, will be done by S McConnell & Sons, the stonemasons who produced London\xe2\x80\x99s superb Bomber Command Memorial. The first lorryload of limestone has already arrived at the McConnells\xe2\x80\x99 workshop at the foot of the Mourne mountains in Northern Ireland. I was there a few days ago to see an 18-ton chunk of rock cut down to a series of half-ton rectangular blocks by a rotating saw the size of a tractor wheel. The blocks will form columns around a central memorial court which, from above, will resemble the Union flag.
There is no scope for error when the diamond-tipped tungsten drill is carving names straight on to solid stone.
\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a few sleepless nights along the way,\xe2\x80\x99 admits Alan McConnell, the third-generation stonemason in charge of a project which will take a team of six a year to complete. Due to the carefully-planned installation of the memorial columns, the first batch of names to be carved have actually been those of men who died on June 7, 1944, starting with the Royal Navy.
As a result, the very first name to be engraved on the memorial has been that of Leading Seaman Frederick Alexander. He was a member of the crew of Tank Landing Craft 427. They were in the thick of the action on Gold Beach on June 6, 1944 and returned to sea again in one piece. They had just got home to pick up more tanks when they were involved in a collision with the battleship HMS Rodney outside Portsmouth Harbour. All hands \xe2\x80\x93 13 brave men aged between 19 and 37 \xe2\x80\x93 went down with the landing craft.
Harry said:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk too much about it. I told the prince that I never wanted to kill anyone but our boys were being baptised in their own blood. He just shook his head\xe2\x80\x99
They might have died in home waters, victims of a ghastly accident of war. But their loss was no less painful. They all did their duty unflinchingly and paid with their lives. Frederick Alexander and his comrades have no marked grave, their names merely listed on the Royal Naval memorial at Chatham in Kent. Thanks to the Normandy Memorial, they will now be properly recognised and honoured for their valiant part in the liberation of an entire continent.
That is precisely why Harry is out in all weathers with his tin in St Austell\xe2\x80\x99s high street. When I join him for an afternoon of tin-rattling, passers-by of all ages stop to give him something. \xe2\x80\x98This country owes a hell of a lot to those men,\xe2\x80\x99 said Richard Wedgwood, 58, making a donation.
Harry was one of a team of ten Royal Engineers who came ashore on Gold Beach at dawn on D-Day, charged with blowing up a German radar station behind Arromanches.
\xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99d been well dug in for four years and they weren\xe2\x80\x99t about to give it up,\xe2\x80\x99 recalled Harry.
\xe2\x80\x98I was carrying the gelignite and we did it. But only four of us came out.\xe2\x80\x99
As he himself likes to point out, he was always a little \xe2\x80\x99un. \xe2\x80\x98I was the only man in the British Army who could hide behind a blade of grass,\xe2\x80\x99 he jokes.
But in his green beret and a blazer heaving with medals, he is the most commanding presence here on the high street.
\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s the boss,\xe2\x80\x99 joked one of the team in the local branch of Tui travel agents, bringing out the campaign banner which Harry stores in their cupboard. A green-haired youth on a skateboard stops to put something in his tin. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a hero, him,\xe2\x80\x99 says the boy. It is particularly touching to see the local busker chipping in.
Miguel Fernandez comes up to give Harry some of his day\xe2\x80\x99s takings at the end of an afternoon of guitar-strumming. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a great character, always here whatever the weather,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miguel.
Recent days may have been a dispiriting affair for this country. What a profoundly uplifting contrast, then, to see the ordinary people flocking around Harry, a true giant of our times, on a British high street.\xc2\xa0


PARIS, April 11 (Reuters) - French state-owned investment fund Caisse des Depots, which holds a 2.5 percent stake in Societe Generale, will vote to renew the French bank\'s Chief Executive Frederic Oudea as board member for another four-year term.
"Yes, we will vote to renew the mandate of three members, including Frederic Oudea," Eric Lombard, Caisse des Depots\'s Chief Executive, told Reuters on Thursday.
"The board of Societe Generale will have to designate the Chief Executive," Lombard added.
In March, Societe Generale\'s board recommended shareholders to renew Oudea at next month\'s shareholder meeting.
If the shareholders accept and renew the boardroom membership of Oudea, he will subsequently be confirmed to continue as CEO, the board has said.
SocGen\'s shareholders will also be asked to renew the mandates of two other board members - Gerard Mestrallet and Kyra Hazou.
Oudea is under pressure from investors and analysts after his bank\'s poor performance. The bank announced a cost reduction plan this week, which includes cutting 1,600 jobs. (Reporting by Matthieu Protard; Editing by Inti Landauro)

A herd of white horses galloping through a coastal lake in the south of France have been caught on camera.
The 12 Camargue horses were running through the water as the sun set behind them.
They sent water splashing into the air while speeding through the lake near the French town of Sainte Marie de La Mer, near Montpellier, France.

MILAN (AP) - The Latest on Europe\'s response to mass migration (all times local):
6:05 p.m.
French authorities say 21 migrants have been rescued while trying to reach Britain by crossing the English Channel in small boats.
A regional maritime authority said in a statement Tuesday that a helicopter and coast guard ship retrieved nine migrants from a boat with a dead engine in waters off Calais.
A separate operation rescued 12 migrants, including two children, from another boat off Boulogne-sur-Mer.
The statement says two passengers had mild hypothermia, and all were brought back to France.

Under British pressure, French authorities stepped up efforts to stop Channel crossings by migrants after a surge in attempted trips on one of the world\'s busiest maritime traffic routes.
Migrants from the Mideast and Africa come to Calais to reach Britain, but usually try to get there by jumping onto trucks

10:35 a.m.
The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says drinking water and food is running low onboard its rescue vessel at sea for the sixth day carrying 64 migrants, as Europe haggles over where to provide a safe port.
Sea-Eye said Tuesday that it has informed Malta, the nearest port, of the scarcity of food and water for the migrants, including 12 women, a child and an infant.
The European Union, meanwhile, said it had triggered talks with member states to identify a port and countries to take in the migrants, as the nearest countries, Malta and Italy, have refused to allow port access to any NGO rescue ship.
Sea-Eye spokesman Dominik Reisinger said the "political question about the distribution of the rescued ... overshadows the human rights" of those on board.

PARIS, April 11 (Reuters) - French energy giant Total has merged its Direct Energie and Total Spring retail subsidiaries to become France\'s biggest alternative electricity supplier, as it takes on former monopolies EDF and Engie.
A spokeswoman said the merged subsidiaries would become known as Total Direct Energie and would have a client base of around 4 million in France, with an aim of doubling that by 2022. This would give Total 15 percent of that market.
State-controlled utility EDF remains the dominant force in the French retail power market with around 28.4 million residential and non-residential clients, while alternative suppliers have 9.3 million as of the end of last year, according to data from French energy market regulator CRE data.
The CRE says EDF is losing around 100,000 clients every month to alternative energy providers.
Total is expanding in the retail electricity and gas market and plans become a so-called \'integrated\' player, operating gas-fired, wind, solar and hydro power generation capacity, while also selling power directly to retail clients.
The spokeswoman said the company will initially focus on the French market where it has expanded rapidly following its acquisitions of Belgium\'s Lampiris in 2016, and Direct Energie last year for $1.7 billion.
Total has said it would also look at expanding in other European retail electricity markets once it has consolidated its position in France. It has a small presence in the Belgian, Netherlands, Spanish and British retail power markets. (Reporting by Bate Felix; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta)


ZURICH (AP) - Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

Le Drian\'s discussions with Japan\'s foreign minister came after a Japanese court ruled that Carlos Ghosn must remain in custory until at least April 14
France\'s foreign minister on Saturday urged Tokyo to ensure consular protection and the presumption of innocence in talks with his Japanese counterpart over the case of Carlos Ghosn, after the re-arrest of the former Nissan and Renault boss in Japan.
Jean-Yves Le Drian said he had talked about the Ghosn case with Taro Kono on the sidelines of the meeting of Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers in the French resort of Dinard.
Their talks came a day after a Japanese court ruled Ghosn must remain in custody until at least April 14 following his re-arrest in Tokyo.
"I of course spoke about the the Ghosn case with my colleague," Le Drian told reporters after the end of the G7 meeting.
"I told him two things: That France respects completely the sovereignty and independence of the Japanese judiciary. And I also reminded him of our attachment to the presumption of innocence and the full rights of consular protection."
Ghosn spent 108 days in detention in northern Tokyo before being dramatically released on bail of around $9 million on March 6.
But his re-arrest last week came as authorities look into new allegations that Ghosn transferred some $15 million in Nissan funds between late 2015 and mid-2018 to a dealership in Oman.
In an interview with French television recorded just before his latest arrest, the businessman, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese nationalities, called on the French government "to defend me," and press the Japanese authorities respect the presumption of innocence.
Ghosn had long been lauded as the architect of the alliance between Renault and Nissan -- and later Mitsubishi -- before his shock arrest in Tokyo in November.


When Virginia Hall, pictured, was born on April 6, 1906, espionage seemed the least likely path for the only daughter of one of Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s prominent families. Her mother, Barbara, had hoped for an \xe2\x80\x98advantageous marriage\xe2\x80\x99 to help the family\xe2\x80\x99s dwindling fortune, according to a new book,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98A Woman of No Importance: The Untold Story of the American Spy Who Helped Win World War II\xe2\x80\x99 by Sonia Purnell
The odds of success, let alone survival, were not high for Virginia Hall when she was sent to spy behind enemy lines during World War II.
She was a one-legged, 35-year-old American and a former desk clerk. But she flourished where others failed, and helped to build a Resistance network in France when a Nazi victory seemed inevitable. Along the way, Hall was branded the \xe2\x80\x98most dangerous spy\xe2\x80\x99 by the Germans and the Gestapo hunted her relentlessly.
Hall spoke five languages, went by many code names, and could switch her appearance multiple times in an afternoon. She cultivated contacts, planned a daring and successful prison escape for her fellow agents, and later on during the war \xe2\x80\x93 with the Nazis hot on her heels \xe2\x80\x93 recruited and led guerrilla groups whose sabotage missions of blowing up bridges and cutting off communications helped the Allied effort after D-Day.
A new book, \xe2\x80\x98A Woman of No Importance: The Untold Story of the American Spy Who Helped Win World War II\xe2\x80\x99 by Sonia Purnell, creates a detailed picture of an extraordinary and tenacious woman who long \xe2\x80\x98operated in the shadows,\xe2\x80\x99 and desired no accolades for her bravery. The book is the basis for a slated movie set to star Daisy Ridley.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
\xe2\x80\x98This book is\xe2\x80\xa6 an attempt to reveal how one woman really did help turn the tide of history,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote.
Repeatedly rejected for a diplomatic position with the U.S. State Department, Hall first worked for British intelligence for what was called the Special Operations Executive, using the cover of a New York Post reporter. Later on, she was an agent for the United States\xe2\x80\x99 Office of Strategic Services, which was the forerunner to the Central Intelligence Agency.
American Virginia Hall, pictured above in a sketch and a photo, first worked for British intelligence for what was called the Special Operations Executive, or SOE. \xe2\x80\x98No one in London gave Agent 3844 more than a fifty-fifty chance of surviving even the first few days. For all Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s qualities, dispatching a one-legged thirty-five-year-old desk clerk on a blind mission into wartime France was on paper an almost insane gamble,\xe2\x80\x99 Sonia Purnell wrote in her new book, \xe2\x80\x98A Woman of No Importance: The Untold Story of the American Spy Who Helped Win World War II\'
Hall first set up shop in Vichy in the so-called Free Zone, and set about establishing her bona fides for her cover, a reporter for the New York Post. The \xe2\x80\x98statuesque, flame-haired newcomer with an aristocratic bearing,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote, was able to make inroads, and she became friends with Suzanne Bertillon, who despite working as a censor of foreign press for the Vichy government, helped Hall by setting up contacts throughout the country that provided her with information, which \xe2\x80\x98proved vital for the British war effort,\xe2\x80\x99 such as German troop movements. Above, Hall with Paul Goillot, right, whom she would later marry, and Henry Riley, left, and Lieutenant Aimart, center, in France in 1944
After Vichy, Hall moved to Lyon, where rumblings of rebellion were stirring. \xe2\x80\x98She learned how to change her appearance within minutes depending on whom she was meeting,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote. \xe2\x80\x98Altering her hairstyle, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, putting on glasses, changing her makeup, wearing different gloves to hide her hands, or even inserting slivers of rubber into her mouth to puff out her cheeks: it all worked surprisingly well.\xe2\x80\x99 Recruiting people for the Resistance, and, moreover, then waiting until action was called for was difficult and Purnell noted that Hall\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98early days in Lyon\xe2\x80\x99 were \xe2\x80\x98extremely rough.\xe2\x80\x99 Above, Hall, the only woman center right, with those who were part of the Resistance in France against the Nazis in 1944
Despite the Nazis looking for her, Hall returned to France in March 1944 \xe2\x80\x93 this time working for the United States\' Office of Strategic Services. \xe2\x80\x98The risk involved was just incredible really,\xe2\x80\x99 author Purnell told DailyMail.com. Hall was eventually tasked with recruiting guerrilla groups for sabotage.\xc2\xa0After D-Day on June 6, 1944, when the Allies stormed Normandy in France, Resistance groups were crucial and \xe2\x80\x98created serious military diversions that together with massive Allied bombardment prevented the Wehrmacht (German armed forces) from re-forming against the Allied forces father north and south,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote. Hall\xe2\x80\x99s sabotage missions were \xe2\x80\x98among the more successful at the time,\xe2\x80\x99 according to the book. Above, an example of sabotage during the war. A railway bridge in Chamalieres, France was blown up in August 1944
After the war, despite being a hero with field experience, the CIA would fail, at times, to use her talents properly or promote her as they would a man \xe2\x80\x93 to the point that Hall became the agency\xe2\x80\x99s textbook example of discrimination, according to the book.
\xe2\x80\x98She had a lot of rejection during her own lifetime - unbelievably cruel and misguided and awful,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell told DailyMail.com. \xe2\x80\x98She didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel sorry for herself and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t complain. She was just determined and had such courage and she just kept at it.\xe2\x80\x99
When Virginia Hall was born on April 6, 1906, espionage seemed the least likely path for the only daughter of one of Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s prominent families. Her mother, Barbara, hoped for what Purnell called an \xe2\x80\x98advantageous marriage\xe2\x80\x99 to help the family\xe2\x80\x99s dwindling fortune.
Nicknamed \xe2\x80\x98Dindy,\xe2\x80\x99 Hall once sported a \xe2\x80\x98bracelet\xe2\x80\x99 of live snakes to school, described herself as \xe2\x80\x98cantankerous and capricious,\xe2\x80\x99 and was a natural leader who got elected class president. She was engaged at aged 19, but broke it off and first attended Radcliffe College (now part of Harvard) in 1924, and then transferred to Barnard College the following year, according to the book.
Hall craved a career and her ambition would take her from Barnard, where Purnell remarked she was \xe2\x80\x98an average student,\xe2\x80\x99 to live in Paris, a mecca for American expats like Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, at aged 20. She studied at the Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques, what is now the prestigious Sciences Po, and at the Konsular Akademie in Vienna.
After three years in Europe, Hall spoke French, German, Spanish, Italian and Russian. She was well-versed in its politics, had \xe2\x80\x98a deep and abiding love of France,\xe2\x80\x99 and as Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini were on the rise, \xe2\x80\x98she was thus witness to the dark clouds of nationalism gathering across the horizon,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote.
She came back to Maryland in July 1929 \xe2\x80\x93 months before the stock market crash that was the start of the country\xe2\x80\x99s Great Depression. What remained of her family\xe2\x80\x99s fortune was lost, and Hall went to graduate school at the George Washington University in Washington, DC. She then applied to become a professional diplomat with the U.S. State Department but was rejected, with Purnell noting that they \xe2\x80\x98seemed unwilling to welcome women in their rank.\xe2\x80\x99 It would not be the last time.
Nonetheless, Hall started working for the department as a clerk, first at the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw, then in Turkey. It was in Turkey that her life took a different turn.
In December 1933, Hall had organized a shooting exhibition for a type of bird called a snipe, and somehow, while out in the wetlands, she \xe2\x80\x98stumbled. As she fell, her gun slipped off her shoulder and got caught in her ankle-length coat. She reached out to grab it, but in doing so fired a round at point-blank range into her foot,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote. \xe2\x80\x98The wound was serious.\xe2\x80\x99
Initially, it seemed as if Hall would recover, but \xe2\x80\x98gangrene had taken hold and was fast spreading up her lower leg,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98on the brink of death,\xe2\x80\x99 the doctors amputated her left leg \xe2\x80\x98below the knee in a last-ditch bid\xe2\x80\x99 to save the 27-year-old, she wrote.
The ordeal, however, was not over, and Hall had sepsis, \xe2\x80\x98a potentially life-threatening condition caused by the body\'s response to an infection,\xe2\x80\x99 according to the Mayo Clinic\xe2\x80\x99s website. In a tremendous amount of pain, Hall saw her father, who had died almost three years earlier, at her bedside, telling her \xe2\x80\x9cit was her duty to survive,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the book. Hall pulled through, and her father\xe2\x80\x99s words would stay with her \xe2\x80\x93 especially for the difficult moments that were to come.
Sonia Purnell, the author of a new book, \'A Woman of No Importance: The Untold Story of the American Spy Who Helped Win World War II,\' that chronicles the life of Virginia Hall, told DailyMail.com that she thought Hall \xe2\x80\x98felt embarrassed\xe2\x80\x99 when people wanted to talk about what she did during the war. She wanted to remain undercover and went to work for the CIA. Above, William \'Wild Bill\' Donovan, right, who was the head of the\xc2\xa0United States\xe2\x80\x99 Office of Strategic Services, awards Hall the Distinguished Service Cross on September 27, 1945 in Washington, DC. According to the book, she was the only civilian woman to receive the medal for \'extraordinary heroism against the enemy\'
For the majority of her time behind enemy lines, Virginia Hall, above in an undated self-portrait, was strict about her security protocols and did not have a boyfriend or take a lover, unlike some of her fellow male agents, which led to leaks and other disastrous consequences, according to the book,\xc2\xa0\'A Woman of No Importance.\' \xe2\x80\x98When she went into the field, I think she was quite used to be very self-sufficient, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t need other people in the same way that a lot of the other agents did, which was their downfall,\xe2\x80\x99 author Sonia Purnell told DailyMail.com
Virginia Hall, pictured, spoke five languages:\xc2\xa0French, German, Spanish, Italian and Russian. She studied both in Paris and Vienna, Austria during the 1920s. When she returned to the United States, she went to graduate school in\xc2\xa0Washington, DC. She then applied to become a professional diplomat with the U.S. State Department but was rejected, with Purnell noting in her new book that they \xe2\x80\x98seemed unwilling to welcome women in their rank.\xe2\x80\x99 It would not be the last time. Nonetheless, Hall worked as a clerk at various American embassies
Hall\'s life would take a different turn when she posted to work at the consulate in Turkey. In December 1933, Hall had organized a shooting exhibition for a type of bird called a snipe, and somehow, while out in the wetlands, she accidentally shot herself in the foot. To save the then 27-year-old\'s life, doctors amputated her left leg due to gangrene, according to a new book called\xc2\xa0\'A Woman of No Importance.\' Nonetheless, Hall eventually went back to work, and her first posting after the accident was in Venice. She is seen above making her way around the city sometime in the 1930s
After Hitler invaded Poland on\xc2\xa0September 1, 1939,\xc2\xa0Hall first tried to join the women\xe2\x80\x99s branch of the British army but was denied because she was American. Next, she went to Paris, where she was finally accepted as a volunteer to drive ambulances for the French army, known as SSA, as seen in the inscription above
Hall then attempted to go back to work at the consulate but it was too soon, and in the summer of 1934, she returned to the U.S. She then had \xe2\x80\x98repair operations,\xe2\x80\x99 and was fitted with a new prosthetic that \xe2\x80\x98although modern by 1930s standard, it was clunky and held in place by leather straps and corsetry around her waist,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote, and \xe2\x80\x98despite being hollow, the painted wooden leg with aluminum foot\xe2\x80\x99 weighed eight pounds.
After learning how to walk again with her false leg, which she named Cuthbert, Hall was back in Europe by November, posted to a consulate in Venice. She then worked in Estonia, and, once again, Hall tried to become a diplomat but was turned down.
\xe2\x80\x98Fearful of the future, all hopes of a promotion dashed, pigeonholed as a disabled woman of no importance, she resigned from the State Department in March 1939,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote.
On September 1, 1939, Hitler invaded Poland. After traveling to London, Hall first tried to join the women\xe2\x80\x99s branch of the British army but was denied because she was American. Next, she went to Paris, where she was finally accepted as a volunteer to drive ambulances for a French regiment.
\xe2\x80\x98After her accident, she had been rejected and now she wanted to prove her worth so badly, wanted to prove what she could still do, not what she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell told DailyMail.com about why Hall decide to take an \xe2\x80\x98insane gamble with her life\xe2\x80\x99 to volunteer in wartime France.
Hall was sent to the France\xe2\x80\x99s northeastern border on May 6, near the Maginot Line, which was supposed to deter the Germans from invading with its fortifications and weapons. Four days later, the Nazis went around the Maginot Line and quickly overrun the French. By June 22, Marshal Philippe Petain signed an armistice with Hitler, dividing the country into the Occupied Zone, under German rule, and the \xe2\x80\x98Free Zone\xe2\x80\x99 or Vichy France with Petain as its leader.
A chance encounter in Spain would ultimately led to Hall spying for the British. While on the way to England after the French surrendered to the Nazis, Hall met British spy George Bellows in August 1940, according to the book.
The United States was still staying out of the war at that point, and would not join the Allies until after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Britain alone at that time stood against Hitler, and its spy network in France had collapsed, Purnell noted in her book.
Bellows was impressed by Hall\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98courage under fire, powers of observation, and most of all her unqualified desire to help the French fight back,\xe2\x80\x99 and so he gave her a number to call while in London, according to the book.
\xe2\x80\x98The number was for Nicolas Bodington, a senior officer in the independent French or F section of a new and controversial British secret service,\xe2\x80\x99 she wrote.
\xe2\x80\x98The Special Operations Executive had been approved on July 19, 1940, the day that Hitler had made a triumphant speech at Reichstag in Berlin, boasting of his victories. In response, Winston Churchill had personally ordered SOE to \xe2\x80\x9cset Europe ablaze\xe2\x80\x9d through an unprecedented onslaught of sabotage, subversion, and spying.\xe2\x80\x99
When she arrived in London, it took her some time before she called the number, and Purnell noted that she was loathe to cause her mom \xe2\x80\x98any more angst\xe2\x80\x99 and was headed back to the U.S. However, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a ticket and met Bodington.
Hall snapped up the job Bodington offered, and, Purnell wrote, she \xe2\x80\x98would be the first female F section agent and the first liaison officer of either sex.\xe2\x80\x99
She and the other SOE officers were to build \xe2\x80\x98up a Resistance network from scratch in a foreign land behind enemy lines,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote, however, \xe2\x80\x98no one had really done\xe2\x80\x99 that before. The \xe2\x80\x98early days were marked by repeated failure\xe2\x80\x99 before Hall, according to the book.
She received a modicum of training, learned the basics of coding and \xe2\x80\x98when she could exercise her license to kill.\xe2\x80\x99 For Hall, her preferred method was what she dubbed the pills, \xe2\x80\x98probably the L or Lethal tablets,\xe2\x80\x99 which were \xe2\x80\x98tiny rubber balls containing potassium cyanide\xe2\x80\x99 that could be used in case she was tortured or to kill, according to the book.\xc2\xa0
When Virginia Hall was born on April 6, 1906, espionage seemed the least likely path for the only daughter of one of Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s prominent families. Her mother, Barbara, hoped for what author Sonia Purnell called an \xe2\x80\x98advantageous marriage\xe2\x80\x99 to help the family\xe2\x80\x99s dwindling fortune. Nicknamed \xe2\x80\x98Dindy,\xe2\x80\x99 Hall once sported a \xe2\x80\x98bracelet\xe2\x80\x99 of live snakes to school, described herself as \xe2\x80\x98cantankerous and capricious,\xe2\x80\x99 and was a natural leader who got elected class president, according to the book\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98A Woman of No Importance.\' Above, Virginia Hall, right, with her father, Ned, center\xc2\xa0
Hall spent time at her family\'s farm, called Boxhorn, above, in Maryland. This experience would serve her later on during the war when she had to live on farms in France. Hall was engaged at aged 19, but broke it off and first attended Radcliffe College (now part of Harvard) in 1924, and then transferred to Barnard College the following year, according to a new book called\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98A Woman of No Importance: The Untold Story of the American Spy Who Helped Win World War II\xe2\x80\x99 by Sonia Purnell\xc2\xa0
Hall, above, craved a career and her ambition would take her from Barnard, where Purnell remarked she was \xe2\x80\x98an average student,\xe2\x80\x99 to live in Paris, a mecca for American expats like Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, at aged 20. She studied at the Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques, what is now the prestigious Sciences Po, and at the Konsular Akademie in Vienna\xc2\xa0
After three years in Europe, Hall spoke French, German, Spanish, Italian and Russian. She was well-versed in its politics, had \xe2\x80\x98a deep and abiding love of France,\xe2\x80\x99 and as Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini were on the rise, \xe2\x80\x98she was thus witness to the dark clouds of nationalism gathering across the horizon,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote. On the left, Hall is seen with her older brother John, and, on the right, Hall during her teenage years sporting pigeons as a hat\xc2\xa0
On August 23, 1941, she left for France.\xc2\xa0
\xe2\x80\x98No one in London gave Agent 3844 more than a fifty-fifty chance of surviving even the first few days. For all Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s qualities, dispatching a one-legged thirty-five-year-old desk clerk on a blind mission into wartime France was on paper an almost insane gamble,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote.\xc2\xa0
In France, Hall first set up shop in Vichy in the so-called Free Zone, and set about establishing her bona fides for her cover, a reporter for the New York Post.
The \xe2\x80\x98statuesque, flame-haired newcomer with an aristocratic bearing,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote, was able to make inroads, and she became friends with Suzanne Bertillon, who despite working as a censor of foreign press for the Vichy government, helped Hall by setting up contacts throughout the country that provided her with information, which \xe2\x80\x98proved vital for the British war effort,\xe2\x80\x99 such as German troop movements.
After Vichy, she moved to Lyon, where rumblings of rebellion were stirring. Hall also changed her hair, dyeing it light brown and wearing tweed suits.
\xe2\x80\x98She learned how to change her appearance within minutes depending on whom she was meeting,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote. \xe2\x80\x98Altering her hairstyle, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, putting on glasses, changing her makeup, wearing different gloves to hide her hands, or even inserting slivers of rubber into her mouth to puff out her cheeks: it all worked surprisingly well.\xe2\x80\x99
\xe2\x80\x98With a little improvisation she could be three or four different women \xe2\x80\x93 Brigitte, Virginia, Marie, or Germaine \xe2\x80\x93 within the space of an afternoon.\xe2\x80\x99
Recruiting people for the Resistance, and, moreover, then waiting until action was called for was difficult and Purnell noted that Hall\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98early days in Lyon\xe2\x80\x99 were \xe2\x80\x98extremely rough.\xe2\x80\x99
The SOE sent other agents into France - some had parachuted in - but the new arrivals would make the fateful decision to meet together at one place. The Vichy French police, who were working with the Nazis, arrested them all. Hall, who did not go to the gathering, was left with three other agents, and was working furiously to make up for lost ground, according to the book.
Hall was strict about her security protocols and did not have a boyfriend or take a lover, unlike some of her fellow male agents, which led to leaks and other disastrous consequences.
\xe2\x80\x98When she went into the field, I think she was quite used to be very self-sufficient, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t need other people in the same way that a lot of the other agents did, which was their downfall,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell said.
French dissidents also \xe2\x80\x98talked loudly and proudly,\xe2\x80\x99 and did things like \xe2\x80\x98used their own names,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell noted in the book. (Later on in the war, there would be rivalry in the Resistance between the Communists and those who supported Charles de Gaulle, the leader of Free France, who was then in London.)
\xe2\x80\x98Everyone feared their neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s ears,\xe2\x80\x99 she wrote, noting that there were more than 1,500 denunciations a day.
\xe2\x80\x98She had once been careless in her life, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t she, and she shot her foot off and I mean that very nearly ended her life and it ended a lot of her dreams and hopes. I think she really was determined that she would never be careless again and everything she did would be precise and rehearsed and practiced and planned and prepared,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell explained.
\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s how she survived and that\xe2\x80\x99s how she succeeded.\xe2\x80\x99
In Lyon, Hall was making one of her best contacts: Germaine Guerin, a 37-year-old \xe2\x80\x9cburning brunette\xe2\x80\x9d who partly owned a brothel that was frequented by \xe2\x80\x98German officers, French police, Vichy officials, and industrialists,\xe2\x80\x99 and who had access to important commodities such as gasoline and coal, according to the book.
\xe2\x80\x98Her clients never thought to doubt her motives let alone search her premises,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote. \xe2\x80\x98She agreed to make parts of her brothel and three other flats available as safe houses (heated by her illicit coal).\xe2\x80\x99
Guerin \xe2\x80\x98was to become an unlikely pillar of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s entire Lyon operation and one of its most heroic agents.\xe2\x80\x99
The women who worked at the brothel also stuck out their necks to get information into Hall\xe2\x80\x99s hands \xe2\x80\x93 they \xe2\x80\x98spiked their clients\xe2\x80\x99 drinks to loosen their tongues, and rifled their pockets for interesting papers to photograph when they slept,\xe2\x80\x99 according to the book.
Hall \'had a lot of rejection during her own lifetime - unbelievably cruel and misguided and awful,\xe2\x80\x99 author Sonia Purnell told DailyMail.com. \xe2\x80\x98She didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel sorry for herself and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t complain. She was just determined and had such courage and she just kept at it.\xe2\x80\x99 Above, the Baltimore Sun ran a story in January 1934 about Hall\'s accident in Turkey while she worked for the consulate. Hall accidentally shot herself in the foot, and doctors amputated her leg to save her life
After Hall\'s accident and recovery, she attempted to go back to work at the consulate but it was too soon, and in the summer of 1934, she returned to the U.S. Hall, pictured, then had \xe2\x80\x98repair operations,\xe2\x80\x99 and was fitted with a new prosthetic that \xe2\x80\x98although modern by 1930s standard, it was clunky and held in place by leather straps and corsetry around her waist,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote, and \xe2\x80\x98despite being hollow, the painted wooden leg with aluminum foot\xe2\x80\x99 weighed eight pounds\xc2\xa0
Sonia Purnell, left, told DailyMail.com it was a huge amount of detective work to write about Virginia Hall for her new book, \xe2\x80\x98A Woman of No Importance: The Untold Story of the American Spy Who Helped Win World War II,\xe2\x80\x99 right. \xe2\x80\x98When you\xe2\x80\x99re writing about a secret agent, they don\xe2\x80\x99t make it easy for you, believe me,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, and then laughed
Hall had successfully organized a Resistance circuit, and word got out about Marie Monin, her alias then, in Lyon. She was able to recruit many different people, such the owner of a lingerie shop, who took messages and signaled with how close or far a pair of mended stockings were in a window, and the elderly women who let the Resistance keep supplies at their antique shop, according to the book.
All knew that the \xe2\x80\x98likely price of capture was death,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote.
Hall was perhaps too successful \xe2\x80\x93 the Nazis were on to the fact that there was a spy in Lyon coordinating people against them, albeit they initially thought it was a man. During a later phase of the war, Lyon and its people would pay the price for their insurgency.
She changed her code name from Marie to Isabelle to then Philomene, according to the book, but the Abwehr, German military intelligence, and the \xe2\x80\x98Gestapo were hell-bent \xe2\x80\x93 separately and in tandem \xe2\x80\x93 on hunting down this notorious agent they knew to be somewhere in the city...\xe2\x80\x99
Klaus Barbie, \xe2\x80\x99the Gestapo\xe2\x80\x99s most notorious investigator \xe2\x80\x93 who would within a year be awarded the Iron Cross (reputedly by Hitler himself) for torturing and slaughtering thousands of resistants \xe2\x80\x93 was also taking a personal interest in Virginia.
\xe2\x80\x98The Limping Lady of Lyon was becoming the Nazis\xe2\x80\x99 most wanted Allied agent in the whole of France,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote, referring to Hall\xe2\x80\x99s gait that was due to her false leg, which she called Cuthbert.
The heat got to be too much, and Hall eventually escaped from France to Spain through an arduous journey that included scaling with Cuthbert an 8,000-foot mountain pass in winter. She made it back to London in January 1943, according to the book.
Purnell wrote: \xe2\x80\x98She had set up vast networks, rescued numerous officers, provided top-grade intelligence, and kept the SOE flag flying through all the tumult. She had almost alone laid the foundations of discipline and hope for the great Resistance battles that were to come.\xe2\x80\x99
But she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t done. Despite the Nazis looking for her, Hall returned to France \xe2\x80\x93 this time working for her country\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Strategic Services. She drastically altered her appearance, donning a disguise of an older peasant woman, and even had her teeth ground down, according to the book.
\xe2\x80\x98The risk involved was just incredible really,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell said.
First, Hall was to scout safe houses for other agents, but she then was tasked with recruiting guerrilla groups for sabotage. She ended up in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, which is in a geographically isolated region that is now known for saving thousands of Jewish lives during the war. She would earn the moniker \xe2\x80\x98Madonna of the Mountains,\xe2\x80\x99 according to the book.
After D-Day on June 6, 1944, when the Allies stormed Normandy in France, Resistance groups were crucial and \xe2\x80\x98created serious military diversions that together with massive Allied bombardment prevented the Wehrmacht (German armed forces) from re-forming against the Allied forces father north and south,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote.
\xe2\x80\x98The movies may sometimes give the impression that success on D-Day marked the end of the worst fighting, but across many areas of France, including Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s, it created new challenges of its own. The remaining Germans \xe2\x80\x93 and their French collaborators \xe2\x80\x93 were edgy, afraid, and more brutal than ever.\xe2\x80\x99
Hall\xe2\x80\x99s sabotage missions were \xe2\x80\x98among the more successful at the time,\xe2\x80\x99 according to the book. She would win commendations for her bravery: a Member of the Order of the British Empire, and a Distinguished Service Cross.
\xe2\x80\x98What was amazing about Virginia was that she was behind enemy lines for the best part of three years and she survived. That was extraordinary,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell said.
However, Purnell said that she thought Hall \xe2\x80\x98felt embarrassed\xe2\x80\x99 when people wanted to talk about what she did during the war. She wanted to remain undercover and went to work for the CIA. But she had a \xe2\x80\x98tough life\xe2\x80\x99 at the agency \xe2\x80\x98because she didn\xe2\x80\x99t conform to the 1950s kind of idea of the perfect women. She was almost embarrassing because she had done so much in the field behind enemy lines,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell said.
\xe2\x80\x98She took a lot of flak, but she took some ground as well and she made it possible for future generations to go further than she did.\xe2\x80\x99
Hall met her husband, then Lieutenant Paul Goillot, in 1944 during the war. They were married in 1957, and stayed together until her death on July 8, 1982 at aged 76.
\xe2\x80\x98Constantly throughout her life she was kind of dismissed as a woman of no importance,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell said.
\xe2\x80\x98And yet, as we know, she ended up being a very important women indeed.\xe2\x80\x99
Virginia Hall, left, met her husband\xc2\xa0Paul Goillot, right, in 1944 in France.\xc2\xa0They were married in 1957, and stayed together until her death on July 8, 1982 at aged 76. Above, the couple in an undated photo when they were living in America. After the war, Hall worked for the CIA and the agency would fail, at times, to use her talents properly or promote her as they would a man \xe2\x80\x93 to the point that Hall became the agency\xe2\x80\x99s textbook example of discrimination, according to a new book \xe2\x80\x98A Woman of No Importance\'


Two vegan activists have been jailed for a string of attacks on butchers and restaurants in France that caused millions of euros in damage.\xc2\xa0
In what was described as the first case of its kind in the country, the pair were handed prison sentences for criminal damage to shops, butchers and eateries.\xc2\xa0
The\xc2\xa0\'anti-speciesist\' couple, a 23-year-old youth worker named Cyrile and a 29-year-old employee at a kindergarten called Mathilde, were convicted of criminal damage after breaking windows and starting fires at butchers, fishmongers, restaurants and shops around the Lille area of northern France.
During the trial, Cyrile and Mathilde, who both had no previous criminal record, admitted taking part in nocturnal raids where they broke windows or scrawled slogans like \'Stop Speciesism\' and \'Assassins\' on businesses selling meat.
The activists are from a movement that describes itself as being \'anti-speciesist\', which rejects the idea of humans sitting at the top of the species hierarchy and consuming animals.\xc2\xa0
The 3 Coqs chicken shop in Lille, northern France, had its window smashed and was marked with graffiti that read \'Stop specisme\'
\'Radical vegans\' hurled bricks into a butcher\'s shop window during a campaign last year
Last June, French butchers wrote to the interior ministry seeking increased protection after several businesses were vandalised across the country, often splashed with fake blood.
The pair were handed prison terms of 10 and six months over the attacks on businesses between November 2018 to February 2019.\xc2\xa0
But they are likely to escape having to serve time behind bars under French law that allows jail sentences of less than two years to be converted into community-based service.\xc2\xa0
Laurent Rigaud head of the local butchers\' federation said in a statement: \'We needed an example to be made of them so that these actions by small groups with extremist and profoundly violent ideas come to an end.\'\xc2\xa0
Two other accused, including a woman accused of complicity in the attacks, were given suspended jail terms of six months.

The court also ordered the payment of compensation to the victims, whose businesses suffered damage estimated at several million euros.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
In Lille the 3 Coqs chicken shop had its window smashed and was marked with graffiti that read \'Stop specisme\', an apparent reference to speciesism.\xc2\xa0
Hauts-de-France presiding minister Xavier Bertrand tweeted that those who who vandalise butchers are criminals, not activists, and should be prosecuted.
As eating and health habits change in traditionally carnivorous France, meat sales have been falling and the animal rights movement is increasingly active, led by campaigners including actress Brigitte Bardot.
But the CFBCT butchers\' confederation, which represents 18,000 businesses, has been fighting back, notably backing a campaign to have the culture of the butcher in France inscribed as global heritage by UNESCO.
Butchers\' shops selling a wide variety of meats and cuts are a mainstay of French shopping streets throughout the country with family-run businesses still managing to survive.\xc2\xa0
Actress Brigitte Bardot\'s animal rights movement has increased presence in the media and non-meat food options are easier to find on French restaurant menus


PARIS, April 8 (Reuters) - France had no prior warning of Libya\'s eastern commander Khalifa Haftar\'s advance on the capital Tripoli and was not trying to clandestinely undermine the country\'s peace process, a French diplomatic source said on Monday. "The immediate need in Libya is to protect the civilian population, put an end to the fighting, and get all the key Libyan players back around the table," the diplomat said.
France had "no hidden agenda," the official added. (Reporting by Marine Pennetier; writing by Richard Lough; editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta)


A switchboard operator from London who worked at the communications headquarters for the D-Day landings as a 17-year-old is being awarded France\'s highest honour.
Marie Scott, 92, will be presented with the Legion d\'honneur for her role in WWII
Marie Scott, now 92, listened to and gathered messages for Operation Overlord at Fort Southwick in Portsmouth during WWII.
Ms Scott, from New Malden in south-west London, will be presented with France\'s Legion d\'honneur for her role in the invasion to liberate western Europe from the Nazis.
As part of the 75th anniversary of D-Day in June, Ms Scott will travel with the Taxi Charity to Normandy with a group of 30 Second World War veterans.
She will be officially presented with the Legion d\'honneur by a French general at the Memorial Pegasus Museum in Normandy on June 5.
She said: \'I am truly overwhelmed to receive the Legion of Honour for the part we played in the D-Day landings.
\'Very few women have received this medal and it is a true honour.
\'Being officially presented with the medal at the Pegasus Museum on June 5 surrounded by a group of World War Two veterans will be a very moving experience.\'
The switchboard operator listened to and gathered messages for Operation Overlord at Fort Southwick in Portsmouth during WWII
The Taxi Charity for Military Veterans was formed in Fulham in 1948 and arranges trips for veterans from all conflicts.
A spokeswoman for the charity said: \'Working on the switchboard in Fort Southwick, Marie would pass messages from the continent to the leaders of Operation Overlord, General Eisenhower and Field Marshall Montgomery.
\'One of her most vivid memories is that when the beaches transmitted she could hear the gunfire.\'


LONDON (AP) - The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
10:15 a.m.
Julian Assange\'s mother has taken to Twitter to call on authorities to be gentle with her son, who\'s jailed in London after his removal from the Ecuadorian Embassy.
Christine Assange\'s tweets on Friday say Assange had been deprived of fresh air, exercise and medical care. "Please be patient, gentle & kind to him" she asked of police and court personnel.
The WikiLeaks founder is an Australia native, and the government said he would receive consular help due to its citizens after he was arrested on a U.S. conspiracy charge. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the expected battle over Assange\'s possible extradition would not involve Australia.

9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.

9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."


PARIS, April 9 (Reuters) - France must keep its economic reforms on course despite resistance from "yellow vest" protesters and slower economic growth, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said on Tuesday.
President Emmanuel Macron\'s government has faced weekly protests since mid-November over the high cost of living, taxes and perceived elitism, triggering some of the worst street violence seen in decades.
After quickly rewriting labour laws to make hiring and firing easier at the start of his five-year term in 2017, Macron has since fallen behind on his agenda of economic reforms for France, which is the euro zone\'s second-biggest economy.
Macron\'s government has made relatively little further progress on planned overhauls of unemployment insurance, the pension system and spending cuts.
"Continuing pro-growth reforms, in line with recent measures, is key to further reducing unemployment," the OECD said in a bi-annual country report on France.
"However, short-term negative impacts on some categories of the population should be compensated to ensure the social acceptability of the reform process," it added.
The French government offered a 10 billion euros ($11.3 billion) package of concessions to protesters in December, after the most violent of the "yellow vests" demonstrations, with measures designed to boost the income of the poorest workers and pensioners.
Macron has since sought to rebuild his political standing - vital to push through further reforms - with a series of national debates on policy priorities as he faces the biggest challenge to his presidency so far from the protests.
The OECD estimated that Macron\'s reforms could add 3.2 percent to per capita GDP over the next decade, benefiting mostly middle and lower-middle income households.
Even more ambitious reforms in line with OECD recommendations - such as faster spending cuts and raising the retirement age - could lift that figure to more than 5 percent, added the OECD.
The OECD forecast that France was set to grow 1.3 percent for this year and next year, partly because of the income boost expected from the government\'s concessions package.
For its part, the government is forecasting 1.4 percent growth for 2019 and 2020.

PARIS, April 2 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron urged Britain on Tuesday to come up with a plan to break the Brexit deadlock before a summit in Brussels next week, or risk slipping automatically towards a disorderly exit from the European Union.
"If the United Kingdom is not capable, almost three years after the referendum, of coming forward with a solution that is supported by a majority, it will have effectively chosen a no-deal exit on its own," Macron said.
Speaking ahead of talks with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, Macron said whether that alternative plan involved a snap election, a referendum or a customs union was for Britain to decide.
"It\'s up to London to say it, and to say it now," he said. (Reporting by Michel Rose; editing by Richard Lough)


PARIS, April 7 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron wants to declare April 7 as a national day of commemoration of the Rwandan genocide, his Elysee office said in a statement on Sunday.
The presidency made the announcement as the Rwandan government started commemorations marking the 25th anniversary of the genocide against Tutsi and moderate Hutus, raising the curtain on a three-month remembrance period.
The French president will not attend official commemorations of the massacre on Sunday. He will be represented by Herv\xc3\xa9 Berville, a Tutsi survivor of the genocide who is a member of French parliament from Macron\'s ruling party.
Rwandan President Paul Kagame has accused Paris of being complicit in the bloodshed in which Hutu militias killed around 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
While Paris has acknowledged mistakes in its dealings with Rwanda, it has repeatedly dismissed accusations that it trained militias to take part in the massacre.
The statement on Sunday did not give further details on how the anniversary would be marked in France. French high schools will start teaching the Rwandan genocide from September 2020.
Separately, Macron has appointed researchers to carry out a two-year investigation into the role of the French army in the genocide.

PARIS, April 8 (Reuters) - Brazilian soccer legend Pele was discharged from a French hospital on Monday after recovering from a urinary infection, media in France reported.
Pele, 78, was admitted to the hospital in Paris last Wednesday with a strong fever, after attending an event in the city with France\'s World Cup-winning player Kylian Mbapp.
Pele, considered by many as soccer\'s best-ever player and the winner of three World Cups with the Brazilian national team, was treated with antibiotics and said on Friday he was feeling much better.
There was no immediate confirmation of the discharge from Pele\'s press office in Brazil.

Francesco Molinari may view himself as \'no spring chicken\' but the Open champion hopes to use a few old tricks to contend for a second major title in the 83rd Masters.
Molinari\'s best finish at Augusta National was a tie for 19th in 2012 but the Italian comes into the event on the back of a stellar 12 months.
The 36-year-old has won four times since last year\'s Masters, including the Open Championship at Carnoustie, while he also became the first European player to earn a perfect 5-0 record in the Ryder Cup in Paris.
Francesco Molinari pictured in action during a practice round at Augusta ahead of the Masters
\'What has let me down in the past here is on and around the greens,\' Molinari said.
\'It\'s a very tough test because of the speed and undulations, so I hope to show the progress I\'ve made in the last few months and get a good performance in this week.
\'I can see some things now I\'ve improved in the putting that I wasn\'t doing well in the past that would be costly around here.
\'It\'s a course most guys need to play a few times to learn a few tricks. Hopefully, I can use the experience from the last few years this week.
Molinari won last year\'s Open Championship and has been in excellent form over the last year
\'There\'s been a lot of work going on in the last few years and sometimes it doesn\'t pay off straight away. It\'s taken a while, but obviously, now success is coming quite often and that\'s a nice feeling.
\'So I\'ll try to keep working to keep the success coming and win as many tournaments as I can. You know, I\'m not a spring chicken anymore, so I need to make the most of it.\'
Molinari\'s first experience of Augusta National was as a caddie for his brother in 2006 after Edoardo qualified by virtue of winning the US Amateur title the year before.
\'I carried the clubs and prayed that he was going to hit good shots,\' Molinari said of the experience.
Molinari plays a shot from the sand on Monday as he gears up for the start of the Masters
\'It was a fun week. I think I got here after missing a cut on the European Tour (in the Algarve Open de Portugal) and just got the full caddie experience.
\'It was great to be here. It wasn\'t fun trying to pick clubs for him. It\'s a tough course to caddie around.
\'You know, when you stand on the 12th tee, you just hope to make the right decision but it\'s really not easy, especially where we both were at the time.
\'We were very inexperienced at this level and just trying to make the most of those two days, to be honest.\'

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.

France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" - one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."

PARIS (AP) - The beIN Sports television network and commentator Daniel Bravo have apologized after Bravo described Strasbourg striker Nuno Da Costa\'s statistics as "not bad for a black."
Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.
Da Costa wrote: "No worries, a tongue slip happens, he works too much. beIN SPORTS, stop mid-week games please."

Around 3,000 foreign children from 43 countries are housed at the Al-Hol camp in Syria, according to the UN
France has ruled out the repatriation of French jihadists and their families detained in Syria after the fall of the Islamic State group\'s "caliphate", Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said Friday.
France and other European nations have been wrestling with how to handle the hundreds of foreign fighters, many of whom are being held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces which led the final push against IS.
French daily Liberation reported Friday that in early March the government had been ready to bring home around 250 men, women and children before abandoning the plan given public hostility to the repatriations.
The issue is extremely sensitive in France, where a deadly 2015 attack on the capital claimed by IS killed 130 people and set off a wave of other deadly assaults since then.
"It\'s logical that our services considered all hypotheses. This was one of the hypothesis they prepared," Castaner said at a press conference following a meeting of G7 interior ministers in Paris.
"No communal repatriation was under consideration to be carried out," he said, reiterating that France would nonetheless study bringing back children of jihadist fighters on a "case-by-case basis".
He denied Liberation\'s claim that France\'s policy with regards to fighters in Syria was being dictated by public opinion.
Last month, French authorities for the first time brought home five orphaned children of French jihadists\' from camps in northeast Syria.
According to the UN children\'s agency UNICEF, around 3,000 foreign children from 43 countries are housed at the Al-Hol camp in Syria alone, which has taken in most of the people fleeing IS\'s self-proclaimed "caliphate" in recent weeks.
Up to 1,700 French nationals are thought to have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight with the jihadists between 2014 and 2018, according to government figures. Around 300 are believed to have died in combat.
Kurdish officials have warned they do not have the resources to hold all the captured fighters indefinitely, and Washington is also urging its allies in the anti-IS coalition to take home their citizens.
But repatriation is a politically fraught issue, and governments fear they may not have enough evidence to convict IS members who claim they did not fight.


PARIS, April 4 (Reuters) - France will airlift 12 tonnes of humanitarian aid, including 114 pumps, to flood-hit regions in Iran, the French foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday.
Exceptionally heavy rains since March 19 have flooded some 1,900 cities and villages, killing 62 people and causing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage to Iranian agriculture, leaving aid agencies struggling to cope.
France said the first shipments would start in coming days, adding that Iranian authorities had asked for assistance. (Reporting by Geert De Clercq; editing by John Irish)

PARIS, April 9 (Reuters) - France\'s finance minister said on Tuesday it was in the interest of Europe and the United States to find a friendly solution to their long-running WTO dispute, after the United States threatened new tariffs.
The U.S. Trade Representative on Monday proposed a list of EU products ranging from large commercial aircraft to dairy products and wine on which to impose tariffs as retaliation for European aircraft subsidies.
"The interest of our two countries, the interest of the United States and the European continent and France is to reach a friendly agreement," French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told a news conference in Paris.
"When I see the situation global growth is in, I don\'t think we can afford to have a trade conflict even if only on the specific issues of the aircraft industry in the United States and Europe," he added. (Reporting by Leigh Thomas and Myriam Rivet; Editing by Richard Lough)


UNITED NATIONS (AP) - France, Germany and Britain are expressing concern that Iran\'s latest ballistic missile activity is part of a trend of developing missiles capable of delivering a nuclear weapon.
Ambassadors from the three U.N. Security Council nations said in a letter to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres circulated Tuesday that Iran\'s latest buildout and launching of ballistic missiles is having a destabilizing effect in the Middle East and increasing existing tensions.
The Western allies said Iran\'s activities are "inconsistent" with a 2015 council resolution calling on it not to undertake any action involving missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.
They pointed to Iran\'s launch of a Dousti satellite, its unveiling of a Dezful surface-to-surface ballistic missile, and its public display of a variation of the Khorramshahr ballistic missile, all in February.


Marco Verratti scored a rare goal for Paris Saint-Germain as they beat Nantes 3-0 at home to reach the French Cup final on Wednesday, with a fifth consecutive title in their sights.
The midfielder, who also found the net for Italy last week, opened the scoring for the Cup holders in the first half with his first PSG goal of the season.
Kylian Mbappe scored a penalty and Daniel Alves found the net with a delicate lob to wrap up victory in the closing stages.

Mbappe was denied from the spot by Nantes keeper Ciprian Tatarusanu earlier in the match before the visitors were reduced to 10 men after Kalifa Coulibaly was sent off for a second yellow card in the 71st minute.
PSG, who lost Marquinhos to a muscle injury, will face Stade Rennais, who beat Olympique Lyonnais 3-2 on Tuesday, in the April 27 showdown at the Stade de France.
The Ligue 1 leaders have not conceded a single goal on their way to the final.
With Neymar watching from the stands, Verratti unleashed a low diagonal shot from outside the box on 29 minutes to put the home side ahead.
It was his second goal in eight days after he scored in Italy\'s 6-0 victory over Liechtenstein in a Euro 2020 qualifier last Tuesday.
Mbappe beat Tatarusanu from the penalty spot after a Nicolas Pallois handball, but referee Francois Letexier had it retaken due to players encroaching into the box.
Tatarusanu blocked the second attempt, but he was powerless with Mbappe\'s penalty in the 83rd minute after Alves was brought down by Diego Carlos.
Alves wrapped up an emphatic win when he lobbed Tatarusanu from the edge of the box two minutes into added time.
The sides will meet again at the Parc des Princes in Ligue 1 in two weeks.


Three of rugby\'s great institutions have found themselves in a real muddle over their recruitment of a head coach.
England, France and Leicester Tigers are all suffering from a lack of clarity around who is currently coaching them, and who will be next year.
The common theme is people at the top not being qualified or accountable to make the most important decision: picking the man with the responsibility for the success or failure of their team.
The process for replacing England coach Eddie Jones has become unnecessarily messy
Let\'s start with England, who seem in yet another mess over who will take the head coach job after the World Cup.
After the 2015 World Cup, Twickenham identified Eddie Jones following his Japan side\'s wonderful win over South Africa, and they successfully prised him from the Stormers.
It has been an extraordinary ride ever since and England have every chance of being successful some four years later. That said, on the eve of the World Cup, we have public commentary from stand-in chief executive Nigel Melville about how the RFU will replace Jones if things do not go to plan.
If I were Jones I\'d go ballistic. They should back him before they review his position after the World Cup.
Rugby is becoming very short-term focused at the moment. All this talk of Warren Gatland taking the England job - what if Wales lose to Australia at the World Cup? Suddenly he isn\'t a superstar coach, it\'s as fickle as that.
RFU chief executive Nigel Melville wants to lead the search for Jones\' successor as coach
The RFU don\'t have a stellar track record in hiring or firing coaches. Andy Robinson, Brian Ashton, Martin Johnson and Stuart Lancaster were all installed with no real co-ordinated process. There is a much bigger picture that you must look at when appointing the coach, which the RFU don\'t seem to grasp because no one is remotely qualified to make these decisions.
Rob Andrew appointed Johnson, Ian Ritchie appointed Lancaster and Jones and it seems Melville wants to lead on the decision on the next coach, despite having zero qualifications to make this appointment.\xc2\xa0
Incoming Bill Sweeney may not arrive from the British Olympic Association until the World Cup \xe2\x80\x94 he should be completely involved when he starts. My advice to them all is calm down, reflect on what happens in Japan, there is no rush.
There seems to be a total lack of responsibility among these guys. They have to be accountable. If they won\'t take any responsibility then they should not be involved.
Geordan Murphy was parachuted in by Leicester but does not have the experience to be a No 1
Leicester have similar problems. Who will put their hand up and say they made the decision to hire and fire Richard Cockerill, Aaron Mauger and Geordan Murphy?
Like the RFU, what qualifications do those involved actually have to appoint a coach? I am a former Leicester player, former board member and a fan \xe2\x80\x94 I would love to know who is making these coaching decisions, and why.
Tigers are in a hole and have brought in Mike Ford, who is an excellent coach, but it feels like they are clutching at straws. It\'s an incredibly tough ask for him to turn everything round \xe2\x80\x94 shown by their 52-20 defeat by Exeter. He is not the head coach.
That is Murphy, who was parachuted in when the Tigers sacked Matt O\'Connor after one game of the season, a big call. He has never had the full responsibility of being in sole charge of a team of this magnitude.\xc2\xa0
The difference in skills between being an assistant and the main man is vast. Murphy is a good coach, but does not have the experience to be a No 1 \xe2\x80\x94 he was not even given a pre-season to embed ideas.
Parachuting coaches in exposes them horribly. Of course they\'ll take the job if it\'s the opportunity of a lifetime, but when it doesn\'t work out the people who put them in this position get off scot free.
Leicester have one of the best back lines I have seen on paper, but they could well go down, which could be a disaster for England.
There is debate over whether a foreign coach should replace France boss Jacques Brunel
France are in a similar mess. The FFR have said they are going to hold a referendum among all their clubs to ask whether there would be support for a foreign coach to replace incumbent Jacques Brunel. The answer to their problems is staring them in the face.
I watched the Racing 92 v Toulouse Champions Cup quarter-final last weekend and saw two sets of great young coaches putting together two exceptional sides who contributed to a great spectacle.
Racing have a coaching duo of Laurent Travers and Laurent Labit, and Toulouse have Ugo Mola. The teams put on a display I have not seen from any English club for a long time. It was a class above the Premiership.
All those coaches are backs too, who I\'ve always thought make the best top men. Travers, Labit and Mola have good records and have earned the right to coach those teams.
France are not short of top coaches \xe2\x80\x94 they don\'t necessarily need a top international big-hitter, just someone who understands the differences between the club and Test games.
The one nation that does this well is New Zealand. It is like a business, and former players, like Sean Fitzpatrick, regard themselves as passionate shareholders in the All Blacks. They will not allow a bad decision to be made.
It\'s not one man\'s whim, it\'s a thorough process. This is how top businesses treat recruitment. If you were a shareholder of England, Leicester or France you wouldn\'t accept the decision process. Still in rugby there are too many examples of the game living in the amateur era.


WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - The governments of France, Italy, the United Arab Emirates, Britain and the United States said on Thursday they were deeply concerned about fighting around the Libyan town of Gharyan and urged all sides to immediately de-escalate tensions.
"At this sensitive moment in Libya\'s transition, military posturing and threats of unilateral action only risk propelling Libya back toward chaos," they said in a joint statement released in Washington by the State Department. "We strongly believe that there is no military solution to the Libya conflict." (Reporting by Tim Ahmann Editing by Tom Brown )


French health officials have officially banned two types of breast implants because of fears they can cause cancer.
Surgeons in the country will no longer be allowed to use implants with a textured or polyurethane-coated surface.
The country\'s National Agency of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) made the announcement today, reporting that 59 cases of implant-caused cancer have been confirmed since 2011.
It said there is a \'rare but serious danger\' of women developing anaplastic large cell lymphoma as a result of their implants.
The move follows a de facto ban by the French last year when they refused to renew the safety approval of certain implants made by the company Allergan.
France\'s\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0National Agency of Medicines and Health Products today banned textured and polyurethane-coated breast implants amid fears they cause cancer (stock image)
Health chiefs are growing increasingly concerned about a link between implants and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL).
The illness is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and occurs when white blood cells turn cancerous and build up in the lymph nodes \xe2\x80\x93 immune system reservoirs.
French news publication Le Monde, which published a leaked letter the ANSM sent to implant manufacturers, called the decision \'historic\'.\xc2\xa0
The ANSM reportedly told the companies BIA-ALCL has a \'rare cancer pathology, but [is] likely to lead to the death of patients\'.
The government organisation has been tracking people with the breast implants since 2011, when concerns about the link to cancer were first raised.\xc2\xa0
And among those who developed BIA-ALCL, the ANSM said women with textured implants were \'over-represented\'.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Around 400,000 women in France are believed to have breast implants, but the ANSM today said there was no need for them to have them removed in light of the ban.
It described the move as \'precautionary\' and it will result in the implants concerned being removed from the French market.
In its statement the ANSM said: \'Given the rarity of the risk of occurrence of [cancer], the ANSM does not recommend preventive explantation of macrotextured implants and implants with polyurethane-coated surface.\'
WHAT IS BIA-ALCL?\xc2\xa0 BIA-ALCL is breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma. It is a rare but treatable cancer that develops around breast implants. The US Food and Drug administration has had reports of 457 patients developing the disease. Per its latest statistics, the UK\'s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has recorded 48 cases of BIA-ALCL since 2011. The cancer most commonly occurs among women who have had breast implants with a textured surface. The disease is a type of T-cell lymphoma, which means it affects lymphocytes, more commonly known as white blood cells. These can start a cancer when one mutates to become abnormal or out of control, then divides into more cancerous cells which spread.\xc2\xa0 BIA-ALCL is a relatively treatable cancer and many patients are declared cancer-free after having the implants and surrounding tissue removed.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The survival rate for patients with BIA-ALCL is 89 per cent for five years after being declared cancer-free.\xc2\xa0
The organisation also said it wanted to drive home the importance of giving women \'rigorous and complete\' information before they have implants, and said surgeons must have frank discussions about the risks of the procedure.
It is unclear how many of the women who developed cancer had textured implants but, in the UK, as many as 99 per cent of women with implants have textured ones.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
France refused to renew approval for some textured implants last year, effectively banning them in the country and EU.
This affected the Allergan Natrelle implants with Biocell and Microcell textured surfaces.
At the time the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons also urged medics in the UK to stop using them.\xc2\xa0
And concerns go back even further \xe2\x80\x93 in July 2017 Professor Jim Frame, a cosmetic surgery expert at Anglia Ruskin University said: \'This cancer is a potential bombshell that has been swept under the carpet for five years.
\'Textured implants should be banned. We should return to using smooth ones which were safe.\'\xc2\xa0
France was also at the centre of the major PIP scandal in 2010 which involved implants filled with a cheap industrial-grade silicone gel.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Poly Implant Proth\xc3\xa8se, a company based in the southern town of\xc2\xa0La Seyne-sur-Mer was shut down and its founder Jean-Claude Mas was sentenced to four years in prison for fraud.
PIP implants had been found to be made of silicone intended for mattresses, not for medical use, and were two to six times more likely to burst than regular implants.\xc2\xa0
A ruptured implant could cause lumpiness or swelling, redness, pain and a burning sensation, but there have been no proven long-term effects.
In a March 2017 report, the US Food and Drug Administration found women with breast implants had a \'very low but increased risk\' of developing anaplastic large-cell lymphoma compared with women who did not have them.
Of the 359 cases of BIA-ALCL reported in the US, 203 were found in wearers of textured implants compared with 28 in wearers of smooth implants, the report said.
The UK\'s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has recorded 48 cases of BIA-ALCL since it started recording in 2011.
It has not banned the implants from being used but the issue remains controversial, and the MHRA urges surgeons to explain the risks to women considering having them.
The ANSM\'s ban will take effect from tomorrow, Friday April 5.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0


The Democratic Unionists have branded Theresa May\xe2\x80\x99s bid for a Brexit extension as humiliating and embarrassing.
Party leader Arlene Foster and Westminster leader Nigel Dodds both accused Mrs May of \xe2\x80\x9cbegging\xe2\x80\x9d European leaders for help to break the impasse.
The senior figures in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s confidence and supply partners did not hold back in their criticism of the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s handling of the process as she spent the day holding talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe talks between the Prime Minister and the leaders of France and Germany is humiliating and embarrassing for the United Kingdom,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Dodds said on Tuesday evening.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe problems the Prime Minister is attempting to solve were not created by the decision to leave the European Union, rather the ineffective negotiations by the Prime Minister to implement that decision.
\xe2\x80\x9cA solution was put forward by the House of Commons on 29th January through the Brady amendment which could have charted a course by which Parliament could have supported a deal.
\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of treating this proposal seriously, the Prime Minister has effectively accepted the backstop and opted not to stand up to Brussels.
\xe2\x80\x9cNearly three years after the referendum the UK is today effectively holding out a begging bowl to European leaders.\xe2\x80\x9d

Earlier, Mrs Foster questioned Mrs May\xe2\x80\x99s leadership qualities.
\xe2\x80\x9cShe needed to be strong, she needed to show leadership, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been evident in these past couple of months,\xe2\x80\x9d she told the BBC.
Mrs Foster said the Prime Minister had found herself \xe2\x80\x9cpleading\xe2\x80\x9d to stay in the EU to resolve issues that should have been already settled.
\xe2\x80\x9cI find it quite painful to watch what\xe2\x80\x99s going on at this present moment in time, it is rather humiliating that we are having to go and beg so that we can leave,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.


A trade union boss has been accused of hypocrisy after it emerged her female staff earn less than their male colleagues.
Frances O\'Grady called for big employers to do more after figures released last week showed nearly half of all major British companies failed to reduce their gender pay gap over the last year.
But figures show a gap exists within the TUC\'s own employees, with women at the organisation now earning 94p for every \xc2\xa31 earned by a man.
Two years ago there was no gap at the union between what women and men were paid, according to figures from the\xc2\xa0Gender Pay Gap Service.
O\xe2\x80\x99Grady, who is the TUC general secretary, saw her pay grow last year by \xc2\xa318,000 - bringing her total package to \xc2\xa3175,000 a year.\xc2\xa0
TUC general secretary Frances O\'Grady told big employers to do more to tackle their gender pay gaps. She is pictured speaking at a trade union press conference on Brexit
She recently criticised firms that did not tackle the their own gender pay gaps and called bosses who did not take action to be fined.
Earlier this week she said: \'Big employers clearly aren\'t doing enough to tackle the root causes of pay inequality and working women are paying the price.
\'Government needs to crank up the pressure. Companies shouldn\'t just be made to publish their gender pay gaps; they should be legally required to explain how they\'ll close them, and bosses who flout the law should be fined.\'\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
New figures published last week showed nearly half of all major British companies have failed to reduce their gender pay gap over the last year.
Of the organisations which met last week\'s deadline for reporting gender pay figures, 78 per cent have shown a gap in favour of men - despite Theresa May vowing last year to tackle the \'burning injustice\' of unequal pay.
The gap actually became bigger in 45 per cent of companies - mainly due to men\'s earnings rising faster than women\'s.
A TUC spokesman said that the shift in the union\'s pay gap was down to it being a small organisation that had seen recent changes to staff members.\xc2\xa0
He said: \'We keep a careful eye on our pay gap data, which we publish voluntarily.\xc2\xa0

\'As a small organisation, a few staffing changes can have a big impact on our headline figures.\xc2\xa0
\'We have put robust measures in place to ensure a low pay gap including transparent pay structures and generous childcare policies, and we\'ll continue to monitor and update our action plan.\'
Other unions also have wide gender pay gaps, including Unite the Union, where women earn 28 per cent less than their male counterparts.\xc2\xa0
Public sector union, Unison, which is the largest in the UK, sees female employees earn\xc2\xa085p for every \xc2\xa31 a male worker earned, according to the figures.
Nearly half of all major British companies failed to reduce their gender pay gap over the last year, the figures revealed.\xc2\xa0
Employers whose gender pay gap increased in size year-on-year also include Huddersfield Town FC, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Dyfed-Powys Police, Ryanair and Kwik Fit.\xc2\xa0


US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will skip a meeting of Group of Seven foreign ministers in France
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will skip a meeting of Group of Seven ministers this week in France, the State Department said Tuesday, amid persistent tensions between Europe and President Donald Trump.
Officials did not explain Pompeo\'s absence. But the move comes amid a long list of disagreements, including the US rejection of international agreements on ending Iran\'s nuclear program and fighting climate change.
The State Department said that Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan would represent the United States and be joined by David Hale, the top-ranking US career diplomat, at the talks Friday and Saturday in Dinard on the coast of Brittany.
Sullivan "will engage in discussions on a broad range of issues, including the deteriorating situation in Venezuela, destabilizing Iranian behavior in the Middle East, the responsible conduct of states in cyber space and the final denuclearization of North Korea," a State Department statement said.
Asked to explain Pompeo\'s absence, State Department spokesman Robert Palladino gave no specific reason but said: "Trans-Atlantic alliances are stronger than ever."
Pompeo has "full faith" in Sullivan "and his ability to advance America\'s national security interests," Palladino said.
Pompeo will already be seeing several of his G7 counterparts Wednesday and Thursday in Washington at a 70th anniversary gathering of the NATO alliance, but he has no announced conflicting engagements later in the week.
The Group of Seven is the longstanding club of major industrialized democracies, with their summits often steering the global agenda.
Besides the United States and France, the group includes Britain, Canada, Germany, Italy and Japan.
French President Emmanuel Macron is hoping to push an ambitious agenda at the G7 summit in August in the resort of Biarritz, for which the foreign ministers meeting is meant to prepare.
The French hosts are no doubt mindful of lessons from the last G7 in Canada, where Trump refused to sign the final communique and openly criticized his host, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, over trade policies.


PARIS, April 10 (Reuters) - An escalation in the subsidy row involving European planemaker Airbus and U.S. rival Boeing would be senseless and serve only to benefit an emerging Chinese competitor, France\'s finance minister said on Wednesday.
President Donald Trump\'s threat this week to impose tariffs on $11 billion worth of European Union products, including commercial aircraft, has deepened a long-running trans-Atlantic subsidy dispute.
The United States and Europe have been locked in a years-long spat over mutual claims of illegal aid to Airbus and Boeing to help them gain advantage in the world jet business.
"A clash between Boeing and Airbus would be absurd simply because our two industries are totally intertwined, we depend on each other for a number of components," Bruno Le Maire said in remarks at the French Institute of Foreign Relations.
"A commercial war between Boeing and Airbus will only play into the hands of COMAC," he added, referring to Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd.
COMAC is leading China\'s push to become a global civil aerospace player. In November the company and Russia\'s United Aircraft Corp unveiled a life-sized model of a proposed widebody longhaul jet, and in December COMAC\'S C919 narrowbody passenger jet completed its first test flight.
Le Maire said Europe had the means to retaliate to any U.S. sanctions on EU goods, but added: "It is infinitely preferable that together with our U.S. allies we find the path towards a compromise." (Reporting by Yann Le Guernigou Writing by Richard Lough Editing by David Holmes)


An unaccompanied migrant claiming to be 16 years old so he could claim asylum in France has been exposed as a 47-year-old man.
The man had presented himself to police in the town of Angouleme, around 70 miles north of Bordeaux, on Wednesday last week.
In order to back up his claim, he presented officers with a birth certificate which purported to show he was born in Guinea in 2002.\xc2\xa0
A man claiming to be a 16-year-old from guinea presented himself to this police station in France, before being exposed as a 47-year-old
But investigators made contact with Spanish authorities, suspecting that he may have arrived in that country first before crossing into France, Sud-Oest reports.
Officers in Spain confirmed they were aware of the man\'s identity and presented their French counterparts with a copy of his passport that he had used to apply for a visa there in 2017.
The passport confirmed the man was 47 years old, more than three decades older than he had claimed.
French police rejected his asylum claim, ordered him to leave the prefecture and placed him in a detention center in Rennes.
The previous day another migrant, claiming to be a 16-year-old from Mali, had approached the same police station.
The incident happened in the town of Angouleme, where just a day before another man had appeared claiming to be a 16-year-old from Mali when in fact he was 21
A similar check with Spanish authorities revealed he was, in fact, 21.
Under French law, the state has a responsibility to care for all unaccompanied minor migrants, whether they have applied for asylum or not, until they turn 18.
In order to claim accommodation and schooling, minors must apply to the\xc2\xa0child social assistance service which will assess their age and whether they are genuinely unaccompanied.\xc2\xa0
If a minor wishes to stay in France after they turn 18, they must then apply for asylum which will be dealt with by a different agency.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0


BRUSSELS (AP) - French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.
"The key for us is to remain grouped together," Macron said. "We have a European renaissance to lead. We don\'t want the Brexit problem to block us on this point."
In the end, the EU leaders hammered out a compromise - giving May more time than Macron wanted to give her to steer a departure deal through her country\'s bitterly divided parliament, while simultaneously shaving months off Tusk\'s suggestion.
As Wednesday night ebbed into the wee hours of Thursday, Macron stood his ground, insisting on a shorter delay than Tusk and most other EU nations wanted. May had requested pushing the Brexit deadline back to June 30, but did not object to a longer delay.

Leaders ultimately coalesced around Oct. 31 - Halloween - as the latest Brexit deadline, averting a potentially disruptive no-deal British departure that would have happened Friday if no extension had been agreed.
"We had a very intensive debate," was how German Chancellor Angela Merkel characterized the summit.
Hanging tough in Brussels could also pay domestic political dividends for Macron, projecting strength at a time when he is weakened by yellow vest protesters at home.
"There seem to be those who think it is good politics for Macron at home to stand up to the British," said Anand Menon, professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at Kings College London and Director of the UK in a Changing Europe Initiative. "One of the things that certainly seems to have happened is that he annoyed a lot of people in Brussels last night by what many saw as his unnecessary theatrics."
A senior EU official at the talks acknowledged that it was "a difficult moment" but said the atmosphere remained constructive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the talks.
While May now has until Oct. 31 to find backing for her unloved Brexit withdrawal deal, Britain could still leave earlier if talks with the country\'s opposition Labour Party find a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament.
"I continue to believe we need to leave the EU, with a deal, as soon as possible," May told reporters.
Manfred Weber, a German who leads the biggest group in the European Parliament, said Europe showed "patience and unity" in avoiding a damaging no-deal Brexit. But he added that "the political uncertainty in London has been extended, which risks affecting debates about the future of Europe."
Germany\'s Spiegel Online called the early-morning agreement a "classic Brussels compromise."
"The EU retained its unity on Brexit - albeit only just," it said.
The British press compared the latest Brexit machinations to Wednesday\'s other big news - the publication of the first-ever photograph of a black hole.
"Here\'s another inescapable black hole," The Times wrote under the photo, referencing Britain\'s Brexit impasse.

PARIS, April 3 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May\'s desire for a Brexit compromise with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn is positive but offers no guarantee of a way out of the crisis, France\'s new European Affairs Minister Amelie de Montchalin said on Wednesday.
"Theresa May\'s call yesterday evening for national unity is very positive, but we have no certainty on what will be the outcome," the junior minister, appointed this week, told lawmakers.
If Theresa May failed to come forward with a clear plan to break the deadlock, then Britain would have effectively opted to quit the European Union without a deal, she added. (Reporting by Richard Lough; editing by Michel Rose)


PARIS, France, April 11 (Reuters) - France will vote against the opening of trade negotiations between the European Union and United States given the repeated trade threats from Washington and its decision to quit the Paris climate accord, an Elysee official said on Thursday.
"France does not want a trade war or tension with the United States", the source said, adding that it was likely only France would oppose opening the talks.
The French move does not block opening of the trade negotiations because the necessary majority of EU member states backs it. (Reporting by Jean-Baptsite Vey; Writing by John Irish; Editing by Hugh Lawson)


PARIS (AP) - The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.

The Democratic Unionists have branded Theresa May\xe2\x80\x99s bid for a Brexit extension as humiliating and embarrassing.
Party leader Arlene Foster and Westminster leader Nigel Dodds both accused Mrs May of \xe2\x80\x9cbegging\xe2\x80\x9d European leaders for help to break the impasse.
The senior figures in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s confidence and supply partners did not hold back in their criticism of the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s handling of the process as she spent the day holding talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe talks between the Prime Minister and the leaders of France and Germany is humiliating and embarrassing for the United Kingdom,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Dodds said on Tuesday evening.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe problems the Prime Minister is attempting to solve were not created by the decision to leave the European Union, rather the ineffective negotiations by the Prime Minister to implement that decision.
\xe2\x80\x9cA solution was put forward by the House of Commons on 29th January through the Brady amendment which could have charted a course by which Parliament could have supported a deal.
\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of treating this proposal seriously, the Prime Minister has effectively accepted the backstop and opted not to stand up to Brussels.
\xe2\x80\x9cNearly three years after the referendum the UK is today effectively holding out a begging bowl to European leaders.\xe2\x80\x9d

Earlier, Mrs Foster questioned Mrs May\xe2\x80\x99s leadership qualities.
\xe2\x80\x9cShe needed to be strong, she needed to show leadership, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been evident in these past couple of months,\xe2\x80\x9d she told the BBC.
Mrs Foster said the Prime Minister had found herself \xe2\x80\x9cpleading\xe2\x80\x9d to stay in the EU to resolve issues that should have been already settled.
\xe2\x80\x9cI find it quite painful to watch what\xe2\x80\x99s going on at this present moment in time, it is rather humiliating that we are having to go and beg so that we can leave,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.


PARIS (AP) - Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties - as well as others on Europe\'s right - could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.

Two vegan activists have been jailed for a string of attacks on butchers and restaurants in France that caused millions of euros in damage.\xc2\xa0
In what was described as the first case of its kind in the country, the pair were handed prison sentences for criminal damage to shops, butchers and eateries.\xc2\xa0
The\xc2\xa0\'anti-speciesist\' couple, a 23-year-old youth worker named Cyrile and a 29-year-old employee at a kindergarten called Mathilde, were convicted of criminal damage after breaking windows and starting fires at butchers, fishmongers, restaurants and shops around the Lille area of northern France.
During the trial, Cyrile and Mathilde, who both had no previous criminal record, admitted taking part in nocturnal raids where they broke windows or scrawled slogans like \'Stop Speciesism\' and \'Assassins\' on businesses selling meat.
The activists are from a movement that describes itself as being \'anti-speciesist\', which rejects the idea of humans sitting at the top of the species hierarchy and consuming animals.\xc2\xa0
The 3 Coqs chicken shop in Lille, northern France, had its window smashed and was marked with graffiti that read \'Stop specisme\'
\'Radical vegans\' hurled bricks into a butcher\'s shop window during a campaign last year
Last June, French butchers wrote to the interior ministry seeking increased protection after several businesses were vandalised across the country, often splashed with fake blood.
The pair were handed prison terms of 10 and six months over the attacks on businesses between November 2018 to February 2019.\xc2\xa0
But they are likely to escape having to serve time behind bars under French law that allows jail sentences of less than two years to be converted into community-based service.\xc2\xa0
Laurent Rigaud head of the local butchers\' federation said in a statement: \'We needed an example to be made of them so that these actions by small groups with extremist and profoundly violent ideas come to an end.\'\xc2\xa0
Two other accused, including a woman accused of complicity in the attacks, were given suspended jail terms of six months.
Butchers in France warn of \'vegan violence\' after shops were attacked by hard-line campaigners last June
The court also ordered the payment of compensation to the victims, whose businesses suffered damage estimated at several million euros.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
In Lille the 3 Coqs chicken shop had its window smashed and was marked with graffiti that read \'Stop specisme\', an apparent reference to speciesism.\xc2\xa0
Hauts-de-France presiding minister Xavier Bertrand tweeted that those who who vandalise butchers are criminals, not activists, and should be prosecuted.
As eating and health habits change in traditionally carnivorous France, meat sales have been falling and the animal rights movement is increasingly active, led by campaigners including actress Brigitte Bardot.
But the CFBCT butchers\' confederation, which represents 18,000 businesses, has been fighting back, notably backing a campaign to have the culture of the butcher in France inscribed as global heritage by UNESCO.
Butchers\' shops selling a wide variety of meats and cuts are a mainstay of French shopping streets throughout the country with family-run businesses still managing to survive.\xc2\xa0
Actress Brigitte Bardot\'s animal rights movement has increased presence in the media and non-meat food options are easier to find on French restaurant menus


BRUSSELS, April 11 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday he took responsibility for blocking a long Brexit delay and convincing other European Union leaders to agree to a shorter one in order to preserve the functioning of the EU.
"It\'s true that the majority was more in favour of a very long extension. But it was not logical in my view, and above all, it was neither good for us, nor for the UK," he said.
"I take responsibility for this position, I think it\'s for the collective good," the French leader added before leaving the European Council in Brussels. (Reporting by Michel Rose; editing by Bart Meijer)


A switchboard operator from London who worked at the communications headquarters for the D-Day landings as a 17-year-old is being awarded France\'s highest honour.
Marie Scott, 92, will be presented with the Legion d\'honneur for her role in WWII
Marie Scott, now 92, listened to and gathered messages for Operation Overlord at Fort Southwick in Portsmouth during WWII.
Ms Scott, from New Malden in south-west London, will be presented with France\'s Legion d\'honneur for her role in the invasion to liberate western Europe from the Nazis.
As part of the 75th anniversary of D-Day in June, Ms Scott will travel with the Taxi Charity to Normandy with a group of 30 Second World War veterans.
She will be officially presented with the Legion d\'honneur by a French general at the Memorial Pegasus Museum in Normandy on June 5.
She said: \'I am truly overwhelmed to receive the Legion of Honour for the part we played in the D-Day landings.
\'Very few women have received this medal and it is a true honour.
\'Being officially presented with the medal at the Pegasus Museum on June 5 surrounded by a group of World War Two veterans will be a very moving experience.\'
The switchboard operator listened to and gathered messages for Operation Overlord at Fort Southwick in Portsmouth during WWII
The Taxi Charity for Military Veterans was formed in Fulham in 1948 and arranges trips for veterans from all conflicts.
A spokeswoman for the charity said: \'Working on the switchboard in Fort Southwick, Marie would pass messages from the continent to the leaders of Operation Overlord, General Eisenhower and Field Marshall Montgomery.
\'One of her most vivid memories is that when the beaches transmitted she could hear the gunfire.\'


SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.

France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" - one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."

PARIS, April 1 (Reuters) - French bank Societe Generale has appointed Gianluca Soma as new group country head for Russia, the company said on Monday.
Soma, who will take on the new job on July 1st, will replace Didier Hauguel, who is leaving the post.
Soma will keep his responsibility as SocGen\'s Head of International Banking Networks for Europe, while Hauguel will keep non-executive functions at some of SocGen\'s units in Russia, Germany and in France.
During its most recent strategy update in November 2017, SocGen has identified the Russian market as a growth area. Its Russian bank, Rosbank, has reported "profitable growth" in 2018, the French bank said. (Reporting by Inti Landauro; Editing by Bate Felix)


France has been driving hard for a new so-called "GAFA tax" -- named after Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon -- to ensure the global giants pay a fair share of taxes on their massive business operations in Europe
France will stick to plans for a tax on digital giants such as Facebook and Apple, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Friday, despite angry opposition from Washington.
Last month, France unveiled draft legislation to set a three percent tax on digital advertising, the sale of personal data and other revenue for any technology company that earns more than 750 million euros ($841 million) worldwide each year.
The effort comes amid rising public outrage at the minimal tax paid by some of the world\'s richest firms which base operations in jurisdictions that charge low rates.
"We are determined to implement a tax on the largest digital companies to bring more justice and efficiency to the international tax system," Le Maire said as he arrived in Bucharest for talks with his eurozone counterparts.
"All states take their own free and sovereign decisions on tax matters," Le Maire added.
France drafted the law after a European Union-wide effort it championed was scuttled by low-tax countries such as Ireland, where big technology firms have set up their EU headquarters.
Other countries are considering following France\'s lead including Britain, Spain, Austria and Italy.
- US opposition -
Le Maire spoke just hours after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo raised his objections to the tax as he met French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian in Washington.
Pompeo said the tax would hurt US companies "and the French citizens who use them," according to the State Department.
The US has opened several fronts against the tax, announcing in March that Washington was considering a complaint to the World Trade Organisation that the levy was discriminatory.
Big tech\'s lobby in Brussels also assailed the tax in an email to AFP.
"Instead of adopting a discriminatory national digital tax, which conflicts with EU state aid rules and upsets trade relations, France should lead efforts for a more ambitious, global tax reform," the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) said.
France\'s Le Maire insisted that Paris was also in favour of a global solution and would work closely with the US to draw up a tax reform at the OECD, the organisation of advanced economies, including China.
This was the "better solution", Le Maire said, adding that he would hold talks with his US counterpart Steven Mnuchin next month to accelerate this process.
"I hope that by 2020 we can reach an agreement within the OECD," Le Maire said.


Another football race row erupted in France on Wednesday evening when a TV pundit described a goal as being \'not bad for a black guy\'.
Former France international Daniel Bravo was working for beIN Sports when he made the controversial remark about Nuno Da Costa\'s strike against Reims.
His words sparked outrage among viewers just 24 hours after Juventus striker Moise Kean was subjected to vile racist taunts during his side\'s win at Cagliari.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0

Da Costa scored twice for Strasbourg on Wednesday, including this penalty to make it 4-0
Bravo, who made 13 appearances for France and played for likes of PSG, Monaco and Nice as a midfielder, went to find Da Costa after the final whistle.
He said sorry for his comment, which came after Da Costa had opened the scoring in Strasbourg\'s 4-0 victory at the Meinau Stadium.
The 28-year-old was quick to accept Bravo\'s apology and immediately took to Twitter to share a photo of himself shaking hands with the commentator.
Alongside the image, Da Costa wrote: \'No worries, a slip of the tongue happens, he works too much! @beinsports_EN stop the games in the middle of the week please.\'\xc2\xa0
Bravo, pictured playing for Monaco in 1983, earned 13 caps for France and also played for PSG

beIN SPORTS also issued an apology. In a statement they said: \'beIN SPORTS and its consultant apologise for the remarks made during the Strasbourg-Reims match, which can be considered shocking and are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial staff.
\'beIN SPORTS recalls that it fights against all forms of discrimination, in particular racism, and promotes diversity, equality and respect through all its broadcasts.\'
The incident came just a day after Leonardo Bonucci controversially claimed that his Juventus team-mate Kean was partly to blame for the racist abuse he suffered on Tuesday night.\xc2\xa0

PARIS (AP) - The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.

PARIS, April 5 (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron has appointed researchers to carry out a two-year investigation into the role of the French army in the Rwandan genocide that is still a source of tension between Paris and Kigali 25 years later.
The nine-member commission will have access to presidential, diplomatic, military and intelligence archives, the French presidency said on Friday, after Macron met members of an association supporting survivors of the genocide.
"The goal is to deliver a report which will be published in two years time ... and will be accessible to all. It will scientifically evaluate, on the basis of archives, the role that France played in Rwanda from 1990 to 1994," the presidency said.
Macron\'s predecessor Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande declassified presidential archives on the subject in 2015, but researchers have complained that only a fraction of the classified documents have surfaced and say a conclusive account on the role played by France is yet to be produced.
Rwandan President Paul Kagame has accused Paris of being complicit in the bloodshed in which Hutu militias killed around 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
While Paris has acknowledged mistakes in its dealings with Rwanda, it has repeatedly dismissed accusations that it trained militias to take part in the massacre.
However, during a visit to Rwanda in 2010, then president Nicolas Sarkozy, did acknowledge France made "a serious error of judgment, a sort of blindness when we didn\xc2\xb4t foresee the genocidal dimensions of the government".
The two countries broke off diplomatic ties in 2006 after a Paris judge accused Kagame and nine aides of shooting down former president Juvenal Habyarimana\xc2\xb4s plane in April 1994 - the catalyst for the massacre. Rwanda rejected the charges.
During that 2010 trip, Sarkozy also said a French rescue mission in under a U.N. mandate to provide safe zones, had been too little and too late. The killing started in April 1994, and the French arrived in June.
The two countries eventually restored diplomatic ties in November 2009, but Rwanda has long called on Paris to pursue genocide fugitives living on French soil.
The presidential statement said the French court dealing with Rwandan genocide cases would receive additional resources to speed up the judicial process.
The announcement of commission comes against the backdrop of commemorations marking 25 years since the genocide.
The French president will not attend official commemorations of the massacre on Sunday. He will be represented by Herv\xc3\xa9 Berville, a Tutsi survivor of the genocide who is a member of French parliament from Macron\'s ruling party.

The tug of war between Australia and France for the loyalty of Sasha Zhoya is set to go to the next level with the multi-skilled teen sensation producing a swag of remarkable displays at the national athletics championships.
Zhoya won his third gold medal on Friday, clocking a 16-year-old world best to win the under-18 110m hurdles in 13.05 seconds.
Earlier in the meet, he was just as dominant in winning the under-20 200m and pole vault, with his best vault clearance of 5.65m only seven centimetres shy of the qualifying standard for the world championships.
Zhoya was born in Perth, has lived his whole life in Australia and considers himself an Australian.
But his mother is from France, French was the first language he learnt as a toddler and the French athletics federation can dangle the tantalising prospect of a home Olympics in Paris in 2024.
"They\'re both offering some amazing things," said Zhoya.
"I want to keep a clear head and leave that decision until later in the year.
"I wish I had something more (to say) because it would make my life easier as well.
"Right now it\'s stressful; I\'m trying to put it in the back of my mind and not think about it during comps.
"But it\'s definitely popping into my head every 30 seconds."
Zhoya has to decide by December which country he will represent at the 2020 world junior championships - and potentially the Tokyo Olympics.
His other big decision is which event he will end up specialising in.
"I\'ve got absolutely zero clue at the moment," said Zhoya.
"It depends how my body progresses and how I progress.
"Anything can happen - injury could cut out one event so I want to keep the three events for the time being."
Having cut a swathe through the junior events at the nationals at Sydney Olympic Park, Zhoya switched his attention to the open-age events.
He eased into the 100m semis on Friday night in 10.66 and then went straight to the men\'s pole vault qualifying round.
ACT runner Edward Nketia was the fastest 100m heat winner in 10.39, with big guns Rohan Browning, Jack Hale and Trae Williams all keeping their powder dry while advancing to the semis on Saturday.
Maddie Coates topped the qualifiers in the opening round of the women\'s 100m in 11.75, with Riley Day fifth quickest in 11.89.


Japan\'s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will vist the US, Canada and France ahead of the G20 summit scheduled for Osaka at the end of June
Japan\'s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced Monday plans to visit the United States, Canada and France this month before his country hosts the G20 later this year.
The tour from April 22 to 29 will also include stops in Italy, Belgium and Slovakia, a foreign ministry official said.
The trip comes ahead of long-awaited trade talks between Washington and Tokyo, as US President Donald Trump looks to negotiate a bilateral deal and threatens auto tariffs.
The visit to France comes at a sensitive time, with ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn, who holds French citizenship, back behind bars in Tokyo.
He was re-arrested last week while out on bail and faces multiple charges of financial misconduct.
Abe said the trip was intended to "affirm close co-operation for success in the G20 summit in Osaka", which will be held June 28 and 29.
Trump is also expected to visit Japan in May to become the first foreign head of state to meet Japan\'s new emperor, Naruhito, who will be enthroned on May 1.


UNITED NATIONS (AP) - France and Germany announced the launch Tuesday of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres\', poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us - it is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."


DINARD, France, April 6 (Reuters) - Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven nations broadly agreed on issues during a two-day meeting, but were unable to bridge differences on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and how to deal with Iran, France\'s top diplomat said on Saturday.
"Despite the crisp air of Dinard, we couldn\'t overcome some of our differences," Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said at the end of a two-day meeting in western France. "I think the talks were constructive and pleasant both in tone and in the fundamentals."
Le Drian, whose country has been criticised for supporting Libyan eastern commander Khalifa Haftar, said rival factions in Libya needed to hold back and that Haftar should accept a U.N.-backed peace effort. (Reporting by John Irish; editing by Richard Lough)


HONG KONG (AP) - Fiji won a record fifth Hong Kong Sevens rugby trophy at Hong Kong stadium on Sunday, beating France 21- 7 in the final.
Fiji opened the scoring with a try by Wilimoni Boitu in the fifth minute and then another by Aminiasi Tuimaba on the half-time whistle to go into the break 14-0 up.
France scored a penalty try in the second half to close to within seven points with five minutes left on the clock after Josua Vakurinabili was sent to the sin-bin for a high tackle that prevented Gabin Villiere from scoring.
France\'s advantage did not last long with Tavite Veredamu deemed guilty of the same infringement on Paula Dranisinukula to make it six on six.
Tuimaba made the most of the extra space to score again in front of the Fijian supporters.
Fiji, with the crowd firmly behind the team, looked unstoppable all week, beating Argentina 29-24 in Sunday\'s quarter finals before disposing of league leaders United States 28-19 in the semifinals. The win takes Fiji to 123 points and second in the 2019 world series standings.

France beat 12-time series winners New Zealand in a close 14-12 quarter final Sunday before beating Samoa 19-12 en route to the finals.
Second place puts France 9th in the overall rankings before moving on to the next world series clash in Singapore.
The U.S. and Samoa faced off in the third-place match in the day\'s penultimate clash. Tries from Marceo Brown, Carlin Isles, Joel Schroeder and Marcus Tupuola had the U.S. prevail 22-10 to secure 17 points to stay atop of the standings, seven points clear of Fiji.
Argentina won the fifth-place plate with a last-minute try, adding 13 points to their total to take them to 6th in the standings while their opponents New Zealand are third with 118 points. South Africa remain fourth with 99 points.
Meanwhile, Hong Kong made the qualifiers\' final in front of their home crowd for the second year in a row, losing to Ireland 28-7.

Britain faces an economic downturn after the dominant services sector slammed into reverse.
In a sign that political turmoil over Brexit is spilling into the real world, a report by the research firm IHS Markit suggested the economy is already shrinking.
The group has also warned of a sharp slowdown in the eurozone as factory output slumps in Germany and French business falters. The bleak assessment came as Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, said 70 per cent of countries face a slowdown this year.
Face-off:\xc2\xa0Britain faces an economic downturn after the dominant services sector slammed into reverse
Speaking ahead of next week\'s annual meetings of the IMF in Washington, Lagarde warned high debt and low interest rates meant many economies \'have left limited room to act when the next downturn comes\'.
She added: \'A year ago, I said, \'The sun is shining, fix the roof.\'
\'Six months ago, I pointed to clouds of risk on the horizon. Today, the weather is increasingly unsettled.\'
Markit found that output by UK services firms contracted last month for the first time in two-and-a-half years.
The firm\'s index of activity in the sector, which includes everything from hairdressers to investment banks, fell from 51.3 in February to 48.9 in March. Scores below 50 show contraction.
The figures were seen as a major warning sign because services make up 80pc of the British economy. They suggest the economy shrank in March and may have been stagnant in the first quarter of 2019.
Separate statistics this week showed that UK manufacturers are still growing, but this may only be because they are scrambling to build up stockpiles to guard against trade disruption linked to Brexit.
Chris Williamson, of Markit, said that the bleak figures suggest economists\' forecasts for 1.3 per cent growth this year are far too optimistic.
Even Markit\'s own forecast of only 0.8 per cent growth could be too positive if deadlock over Brexit continues, Williamson said.
He added: \'Both the services and construction sectors are now in decline, and manufacturing is only expanding because of emergency stockpiling ahead of Brexit.
\'The underlying picture of demand is even worse than the headline numbers suggest.
Bleak assessment: IMF chief Christine Lagarde\xc2\xa0
\'A stalling of the economy in the first quarter will therefore likely turn into a downturn in the second quarter unless demand revives suddenly which, given the recent escalation of Brexit uncertainty, seems highly improbable.\'
Firms which responded to the Markit survey said their corporate clients have put off spending decisions until there is more clarity on Brexit.
As well as Brexit, the UK economy has been buffeted by problems in the eurozone.
Italy entered recession last year and the crucial German manufacturing sector is shrinking at its fastest rate since July 2012, during the single currency bloc\'s debt crisis. The Markit surveys are not always an accurate way of predicting the future, particularly in uncertain times, when the bosses who respond may overstate the problems they face.
For example, the surveys pointed to a severe recession immediately after the Brexit vote, when in reality the economy continued to grow at a robust pace.
James Smith, an economist at the investment bank ING, said: \'The survey makes it clear that the economy is being hit hard by all the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.
\'Of course, it\'s important to remember that the surveys don\'t always precisely reflect the extent of a slowdown, merely that an increasing number of firms are reporting worsening conditions.
\'That said, this latest reading implies that the first quarter as a whole could see near-stagnant growth.\'


A trade union boss has been accused of hypocrisy after it emerged her female staff earn less than their male colleagues.
Frances O\'Grady called for big employers to do more after figures released last week showed nearly half of all major British companies failed to reduce their gender pay gap over the last year.
But figures show a gap exists within the TUC\'s own employees, with women at the organisation now earning 94p for every \xc2\xa31 earned by a man.
Two years ago there was no gap at the union between what women and men were paid, according to figures from the\xc2\xa0Gender Pay Gap Service.
O\xe2\x80\x99Grady, who is the TUC general secretary, saw her pay grow last year by \xc2\xa318,000 - bringing her total package to \xc2\xa3175,000 a year.\xc2\xa0
TUC general secretary Frances O\'Grady told big employers to do more to tackle their gender pay gaps. She is pictured speaking at a trade union press conference on Brexit
She recently criticised firms that did not tackle the their own gender pay gaps and called bosses who did not take action to be fined.
Earlier this week she said: \'Big employers clearly aren\'t doing enough to tackle the root causes of pay inequality and working women are paying the price.
\'Government needs to crank up the pressure. Companies shouldn\'t just be made to publish their gender pay gaps; they should be legally required to explain how they\'ll close them, and bosses who flout the law should be fined.\'\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
New figures published last week showed nearly half of all major British companies have failed to reduce their gender pay gap over the last year.
Of the organisations which met last week\'s deadline for reporting gender pay figures, 78 per cent have shown a gap in favour of men - despite Theresa May vowing last year to tackle the \'burning injustice\' of unequal pay.
The gap actually became bigger in 45 per cent of companies - mainly due to men\'s earnings rising faster than women\'s.
A TUC spokesman said that the shift in the union\'s pay gap was down to it being a small organisation that had seen recent changes to staff members.\xc2\xa0
He said: \'We keep a careful eye on our pay gap data, which we publish voluntarily.\xc2\xa0
Frances O\'Grady\xc2\xa0after a meeting at 10 Downing Street in January to discuss Brexit\xc2\xa0
\'As a small organisation, a few staffing changes can have a big impact on our headline figures.\xc2\xa0
\'We have put robust measures in place to ensure a low pay gap including transparent pay structures and generous childcare policies, and we\'ll continue to monitor and update our action plan.\'
Other unions also have wide gender pay gaps, including Unite the Union, where women earn 28 per cent less than their male counterparts.\xc2\xa0
Public sector union, Unison, which is the largest in the UK, sees female employees earn\xc2\xa085p for every \xc2\xa31 a male worker earned, according to the figures.
Nearly half of all major British companies failed to reduce their gender pay gap over the last year, the figures revealed.\xc2\xa0
Employers whose gender pay gap increased in size year-on-year also include Huddersfield Town FC, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Dyfed-Powys Police, Ryanair and Kwik Fit.\xc2\xa0


PARIS (AP) - The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.

LONDON (AP) - The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."

Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."


US President Donald Trump says he\'ll be attending Normandy 75th anniversary ceremonies at a meeting with WWII veterans and their families in the Oval Office
US President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will attend ceremonies to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy that broke Nazi Germany\'s grip on France.
"I\'ll be there," he told reporters in the White House.
Operation Overlord was launched on June 6, 1944, sending waves of US and other Allied soldiers onto the French coast where they dislodged German forces and began the liberation of France and the eventual battle for Germany itself, ending in defeat for the Nazis.
The Normandy trip will add to a relatively busy summer of international travel for Trump, who is also expected to go to Japan twice and to a G7 summit in August in Biarritz, France.


PARIS, April 9 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May must present a clear and credible way out of the turmoil surrounding Britain\'s exit from the European Union for France to accept a delay, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Tuesday.
"There is need for clarity on why the delay and how it will in the end facilitate an agreement," Le Maire told Franceinfo television.
Asked whether a no-deal was inevitable if May failed, Le Maire replied: "I prefer an agreement. But Theresa May should give us the reasons why she wants the delay and these reasons must be credible."
May is traveling to Berlin and Paris on Tuesday to meet the EU\'s two leading power brokers ahead of a crunch summit on Wednesday at which EU leaders will decide on a further extension. (Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by Bate Felix)


PARIS (AP) - The beIN Sports television network and commentator Daniel Bravo have apologized after Bravo described Strasbourg striker Nuno Da Costa\'s statistics as "not bad for a black."
Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.
Da Costa wrote: "No worries, a tongue slip happens, he works too much. beIN SPORTS, stop mid-week games please."

HONG KONG (AP) - Fiji won a record fifth Hong Kong Sevens rugby trophy at Hong Kong stadium on Sunday, beating France 21- 7 in the final.
Fiji opened the scoring with a try by Wilimoni Boitu in the fifth minute and then another by Aminiasi Tuimaba on the half-time whistle to go into the break 14-0 up.
France scored a penalty try in the second half to close to within seven points with five minutes left on the clock after Josua Vakurinabili was sent to the sin-bin for a high tackle that prevented Gabin Villiere from scoring.
France\'s advantage did not last long with Tavite Veredamu deemed guilty of the same infringement on Paula Dranisinukula to make it six on six.
Tuimaba made the most of the extra space to score again in front of the Fijian supporters.
Fiji, with the crowd firmly behind the team, looked unstoppable all week, beating Argentina 29-24 in Sunday\'s quarter finals before disposing of league leaders United States 28-19 in the semifinals. The win takes Fiji to 123 points and second in the 2019 world series standings.

France beat 12-time series winners New Zealand in a close 14-12 quarter final Sunday before beating Samoa 19-12 en route to the finals.
Second place puts France 9th in the overall rankings before moving on to the next world series clash in Singapore.
The U.S. and Samoa faced off in the third-place match in the day\'s penultimate clash. Tries from Marceo Brown, Carlin Isles, Joel Schroeder and Marcus Tupuola had the U.S. prevail 22-10 to secure 17 points to stay atop of the standings, seven points clear of Fiji.
Argentina won the fifth-place plate with a last-minute try, adding 13 points to their total to take them to 6th in the standings while their opponents New Zealand are third with 118 points. South Africa remain fourth with 99 points.
Meanwhile, Hong Kong made the qualifiers\' final in front of their home crowd for the second year in a row, losing to Ireland 28-7.

BERLIN (AP) - The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."

France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Am\xc3\xa9lie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.

A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."

BUCHAREST, April 5 (Reuters) - The French government is preparing measures to prevent activist funds destabilising French companies, the country\'s finance minister told Reuters in an interview.
Activist funds are increasingly active in Europe, buying up stakes in companies they feel are underperforming and pushing for changes in strategy to extract more value for shareholders.
The practise has been common in the U.S. for many years but slower to take off in Europe as big stakes held by founding families or even the state proved a deterrent.
In France, New York hedge fund Elliott Management is currently piling pressure on drinks giant Pernod Ricard , CIAM is tussling with reinsurer Scor, Amber Capital has acquired a stake in Lagardere and Searchlight Capital Partners said earlier this week it was investing in aeronautics company Latecoere.
"I am thinking about new national instruments that would make it possible to better resist activist funds," Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Reuters in Bucharest, where he was attending an EU finance ministers meeting.
The plan would make it possible for the state to invest in companies it deemed to be of national interest, he said, declining to give further details other than saying the proposals would be ready in the coming months.
"It\'s a subject I follow very closely because an activist fund that destroys value does not conform with the new capitalism I want to build," he added.
Le Maire has championed an overhaul of French corporate law encouraging long-term investment and employee profit-sharing schemes. Parliament is due to vote on the legislation next week.
Le Maire said there was a place for investment funds which helped improve a company\'s performance, but activist funds that destroyed longer-term value by trying to boost short-term profitability "should be fought".
Elliott\'s campaign to improve profit margins and corporate governance at Pernod has fuelled concerns that no company is immune.
Not only does the group\'s founding family hold a large stake, it is generally considered to be well managed already.
Last month, France\'s Bpifrance pubic investment bank said it had 2 billion euros available to fend off potential activist attacks on French firms if needed.
Through the bank, the French government last week increased its stake in car parts maker Valeo, which has previously been targeted by activist investors.
Valeo also currently counts among its shareholders Chicago-based activist Harris Associates, which after Bpifrance\'s move said it supported management. (Reporting by Leigh Thomas; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)


PARIS, April 10 (Reuters) - The French foreign ministry said on Wednesday it regretted a decision by Algerian authorities to expel Agence France-Presse\'s bureau chief in the country.
"We regret this decision and we would like to once again highlight the importance we attach towards the freedom of the press and the protection of journalists throughout the world," a spokesperson for the ministry said in an electronic briefing.
Aymeric Vincenot, who had been AFP\'s Algiers bureau chief since June 2017, had a visa extension request turned down by Algerian officials and returned to Paris on Tuesday, an editor at the agency told Reuters.

PARIS, April 5 (Reuters) - France considers as premature talks of granting Britain another extension to the Brexit negotiation period, a source close to French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday.
The French diplomatic source slammed as "clumsy" comments by an EU official mentioning a "flexible extension" of the date of the country\'s exit from the European Union of up to one year.
"It is premature to talk of an extension despite the fact the 27 had set a clear pre-condition: the need for a credible alternative plan justifying this request. We\'re not there today," the source told Reuters.
"Rumours about this extension are a clumsy trial balloon, the different options will be discussed on April 10 and nothing has been decided," the source added.
"In any case, we need a clear plan from London by Tuesday," the source said.
The chairman of European Union leaders Donald Tusk is likely to offer Britain a flexible extension of the date of the country\'s exit from the EU of up to one year, with the possibility of leaving sooner, a senior EU official said earlier.

PARIS, April 4 (Reuters) - France\'s CRE energy market regulator will publish its recommendations for the 600 megawatt (MW) Dunkirk offshore wind farm tender in early May, and it expects the price to be reasonable, the head of the regulatory body said on Thursday.
"We will get reasonable prices for the Dunkirk offshore tender," Jean-Francois Carenco told a French parliamentary commission hearing on the renewables energy sector.
The CRE makes its recommendations to the government, which will announce the final decision based on the regulator\'s advice.
The Dunkirk tender has attracted interests from several international and French energy companies.
These include French state-controlled utility EDF, in partnership with Germany\'s Innogy and Canada\'s Enbridge, as well as one from Engie which has teamed up with Portugal\'s EDPR.
Oil major Total has also partnered up with Denmark\'s Orsted and renewable energy producer Elicio for the tender. (Reporting by Bate Felix; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta)

BRUSSELS, April 10 (Reuters) - Germany, France, Luxembourg and the EU\'s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier favoured a shorter delay to Britain\'s departure from the bloc in talks on the eve of a summit of EU leaders in Brussels, a document seen by Reuters showed.
EU leaders meeting on Wednesday are set to grant Britain a second delay to Brexit but have not yet decided how long this new extension should be.
Britain\'s Prime Minister Theresa May has asked for an extension until June 30. Summit chair Donald Tusk favours a longer, flexible Brexit delay of up to 12 months.
EU ministers on Tuesday were divided on the duration of the extension, the document shows.
Those backing a shorter respite for Britain said it would keep up pressure on the divided British parliament to ratify the withdrawal agreement May reached with the EU in November.
Germany was among those expressing support for a shorter extension at the meeting in Luxembourg, the document shows.
That appeared to contrast with what German Chancellor Angela Merkel told the German parliament on Wednesday when she favoured an extension of "several months".
France also supported a shorter extension at that meeting, in line with its harder line on Brexit.
At the meeting, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic preferred a longer postponement, saying it could scare Brexit supporters in Britain into backing May\'s exit deal over fears Britain might otherwise never leave the EU.
"Almost all delegations expressed an openness to an extension," the document says, "but many attached clear conditions", including a credible exit plan to be submitted by May.
The extension should be "commensurate" to the purpose that it plans to serve, EU ministers said, according to the document.
At the meeting, Barnier also said should the United Kingdom opt for a customs union with the EU after Brexit, it would solve the problem of customs checks on the Irish border, but industry regulation checks would still be required.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - France and Germany announced the launch Tuesday of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres\', poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us - it is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."


PARIS, France, April 11 (Reuters) - France will vote against the opening of trade negotiations between the European Union and United States because of repeated trade threats from Washington and its decision to quit the Paris climate accord, an Elysee official said on Thursday.
"France does not want a trade war or tension with the United States", added the source, who declined to be named, adding that it was likely France would be the only party to oppose opening the talks.
European Union countries gave initial clearance on Thursday to start formal trade talks with the United States, EU sources said, a move designed but not guaranteed to smooth strained relations between the world\'s two largest economies.
The French move does not block opening of the trade negotiations because the necessary majority of EU member states backs it.
"What we\'re saying is we aren\'t going to reward the United States in this context," the official said, referring to threats in recent days to take action over the pricing of European Airbus airliners.
"We have never believed in the idea of showing weakness to win favours from (President Donald) Trump, so the idea that we can improve our situation through concessions by giving into pressure is not a good one," the official said.

PARIS (AP) - The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.

Japan\'s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will vist the US, Canada and France ahead of the G20 summit scheduled for Osaka at the end of June
Japan\'s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced Monday plans to visit the United States, Canada and France this month before his country hosts the G20 later this year.
The tour from April 22 to 29 will also include stops in Italy, Belgium and Slovakia, a foreign ministry official said.
The trip comes ahead of long-awaited trade talks between Washington and Tokyo, as US President Donald Trump looks to negotiate a bilateral deal and threatens auto tariffs.
The visit to France comes at a sensitive time, with ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn, who holds French citizenship, back behind bars in Tokyo.
He was re-arrested last week while out on bail and faces multiple charges of financial misconduct.
Abe said the trip was intended to "affirm close co-operation for success in the G20 summit in Osaka", which will be held June 28 and 29.
Trump is also expected to visit Japan in May to become the first foreign head of state to meet Japan\'s new emperor, Naruhito, who will be enthroned on May 1.


DUBLIN, April 9 (Reuters) - Ireland\'s prime minister expressed confidence that his French counterpart was open to offering Britain an extension to Brexit talks after the pair met last week, but that President Emmanuel Macron favoured setting strict conditions.
"I\'m always reluctant to act as a spokesperson for a head of state for another country but I think it\'s fair to say that he is certainly open to it (an extension). I\'ve no reason to believe, despite suggestions in some newspapers, that France would even consider vetoing it," Leo Varadkar told Ireland\'s parliament.
"But he (Macron) certainly wants to know about conditionality, particularly the issue of the United Kingdom being involved in future decision making. If they\'re leaving, should they be involved in shaping the new CAP (Common Agricultural Policy), the MFF (EU budget), in electing the next president of the Commission."

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - France, Germany and Britain are expressing concern that Iran\'s latest ballistic missile activity is part of a trend of developing missiles capable of delivering a nuclear weapon.
Ambassadors from the three U.N. Security Council nations said in a letter to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres circulated Tuesday that Iran\'s latest buildout and launching of ballistic missiles is having a destabilizing effect in the Middle East and increasing existing tensions.
The Western allies said Iran\'s activities are "inconsistent" with a 2015 council resolution calling on it not to undertake any action involving missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.
They pointed to Iran\'s launch of a Dousti satellite, its unveiling of a Dezful surface-to-surface ballistic missile, and its public display of a variation of the Khorramshahr ballistic missile, all in February.


WASHINGTON (AP) - Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.


NEW YORK, April 2 (Reuters) - The foreign ministers of Germany and France called for more clarity from London on Tuesday after British Prime Minister Theresa May said she would seek a further delay to Britain\'s withdrawal from the European Union.
"I\'m tempted to say let us know if something changes," said France\'s Jean-Yves Le Drian at a joint press conference the two held in New York. "Three years after their decision, the British must come up with a clear line because otherwise, sadly, it\'ll be a hard Brexit in coming days."
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas declined to comment on the request for an extension but urged London to move swiftly: "That we\'re long past five after midnight - they must know that in London, too." (Reporting by Michelle Nichols in New York, writing by Thomas Escritt Editing by Gareth Jones)


BRUSSELS (AP) - French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.

French authorities say 21 migrants have been rescued while trying to reach Britain by crossing the English Channel in small boats.
A regional maritime authority said in a statement Tuesday that a helicopter and coast guard ship retrieved nine migrants from a boat with a dead engine in waters off Calais.
A separate operation rescued 12 migrants, including two children, from another boat off Boulogne-sur-Mer.
The statement says two passengers had mild hypothermia, and all were brought back to France.

Sea-Eye said Tuesday that it has informed Malta, the nearest port, of the scarcity of food and water for the migrants, including 12 women, a child and an infant.
The European Union, meanwhile, said it had triggered talks with member states to identify a port and countries to take in the migrants, as the nearest countries, Malta and Italy, have refused to allow port access to any NGO rescue ship.
Sea-Eye spokesman Dominik Reisinger said the "political question about the distribution of the rescued ... overshadows the human rights" of those on board.

PARIS, April 9 (Reuters) - France called on Tuesday for avoiding any escalation of tensions in the Middle East region after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would name Iran\'s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization.
Asked about the U.S. move, the French foreign ministry replied in an electronic press briefing that France remained committed to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
"We urge people to avoid escalating tensions or destabilizing the region," the ministry added.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will skip a meeting of Group of Seven foreign ministers in France
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will skip a meeting of Group of Seven ministers this week in France, the State Department said Tuesday, amid persistent tensions between Europe and President Donald Trump.
Officials did not explain Pompeo\'s absence. But the move comes amid a long list of disagreements, including the US rejection of international agreements on ending Iran\'s nuclear program and fighting climate change.
The State Department said that Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan would represent the United States and be joined by David Hale, the top-ranking US career diplomat, at the talks Friday and Saturday in Dinard on the coast of Brittany.
Sullivan "will engage in discussions on a broad range of issues, including the deteriorating situation in Venezuela, destabilizing Iranian behavior in the Middle East, the responsible conduct of states in cyber space and the final denuclearization of North Korea," a State Department statement said.
Asked to explain Pompeo\'s absence, State Department spokesman Robert Palladino gave no specific reason but said: "Trans-Atlantic alliances are stronger than ever."
Pompeo has "full faith" in Sullivan "and his ability to advance America\'s national security interests," Palladino said.
Pompeo will already be seeing several of his G7 counterparts Wednesday and Thursday in Washington at a 70th anniversary gathering of the NATO alliance, but he has no announced conflicting engagements later in the week.
The Group of Seven is the longstanding club of major industrialized democracies, with their summits often steering the global agenda.
Besides the United States and France, the group includes Britain, Canada, Germany, Italy and Japan.
French President Emmanuel Macron is hoping to push an ambitious agenda at the G7 summit in August in the resort of Biarritz, for which the foreign ministers meeting is meant to prepare.
The French hosts are no doubt mindful of lessons from the last G7 in Canada, where Trump refused to sign the final communique and openly criticized his host, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, over trade policies.


France has ruled out repatriating\xc2\xa0jihadists and their families from Syria following furious backlash at reports 250 of them would be allowed to return.
Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told a press conference in Paris on Friday: \'No communal repatriation was under consideration to be carried out.\'
It had been reported that in early March the government was prepared to bring home around 250 men, women and children from the former \'caliphate,\' which brought widespread public backlash.\xc2\xa0

Castaner said: \'It\'s logical that our services considered all hypotheses. This was one of the hypothesis they prepared.\'
However, he reiterated that France would nonetheless study bringing back children of jihadist fighters on a \'case-by-case basis\'.\xc2\xa0
He denied Liberation\'s claim that France\'s policy with regards to fighters in Syria was being dictated by public opinion.
Last month, French authorities for the first time brought home five orphaned children of French jihadists\' from camps in northeast Syria.
According to the UN children\'s agency UNICEF, around 3,000 foreign children from 43 countries are housed at the Al-Hol camp in Syria alone, which has taken in most of the people fleeing IS\'s self-proclaimed \'caliphate\' in recent weeks.

Up to 1,700 French nationals are thought to have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight with the jihadists between 2014 and 2018, according to government figures. Around 300 are believed to have died in combat.
Kurdish officials have warned they do not have the resources to hold all the captured fighters indefinitely, and Washington is also urging its allies in the anti-IS coalition to take home their citizens.
But repatriation is a politically fraught issue, and governments fear they may not have enough evidence to convict IS members who claim they did not fight.

SHANGHAI, April 3 (Reuters) - French oil and gas major Total SA and U.S. company Tellurian Inc have signed deals supporting the development of the proposed $30 billion Driftwood liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, the two firms said on Wednesday.
Under a non-binding heads of agreement (HOA), Total will invest in Driftwood Holdings and will offtake 2.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG.
The HOA is for Total to make a $500 million equity investment in the integrated Driftwood project in Louisiana and to buy one mtpa of LNG from Driftwood.
In addition, the HOA specifies that both companies will enter into a binding sales and purchase agreement (SPA) for a further 1.5 mtpa of LNG from Tellurian Marketing\'s LNG offtake volumes from the proposed Driftwood terminal.
The SPA is for the purchase of LNG on a free-on-board (FOB) basis for a minimum of 15 years, at a price based on Platts Japan Korea Marker (JKM).
Both companies also signed a common stock purchase agreement in which Total will buy nearly 20 million shares of Tellurian common stock for $200 million.
Including Total\'s original $207 million investment in Tellurian in 2017, Total\'s aggregate investment in the Tellurian portfolio will amount to $907 million, Tellurian said in a press release.
The agreements are subject to relevant regulatory approvals and to a final investment decision on the Driftwood LNG project, which is expected to be made by Tellurian in the first half of this year.
"With this deal, we will have 10 million tonnes exposure in North America," said Total\'s chief executive Patrick Pouyanne on the sidelines of the LNG2019 conference in Shanghai.
It will also be the French major\'s first deal priced off JKM, which is a fast developing Asian benchmark for spot cargoes.
"JKM makes sense for our global portfolio," Pouyanne said.
Tellurian plans to make a final investment decision on its Driftwood LNG export project in the first half of 2019 for phase 1.
The project is expected to produce first LNG in 2023, with full operations expected in 2026.
In total, Driftwood will produce 27.6 mtpa of LNG or about 4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas.
The FID for the second phase of the project is expected about 12 to 18 months after construction starts on phase 1, said Meg Gentle, chief executive of Tellurian. (Reporting by Meng Meng and David Stanway in SHANGHAI, writing by Jessica Jaganathan; editing by Richard Pullin)


BERLIN (AP) - The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."

France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Am\xc3\xa9lie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.

8:45 a.m.
A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."

PARIS, April 9 (Reuters) - Britain should not be allowed to take part in European Union budget talks or choosing the next head of the European Commission if it takes part in next month\'s elections because of a delay to Brexit, a French presidency official said on Tuesday.
Any further extension handed to Britain must protect the smooth running of EU institutions and the remaining 27 states could demand periodic reviews of whether London is honoring commitments not to obstruct the bloc\'s decision-making.

When Virginia Hall, pictured, was born on April 6, 1906, espionage seemed the least likely path for the only daughter of one of Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s prominent families. Her mother, Barbara, had hoped for an \xe2\x80\x98advantageous marriage\xe2\x80\x99 to help the family\xe2\x80\x99s dwindling fortune, according to a new book,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98A Woman of No Importance: The Untold Story of the American Spy Who Helped Win World War II\xe2\x80\x99 by Sonia Purnell
The odds of success, let alone survival, were not high for Virginia Hall when she was sent to spy behind enemy lines during World War II.
She was a one-legged, 35-year-old American and a former desk clerk. But she flourished where others failed, and helped to build a Resistance network in France when a Nazi victory seemed inevitable. Along the way, Hall was branded the \xe2\x80\x98most dangerous spy\xe2\x80\x99 by the Germans and the Gestapo hunted her relentlessly.
Hall spoke five languages, went by many code names, and could switch her appearance multiple times in an afternoon. She cultivated contacts, planned a daring and successful prison escape for her fellow agents, and later on during the war \xe2\x80\x93 with the Nazis hot on her heels \xe2\x80\x93 recruited and led guerrilla groups whose sabotage missions of blowing up bridges and cutting off communications helped the Allied effort after D-Day.
A new book, \xe2\x80\x98A Woman of No Importance: The Untold Story of the American Spy Who Helped Win World War II\xe2\x80\x99 by Sonia Purnell, creates a detailed picture of an extraordinary and tenacious woman who long \xe2\x80\x98operated in the shadows,\xe2\x80\x99 and desired no accolades for her bravery. The book is the basis for a slated movie set to star Daisy Ridley.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
\xe2\x80\x98This book is\xe2\x80\xa6 an attempt to reveal how one woman really did help turn the tide of history,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote.
Repeatedly rejected for a diplomatic position with the U.S. State Department, Hall first worked for British intelligence for what was called the Special Operations Executive, using the cover of a New York Post reporter. Later on, she was an agent for the United States\xe2\x80\x99 Office of Strategic Services, which was the forerunner to the Central Intelligence Agency.
American Virginia Hall, pictured above in a sketch and a photo, first worked for British intelligence for what was called the Special Operations Executive, or SOE. \xe2\x80\x98No one in London gave Agent 3844 more than a fifty-fifty chance of surviving even the first few days. For all Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s qualities, dispatching a one-legged thirty-five-year-old desk clerk on a blind mission into wartime France was on paper an almost insane gamble,\xe2\x80\x99 Sonia Purnell wrote in her new book, \xe2\x80\x98A Woman of No Importance: The Untold Story of the American Spy Who Helped Win World War II\'
Hall first set up shop in Vichy in the so-called Free Zone, and set about establishing her bona fides for her cover, a reporter for the New York Post. The \xe2\x80\x98statuesque, flame-haired newcomer with an aristocratic bearing,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote, was able to make inroads, and she became friends with Suzanne Bertillon, who despite working as a censor of foreign press for the Vichy government, helped Hall by setting up contacts throughout the country that provided her with information, which \xe2\x80\x98proved vital for the British war effort,\xe2\x80\x99 such as German troop movements. Above, Hall with Paul Goillot, right, whom she would later marry, and Henry Riley, left, and Lieutenant Aimart, center, in France in 1944
After Vichy, Hall moved to Lyon, where rumblings of rebellion were stirring. \xe2\x80\x98She learned how to change her appearance within minutes depending on whom she was meeting,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote. \xe2\x80\x98Altering her hairstyle, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, putting on glasses, changing her makeup, wearing different gloves to hide her hands, or even inserting slivers of rubber into her mouth to puff out her cheeks: it all worked surprisingly well.\xe2\x80\x99 Recruiting people for the Resistance, and, moreover, then waiting until action was called for was difficult and Purnell noted that Hall\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98early days in Lyon\xe2\x80\x99 were \xe2\x80\x98extremely rough.\xe2\x80\x99 Above, Hall, the only woman center right, with those who were part of the Resistance in France against the Nazis in 1944
Despite the Nazis looking for her, Hall returned to France in March 1944 \xe2\x80\x93 this time working for the United States\' Office of Strategic Services. \xe2\x80\x98The risk involved was just incredible really,\xe2\x80\x99 author Purnell told DailyMail.com. Hall was eventually tasked with recruiting guerrilla groups for sabotage.\xc2\xa0After D-Day on June 6, 1944, when the Allies stormed Normandy in France, Resistance groups were crucial and \xe2\x80\x98created serious military diversions that together with massive Allied bombardment prevented the Wehrmacht (German armed forces) from re-forming against the Allied forces father north and south,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote. Hall\xe2\x80\x99s sabotage missions were \xe2\x80\x98among the more successful at the time,\xe2\x80\x99 according to the book. Above, an example of sabotage during the war. A railway bridge in Chamalieres, France was blown up in August 1944
After the war, despite being a hero with field experience, the CIA would fail, at times, to use her talents properly or promote her as they would a man \xe2\x80\x93 to the point that Hall became the agency\xe2\x80\x99s textbook example of discrimination, according to the book.
\xe2\x80\x98She had a lot of rejection during her own lifetime - unbelievably cruel and misguided and awful,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell told DailyMail.com. \xe2\x80\x98She didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel sorry for herself and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t complain. She was just determined and had such courage and she just kept at it.\xe2\x80\x99
When Virginia Hall was born on April 6, 1906, espionage seemed the least likely path for the only daughter of one of Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s prominent families. Her mother, Barbara, hoped for what Purnell called an \xe2\x80\x98advantageous marriage\xe2\x80\x99 to help the family\xe2\x80\x99s dwindling fortune.
Nicknamed \xe2\x80\x98Dindy,\xe2\x80\x99 Hall once sported a \xe2\x80\x98bracelet\xe2\x80\x99 of live snakes to school, described herself as \xe2\x80\x98cantankerous and capricious,\xe2\x80\x99 and was a natural leader who got elected class president. She was engaged at aged 19, but broke it off and first attended Radcliffe College (now part of Harvard) in 1924, and then transferred to Barnard College the following year, according to the book.
Hall craved a career and her ambition would take her from Barnard, where Purnell remarked she was \xe2\x80\x98an average student,\xe2\x80\x99 to live in Paris, a mecca for American expats like Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, at aged 20. She studied at the Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques, what is now the prestigious Sciences Po, and at the Konsular Akademie in Vienna.
After three years in Europe, Hall spoke French, German, Spanish, Italian and Russian. She was well-versed in its politics, had \xe2\x80\x98a deep and abiding love of France,\xe2\x80\x99 and as Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini were on the rise, \xe2\x80\x98she was thus witness to the dark clouds of nationalism gathering across the horizon,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote.
She came back to Maryland in July 1929 \xe2\x80\x93 months before the stock market crash that was the start of the country\xe2\x80\x99s Great Depression. What remained of her family\xe2\x80\x99s fortune was lost, and Hall went to graduate school at the George Washington University in Washington, DC. She then applied to become a professional diplomat with the U.S. State Department but was rejected, with Purnell noting that they \xe2\x80\x98seemed unwilling to welcome women in their rank.\xe2\x80\x99 It would not be the last time.
Nonetheless, Hall started working for the department as a clerk, first at the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw, then in Turkey. It was in Turkey that her life took a different turn.
In December 1933, Hall had organized a shooting exhibition for a type of bird called a snipe, and somehow, while out in the wetlands, she \xe2\x80\x98stumbled. As she fell, her gun slipped off her shoulder and got caught in her ankle-length coat. She reached out to grab it, but in doing so fired a round at point-blank range into her foot,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote. \xe2\x80\x98The wound was serious.\xe2\x80\x99
Initially, it seemed as if Hall would recover, but \xe2\x80\x98gangrene had taken hold and was fast spreading up her lower leg,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98on the brink of death,\xe2\x80\x99 the doctors amputated her left leg \xe2\x80\x98below the knee in a last-ditch bid\xe2\x80\x99 to save the 27-year-old, she wrote.
The ordeal, however, was not over, and Hall had sepsis, \xe2\x80\x98a potentially life-threatening condition caused by the body\'s response to an infection,\xe2\x80\x99 according to the Mayo Clinic\xe2\x80\x99s website. In a tremendous amount of pain, Hall saw her father, who had died almost three years earlier, at her bedside, telling her \xe2\x80\x9cit was her duty to survive,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the book. Hall pulled through, and her father\xe2\x80\x99s words would stay with her \xe2\x80\x93 especially for the difficult moments that were to come.
Sonia Purnell, the author of a new book, \'A Woman of No Importance: The Untold Story of the American Spy Who Helped Win World War II,\' that chronicles the life of Virginia Hall, told DailyMail.com that she thought Hall \xe2\x80\x98felt embarrassed\xe2\x80\x99 when people wanted to talk about what she did during the war. She wanted to remain undercover and went to work for the CIA. Above, William \'Wild Bill\' Donovan, right, who was the head of the\xc2\xa0United States\xe2\x80\x99 Office of Strategic Services, awards Hall the Distinguished Service Cross on September 27, 1945 in Washington, DC. According to the book, she was the only civilian woman to receive the medal for \'extraordinary heroism against the enemy\'
For the majority of her time behind enemy lines, Virginia Hall, above in an undated self-portrait, was strict about her security protocols and did not have a boyfriend or take a lover, unlike some of her fellow male agents, which led to leaks and other disastrous consequences, according to the book,\xc2\xa0\'A Woman of No Importance.\' \xe2\x80\x98When she went into the field, I think she was quite used to be very self-sufficient, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t need other people in the same way that a lot of the other agents did, which was their downfall,\xe2\x80\x99 author Sonia Purnell told DailyMail.com
Virginia Hall, pictured, spoke five languages:\xc2\xa0French, German, Spanish, Italian and Russian. She studied both in Paris and Vienna, Austria during the 1920s. When she returned to the United States, she went to graduate school in\xc2\xa0Washington, DC. She then applied to become a professional diplomat with the U.S. State Department but was rejected, with Purnell noting in her new book that they \xe2\x80\x98seemed unwilling to welcome women in their rank.\xe2\x80\x99 It would not be the last time. Nonetheless, Hall worked as a clerk at various American embassies
Hall\'s life would take a different turn when she posted to work at the consulate in Turkey. In December 1933, Hall had organized a shooting exhibition for a type of bird called a snipe, and somehow, while out in the wetlands, she accidentally shot herself in the foot. To save the then 27-year-old\'s life, doctors amputated her left leg due to gangrene, according to a new book called\xc2\xa0\'A Woman of No Importance.\' Nonetheless, Hall eventually went back to work, and her first posting after the accident was in Venice. She is seen above making her way around the city sometime in the 1930s
After Hitler invaded Poland on\xc2\xa0September 1, 1939,\xc2\xa0Hall first tried to join the women\xe2\x80\x99s branch of the British army but was denied because she was American. Next, she went to Paris, where she was finally accepted as a volunteer to drive ambulances for the French army, known as SSA, as seen in the inscription above
Hall then attempted to go back to work at the consulate but it was too soon, and in the summer of 1934, she returned to the U.S. She then had \xe2\x80\x98repair operations,\xe2\x80\x99 and was fitted with a new prosthetic that \xe2\x80\x98although modern by 1930s standard, it was clunky and held in place by leather straps and corsetry around her waist,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote, and \xe2\x80\x98despite being hollow, the painted wooden leg with aluminum foot\xe2\x80\x99 weighed eight pounds.
After learning how to walk again with her false leg, which she named Cuthbert, Hall was back in Europe by November, posted to a consulate in Venice. She then worked in Estonia, and, once again, Hall tried to become a diplomat but was turned down.
\xe2\x80\x98Fearful of the future, all hopes of a promotion dashed, pigeonholed as a disabled woman of no importance, she resigned from the State Department in March 1939,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote.
On September 1, 1939, Hitler invaded Poland. After traveling to London, Hall first tried to join the women\xe2\x80\x99s branch of the British army but was denied because she was American. Next, she went to Paris, where she was finally accepted as a volunteer to drive ambulances for a French regiment.
\xe2\x80\x98After her accident, she had been rejected and now she wanted to prove her worth so badly, wanted to prove what she could still do, not what she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell told DailyMail.com about why Hall decide to take an \xe2\x80\x98insane gamble with her life\xe2\x80\x99 to volunteer in wartime France.
Hall was sent to the France\xe2\x80\x99s northeastern border on May 6, near the Maginot Line, which was supposed to deter the Germans from invading with its fortifications and weapons. Four days later, the Nazis went around the Maginot Line and quickly overrun the French. By June 22, Marshal Philippe Petain signed an armistice with Hitler, dividing the country into the Occupied Zone, under German rule, and the \xe2\x80\x98Free Zone\xe2\x80\x99 or Vichy France with Petain as its leader.
A chance encounter in Spain would ultimately led to Hall spying for the British. While on the way to England after the French surrendered to the Nazis, Hall met British spy George Bellows in August 1940, according to the book.
The United States was still staying out of the war at that point, and would not join the Allies until after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Britain alone at that time stood against Hitler, and its spy network in France had collapsed, Purnell noted in her book.
Bellows was impressed by Hall\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98courage under fire, powers of observation, and most of all her unqualified desire to help the French fight back,\xe2\x80\x99 and so he gave her a number to call while in London, according to the book.
\xe2\x80\x98The number was for Nicolas Bodington, a senior officer in the independent French or F section of a new and controversial British secret service,\xe2\x80\x99 she wrote.
\xe2\x80\x98The Special Operations Executive had been approved on July 19, 1940, the day that Hitler had made a triumphant speech at Reichstag in Berlin, boasting of his victories. In response, Winston Churchill had personally ordered SOE to \xe2\x80\x9cset Europe ablaze\xe2\x80\x9d through an unprecedented onslaught of sabotage, subversion, and spying.\xe2\x80\x99
When she arrived in London, it took her some time before she called the number, and Purnell noted that she was loathe to cause her mom \xe2\x80\x98any more angst\xe2\x80\x99 and was headed back to the U.S. However, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a ticket and met Bodington.
Hall snapped up the job Bodington offered, and, Purnell wrote, she \xe2\x80\x98would be the first female F section agent and the first liaison officer of either sex.\xe2\x80\x99
She and the other SOE officers were to build \xe2\x80\x98up a Resistance network from scratch in a foreign land behind enemy lines,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote, however, \xe2\x80\x98no one had really done\xe2\x80\x99 that before. The \xe2\x80\x98early days were marked by repeated failure\xe2\x80\x99 before Hall, according to the book.
She received a modicum of training, learned the basics of coding and \xe2\x80\x98when she could exercise her license to kill.\xe2\x80\x99 For Hall, her preferred method was what she dubbed the pills, \xe2\x80\x98probably the L or Lethal tablets,\xe2\x80\x99 which were \xe2\x80\x98tiny rubber balls containing potassium cyanide\xe2\x80\x99 that could be used in case she was tortured or to kill, according to the book.\xc2\xa0
When Virginia Hall was born on April 6, 1906, espionage seemed the least likely path for the only daughter of one of Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s prominent families. Her mother, Barbara, hoped for what author Sonia Purnell called an \xe2\x80\x98advantageous marriage\xe2\x80\x99 to help the family\xe2\x80\x99s dwindling fortune. Nicknamed \xe2\x80\x98Dindy,\xe2\x80\x99 Hall once sported a \xe2\x80\x98bracelet\xe2\x80\x99 of live snakes to school, described herself as \xe2\x80\x98cantankerous and capricious,\xe2\x80\x99 and was a natural leader who got elected class president, according to the book\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98A Woman of No Importance.\' Above, Virginia Hall, right, with her father, Ned, center\xc2\xa0
Hall spent time at her family\'s farm, called Boxhorn, above, in Maryland. This experience would serve her later on during the war when she had to live on farms in France. Hall was engaged at aged 19, but broke it off and first attended Radcliffe College (now part of Harvard) in 1924, and then transferred to Barnard College the following year, according to a new book called\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98A Woman of No Importance: The Untold Story of the American Spy Who Helped Win World War II\xe2\x80\x99 by Sonia Purnell\xc2\xa0
Hall, above, craved a career and her ambition would take her from Barnard, where Purnell remarked she was \xe2\x80\x98an average student,\xe2\x80\x99 to live in Paris, a mecca for American expats like Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway and F.

On the left, Hall is seen with her older brother John, and, on the right, Hall during her teenage years sporting pigeons as a hat\xc2\xa0
On August 23, 1941, she left for France.\xc2\xa0
\xe2\x80\x98No one in London gave Agent 3844 more than a fifty-fifty chance of surviving even the first few days. For all Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s qualities, dispatching a one-legged thirty-five-year-old desk clerk on a blind mission into wartime France was on paper an almost insane gamble,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote.\xc2\xa0
In France, Hall first set up shop in Vichy in the so-called Free Zone, and set about establishing her bona fides for her cover, a reporter for the New York Post.
The \xe2\x80\x98statuesque, flame-haired newcomer with an aristocratic bearing,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote, was able to make inroads, and she became friends with Suzanne Bertillon, who despite working as a censor of foreign press for the Vichy government, helped Hall by setting up contacts throughout the country that provided her with information, which \xe2\x80\x98proved vital for the British war effort,\xe2\x80\x99 such as German troop movements.
After Vichy, she moved to Lyon, where rumblings of rebellion were stirring. Hall also changed her hair, dyeing it light brown and wearing tweed suits.
\xe2\x80\x98She learned how to change her appearance within minutes depending on whom she was meeting,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote. \xe2\x80\x98Altering her hairstyle, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, putting on glasses, changing her makeup, wearing different gloves to hide her hands, or even inserting slivers of rubber into her mouth to puff out her cheeks: it all worked surprisingly well.\xe2\x80\x99
\xe2\x80\x98With a little improvisation she could be three or four different women \xe2\x80\x93 Brigitte, Virginia, Marie, or Germaine \xe2\x80\x93 within the space of an afternoon.\xe2\x80\x99
Recruiting people for the Resistance, and, moreover, then waiting until action was called for was difficult and Purnell noted that Hall\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98early days in Lyon\xe2\x80\x99 were \xe2\x80\x98extremely rough.\xe2\x80\x99
The SOE sent other agents into France - some had parachuted in - but the new arrivals would make the fateful decision to meet together at one place. The Vichy French police, who were working with the Nazis, arrested them all. Hall, who did not go to the gathering, was left with three other agents, and was working furiously to make up for lost ground, according to the book.
Hall was strict about her security protocols and did not have a boyfriend or take a lover, unlike some of her fellow male agents, which led to leaks and other disastrous consequences.
\xe2\x80\x98When she went into the field, I think she was quite used to be very self-sufficient, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t need other people in the same way that a lot of the other agents did, which was their downfall,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell said.
French dissidents also \xe2\x80\x98talked loudly and proudly,\xe2\x80\x99 and did things like \xe2\x80\x98used their own names,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell noted in the book. (Later on in the war, there would be rivalry in the Resistance between the Communists and those who supported Charles de Gaulle, the leader of Free France, who was then in London.)
\xe2\x80\x98Everyone feared their neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s ears,\xe2\x80\x99 she wrote, noting that there were more than 1,500 denunciations a day.
\xe2\x80\x98She had once been careless in her life, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t she, and she shot her foot off and I mean that very nearly ended her life and it ended a lot of her dreams and hopes. I think she really was determined that she would never be careless again and everything she did would be precise and rehearsed and practiced and planned and prepared,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell explained.
\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s how she survived and that\xe2\x80\x99s how she succeeded.\xe2\x80\x99
In Lyon, Hall was making one of her best contacts: Germaine Guerin, a 37-year-old \xe2\x80\x9cburning brunette\xe2\x80\x9d who partly owned a brothel that was frequented by \xe2\x80\x98German officers, French police, Vichy officials, and industrialists,\xe2\x80\x99 and who had access to important commodities such as gasoline and coal, according to the book.
\xe2\x80\x98Her clients never thought to doubt her motives let alone search her premises,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote. \xe2\x80\x98She agreed to make parts of her brothel and three other flats available as safe houses (heated by her illicit coal).\xe2\x80\x99
Guerin \xe2\x80\x98was to become an unlikely pillar of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s entire Lyon operation and one of its most heroic agents.\xe2\x80\x99
The women who worked at the brothel also stuck out their necks to get information into Hall\xe2\x80\x99s hands \xe2\x80\x93 they \xe2\x80\x98spiked their clients\xe2\x80\x99 drinks to loosen their tongues, and rifled their pockets for interesting papers to photograph when they slept,\xe2\x80\x99 according to the book.
Hall \'had a lot of rejection during her own lifetime - unbelievably cruel and misguided and awful,\xe2\x80\x99 author Sonia Purnell told DailyMail.com. \xe2\x80\x98She didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel sorry for herself and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t complain. She was just determined and had such courage and she just kept at it.\xe2\x80\x99 Above, the Baltimore Sun ran a story in January 1934 about Hall\'s accident in Turkey while she worked for the consulate. Hall accidentally shot herself in the foot, and doctors amputated her leg to save her life
After Hall\'s accident and recovery, she attempted to go back to work at the consulate but it was too soon, and in the summer of 1934, she returned to the U.S. Hall, pictured, then had \xe2\x80\x98repair operations,\xe2\x80\x99 and was fitted with a new prosthetic that \xe2\x80\x98although modern by 1930s standard, it was clunky and held in place by leather straps and corsetry around her waist,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote, and \xe2\x80\x98despite being hollow, the painted wooden leg with aluminum foot\xe2\x80\x99 weighed eight pounds\xc2\xa0
Sonia Purnell, left, told DailyMail.com it was a huge amount of detective work to write about Virginia Hall for her new book, \xe2\x80\x98A Woman of No Importance: The Untold Story of the American Spy Who Helped Win World War II,\xe2\x80\x99 right. \xe2\x80\x98When you\xe2\x80\x99re writing about a secret agent, they don\xe2\x80\x99t make it easy for you, believe me,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, and then laughed
Hall had successfully organized a Resistance circuit, and word got out about Marie Monin, her alias then, in Lyon. She was able to recruit many different people, such the owner of a lingerie shop, who took messages and signaled with how close or far a pair of mended stockings were in a window, and the elderly women who let the Resistance keep supplies at their antique shop, according to the book.
All knew that the \xe2\x80\x98likely price of capture was death,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote.
Hall was perhaps too successful \xe2\x80\x93 the Nazis were on to the fact that there was a spy in Lyon coordinating people against them, albeit they initially thought it was a man. During a later phase of the war, Lyon and its people would pay the price for their insurgency.
She changed her code name from Marie to Isabelle to then Philomene, according to the book, but the Abwehr, German military intelligence, and the \xe2\x80\x98Gestapo were hell-bent \xe2\x80\x93 separately and in tandem \xe2\x80\x93 on hunting down this notorious agent they knew to be somewhere in the city...\xe2\x80\x99
Klaus Barbie, \xe2\x80\x99the Gestapo\xe2\x80\x99s most notorious investigator \xe2\x80\x93 who would within a year be awarded the Iron Cross (reputedly by Hitler himself) for torturing and slaughtering thousands of resistants \xe2\x80\x93 was also taking a personal interest in Virginia.
\xe2\x80\x98The Limping Lady of Lyon was becoming the Nazis\xe2\x80\x99 most wanted Allied agent in the whole of France,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote, referring to Hall\xe2\x80\x99s gait that was due to her false leg, which she called Cuthbert.
The heat got to be too much, and Hall eventually escaped from France to Spain through an arduous journey that included scaling with Cuthbert an 8,000-foot mountain pass in winter. She made it back to London in January 1943, according to the book.
Purnell wrote: \xe2\x80\x98She had set up vast networks, rescued numerous officers, provided top-grade intelligence, and kept the SOE flag flying through all the tumult. She had almost alone laid the foundations of discipline and hope for the great Resistance battles that were to come.\xe2\x80\x99
But she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t done. Despite the Nazis looking for her, Hall returned to France \xe2\x80\x93 this time working for her country\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Strategic Services. She drastically altered her appearance, donning a disguise of an older peasant woman, and even had her teeth ground down, according to the book.
\xe2\x80\x98The risk involved was just incredible really,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell said.
First, Hall was to scout safe houses for other agents, but she then was tasked with recruiting guerrilla groups for sabotage. She ended up in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, which is in a geographically isolated region that is now known for saving thousands of Jewish lives during the war. She would earn the moniker \xe2\x80\x98Madonna of the Mountains,\xe2\x80\x99 according to the book.
After D-Day on June 6, 1944, when the Allies stormed Normandy in France, Resistance groups were crucial and \xe2\x80\x98created serious military diversions that together with massive Allied bombardment prevented the Wehrmacht (German armed forces) from re-forming against the Allied forces father north and south,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell wrote.
\xe2\x80\x98The movies may sometimes give the impression that success on D-Day marked the end of the worst fighting, but across many areas of France, including Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s, it created new challenges of its own. The remaining Germans \xe2\x80\x93 and their French collaborators \xe2\x80\x93 were edgy, afraid, and more brutal than ever.\xe2\x80\x99
Hall\xe2\x80\x99s sabotage missions were \xe2\x80\x98among the more successful at the time,\xe2\x80\x99 according to the book. She would win commendations for her bravery: a Member of the Order of the British Empire, and a Distinguished Service Cross.
\xe2\x80\x98What was amazing about Virginia was that she was behind enemy lines for the best part of three years and she survived. That was extraordinary,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell said.
However, Purnell said that she thought Hall \xe2\x80\x98felt embarrassed\xe2\x80\x99 when people wanted to talk about what she did during the war. She wanted to remain undercover and went to work for the CIA. But she had a \xe2\x80\x98tough life\xe2\x80\x99 at the agency \xe2\x80\x98because she didn\xe2\x80\x99t conform to the 1950s kind of idea of the perfect women. She was almost embarrassing because she had done so much in the field behind enemy lines,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell said.
\xe2\x80\x98She took a lot of flak, but she took some ground as well and she made it possible for future generations to go further than she did.\xe2\x80\x99
Hall met her husband, then Lieutenant Paul Goillot, in 1944 during the war. They were married in 1957, and stayed together until her death on July 8, 1982 at aged 76.
\xe2\x80\x98Constantly throughout her life she was kind of dismissed as a woman of no importance,\xe2\x80\x99 Purnell said.
\xe2\x80\x98And yet, as we know, she ended up being a very important women indeed.\xe2\x80\x99
Virginia Hall, left, met her husband\xc2\xa0Paul Goillot, right, in 1944 in France.\xc2\xa0They were married in 1957, and stayed together until her death on July 8, 1982 at aged 76. Above, the couple in an undated photo when they were living in America. After the war, Hall worked for the CIA and the agency would fail, at times, to use her talents properly or promote her as they would a man \xe2\x80\x93 to the point that Hall became the agency\xe2\x80\x99s textbook example of discrimination, according to a new book \xe2\x80\x98A Woman of No Importance\'


Marco Verratti scored a rare goal for Paris Saint-Germain as they beat Nantes 3-0 at home to reach the French Cup final on Wednesday, with a fifth consecutive title in their sights.
The midfielder, who also found the net for Italy last week, opened the scoring for the Cup holders in the first half with his first PSG goal of the season.
Kylian Mbappe scored a penalty and Daniel Alves found the net with a delicate lob to wrap up victory in the closing stages.

Mbappe was denied from the spot by Nantes keeper Ciprian Tatarusanu earlier in the match before the visitors were reduced to 10 men after Kalifa Coulibaly was sent off for a second yellow card in the 71st minute.
PSG, who lost Marquinhos to a muscle injury, will face Stade Rennais, who beat Olympique Lyonnais 3-2 on Tuesday, in the April 27 showdown at the Stade de France.
The Ligue 1 leaders have not conceded a single goal on their way to the final.
With Neymar watching from the stands, Verratti unleashed a low diagonal shot from outside the box on 29 minutes to put the home side ahead.
It was his second goal in eight days after he scored in Italy\'s 6-0 victory over Liechtenstein in a Euro 2020 qualifier last Tuesday.
Mbappe beat Tatarusanu from the penalty spot after a Nicolas Pallois handball, but referee Francois Letexier had it retaken due to players encroaching into the box.
Tatarusanu blocked the second attempt, but he was powerless with Mbappe\'s penalty in the 83rd minute after Alves was brought down by Diego Carlos.
Alves wrapped up an emphatic win when he lobbed Tatarusanu from the edge of the box two minutes into added time.
The sides will meet again at the Parc des Princes in Ligue 1 in two weeks.

PARIS, April 2 (Reuters) - Marine Le Pen, the leader of France\'s far-right party, said on Tuesday she would raise funds from the public for next month\'s European Parliament elections, after her party failed to secure a multi-million-euro bank loan.
Nationalist, eurosceptic and anti-immigration parties are expected to make strong gains in the vote, and Le Pen\'s Rassemblement National (National Rally) is almost neck-and-neck in the polls with President Emmanuel Macron\'s En Marche.
The RN, which changed its name from Front National to shed a brand associated by many voters with racism and anti-Semitism, faces financial problems: it is heavily indebted and has had its accounts in France closed by banks which declined to say why.
It also remains dogged by questions over a Russian loan that helped financed Le Pen\'s 2017 presidential run.
"We have no other option than to go to the French people and ask to borrow money for a year to wage our campaign," Le Pen told LCI news site.
The party had been hoping to secure a 4 million euro ($4.5 million) loan, Jordan Bardella, the lead candidate on Le Pen\'s list for the European election, told Reuters in January.
But that was unsuccessful and the party now hopes to raise cash through loans or donations from supporters, Le Pen said.
The RN\'s cash-crunch could hamper its ability to mount a national campaign and win support beyond Le Pen\'s core base. Voters often use European Parliament elections to express discontent with the government.
After Macron reshaped France\'s political landscape with his 2017 election victory, obliterating the traditional centre-right and centre-left blocks that dominated politics for decades, the European contest is shaping up as a showdown between Macron\'s and Le Pen\'s parties.
An Ifop-Fiducial survey this week showed Macron\'s La Republique en Marche on 22.5 percent compared with 21 percent for Le Pen\'s party.
The RN is not alone in seeking public financial support. On Sunday, the hard-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed) said it had raised 300,000 euros in the first few hours of launching a crowdfunding appeal.

PARIS, April 2 (Reuters) - All preparations have been made to protect Europe\'s financial sector in case Britain leaves the European Union without a Brexit divorce deal, said Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau on Tuesday.
British lawmakers failed on Monday to resolve chaos around Britain\'s EU departure, leaving the future direction of Brexit mired in confusion.
"We have made all preparations at the European and national levels, including in case of a no-deal exit, to ensure that contracts continue to be honored and financial sector clients are protected," Villeroy said on France Inter radio. (Reporting by Leigh Thomas; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta)


US President Donald Trump says he\'ll be attending Normandy 75th anniversary ceremonies at a meeting with WWII veterans and their families in the Oval Office
US President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will attend ceremonies to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy that broke Nazi Germany\'s grip on France.
"I\'ll be there," he told reporters in the White House.
Operation Overlord was launched on June 6, 1944, sending waves of US and other Allied soldiers onto the French coast where they dislodged German forces and began the liberation of France and the eventual battle for Germany itself, ending in defeat for the Nazis.
The Normandy trip will add to a relatively busy summer of international travel for Trump, who is also expected to go to Japan twice and to a G7 summit in August in Biarritz, France.


PARIS, April 8 (Reuters) - Air France KLM, which has been the subject of political tensions between France and the Netherlands, on Monday reported a rise in its March passenger numbers compared with the previous year.
The airline said it carried a total of 8.3 million passengers in March, up 3.4 percent from a year earlier.
However, Air France KLM\'s March passenger load factor - an industry metric that measures how much of an airline\'s passenger carrying capacity is used - dropped by 0.3 percentage points to 87.6 percent.
In February, the Netherlands quietly amassed a 14 percent stake in Air France KLM, almost matching the 14.3 percent held by the French state.
The move triggered a diplomatic spat between France and the Netherlands, although both countries have since sought to play down those tensions. (Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips)

TRIPOLI/ROME, April 11 (Reuters) - France and Italy wrangled on Thursday over how best to tackle renewed conflict in Libya as a bid by eastern forces under Khalifa Haftar to seize Tripoli stalled in the face of strong resistance on the capital\'s southern outskirts.
The United Nations said the fighting between Haftar\'s forces and troops under the internationally-backed Tripoli government had killed at least 56 people and forced 8,000 to flee their homes in the city in the last week.
A Reuters reporter heard occasional heavy gunfire and explosions as the eastern Libyan National Army (LNA) faced off with forces of Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj\'s government around the ex-international airport and the Ain Zara district.
Officials brought families displaced by fighting on Tripoli\'s southern fringes to area schools. Red Crescent workers were heading out rations in one school as gunfire clattered in the distance.
Haftar\'s push on Tripoli in Libya\'s northwest is the latest turn in a cycle of factional violence and chaos in Libya dating to the 2011 uprising that overthrew veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi.
After sweeping up from the south, LNA bogged down in Tripoli\'s southern suburbs 11 km (7 miles) from the city centre.
In Rome, Libya\'s former colonial ruler Italy warned France, which has good relations with Haftar, to refrain from supporting any one faction after diplomats said Paris had scuttled a European Union statement calling on him to halt his offensive.
"It would be very serious if France for economic or commercial reasons had blocked an EU initiative to bring peace to Libya and would support a party that is fighting," Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini told Radio RTL 102.5.
"As minister of the interior I will not stand by and watch."
France, which has oil assets in eastern Libya, has provided military assistance in past years to Haftar in his eastern stronghold, Libyan and French officials say. It was also a leading player in the war to unseat Gaddafi..
Italy supports the U.N.-backed government of Serraj.
ITALY SPARS WITH FRANCE
"Some think that the (2011 Nato-led military intervention) in Libya promoted by (then-French President Nicolas) Sarkozy was triggered more by economic and commercial interests than by humanitarian concerns," Salvini said.
"I hope we are not seeing the same film all over again."
An EU draft statement on Wednesday said Haftar\'s attack on Tripoli put civilians at risk, disrupted normalisation efforts and risked an escalation with serious consequences for Libya and the wider region. That statement was sidelined by France .
French diplomatic sources said Paris did not object to calls on Haftar to halt his advance, but rather had only requested amendments including mentions of the plight of migrants in Libya and the presence in anti-Haftar forces of Islamist militants designated as terrorists by the United Nations.
The latest tally of casualties from the U.N. World Health Organization (WHO) said 56 people - mainly combatants though also some civilians including two doctors and an ambulance driver - had been killed, and another 266 wounded in Tripoli.
In addition, 28 LNA soldiers had been killed and 92 wounded since the start of the offensive a week ago, according to the LNA.
The number of people forced out of their homes by fighting rose to 8,075, the U.N. migration agency IOM said.
As well as the humanitarian consequences, renewed conflict in Libya threatens to disrupt oil supplies, increase migration across the Mediterranean to Europe, scupper the U.N. peace plan for the country and encourage militants to exploit the chaos. Libya is a main transit point for migrants who have poured into Europe in recent years, mostly by trafficking gangs.
The LNA forces swept out of their stronghold in eastern Libya to take the sparsely populated but oil-rich south earlier this year, before heading towards Tripoli, where Serraj\'s U.N.-backed government sits.
Haftar was among the officers who helped Gaddafi seize power in a 1969 coup before parting ways with him later. But critics call Haftar another strongman in Gaddafi\'s mould.
Haftar has resisted U.N. pressure to accept a power-sharing settlement to stabilise the country, using his leverage as a Western ally against militant Islam in North Africa. (Additional reporting by Ahmed Elumami in Tripoli, Tom Miles in Geneva and John Irish in Paris Editing by Mark Heinrich)

The 12 Camargue horses were seen running through the water as the sun set behind them.
They sent water splashing into the air while speeding through the lake near the French town of Sainte Marie de La Mer, near Montpellier, France.

LUXEMBOURG, April 9 (Reuters) - France and Germany expressed concern over the independence of Polish courts at a meeting of European Union ministers on Tuesday, keeping up pressure on Warsaw to drop changes to the judiciary that the EU believes undermine the separation of powers.
Last week, the European Commission launched an infringement procedure against Poland over a new disciplinary system for judges, which the Commission argues is meant to scare them into sentencing in line with the wishes of the ruling euro-sceptic and nationalist PiS party.
"We hope that the infringement procedure launched by the European Commission last week regarding the new disciplinary regime for judges will allow some improvements, in particular regarding the right to an effective remedy before an independent and impartial court," a Franco-German statement said.
The Commission, guardian of the EU treaties, has already opened two infringement procedures against Poland, in mid-2017 and in mid-2018, over changes to retirement provisions for Polish judges and the possible impact on their independence.
Poland is also already subject to an unprecedented EU rule-of-law procedure, called Article 7 from the article of the EU treaty it is based on, since 2017 over judiciary reforms.
The process could in theory result in Poland losing its EU voting rights, though this is unlikely because all other 27 EU member states would have to agree. Hungary, also under the same procedure, has vowed to veto such a move.
"We want to seize the opportunity ... to stress, once again, our concerns regarding the overall situation created by the reform of the judiciary system in Poland," the joint statement said.
"In our view, the combined effect of the legislative changes could put at risk the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers in Poland," it said.
Paris and Berlin said concerns over the rule of law in Poland that led to the launch of the Article 7 procedure had not been completely and properly addressed.
"We reaffirm our support to the Commission in this regard... In view of the recent developments, we propose to hold a new session of the hearing of Poland after the European elections ... in June." (Reporting by Jan Strupczewski Editing by Giles Elgood)


ZURICH (AP) - Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

Francesco Molinari may view himself as \'no spring chicken\' but the Open champion hopes to use a few old tricks to contend for a second major title in the 83rd Masters.
Molinari\'s best finish at Augusta National was a tie for 19th in 2012 but the Italian comes into the event on the back of a stellar 12 months.
The 36-year-old has won four times since last year\'s Masters, including the Open Championship at Carnoustie, while he also became the first European player to earn a perfect 5-0 record in the Ryder Cup in Paris.
Francesco Molinari pictured in action during a practice round at Augusta ahead of the Masters
\'What has let me down in the past here is on and around the greens,\' Molinari said.
\'It\'s a very tough test because of the speed and undulations, so I hope to show the progress I\'ve made in the last few months and get a good performance in this week.
\'I can see some things now I\'ve improved in the putting that I wasn\'t doing well in the past that would be costly around here.
\'It\'s a course most guys need to play a few times to learn a few tricks. Hopefully, I can use the experience from the last few years this week.
Molinari won last year\'s Open Championship and has been in excellent form over the last year
\'There\'s been a lot of work going on in the last few years and sometimes it doesn\'t pay off straight away. It\'s taken a while, but obviously, now success is coming quite often and that\'s a nice feeling.
\'So I\'ll try to keep working to keep the success coming and win as many tournaments as I can. You know, I\'m not a spring chicken anymore, so I need to make the most of it.\'
Molinari\'s first experience of Augusta National was as a caddie for his brother in 2006 after Edoardo qualified by virtue of winning the US Amateur title the year before.
\'I carried the clubs and prayed that he was going to hit good shots,\' Molinari said of the experience.
Molinari plays a shot from the sand on Monday as he gears up for the start of the Masters
\'It was a fun week. I think I got here after missing a cut on the European Tour (in the Algarve Open de Portugal) and just got the full caddie experience.
\'It was great to be here. It wasn\'t fun trying to pick clubs for him. It\'s a tough course to caddie around.
\'You know, when you stand on the 12th tee, you just hope to make the right decision but it\'s really not easy, especially where we both were at the time.
\'We were very inexperienced at this level and just trying to make the most of those two days, to be honest.\'

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."
___
9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.
___
8:45 a.m.
A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.


Former France midfielder Florent Malouda fired on Twitter

ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.

The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.
"The key for us is to remain grouped together," Macron said. "We have a European renaissance to lead. We don\'t want the Brexit problem to block us on this point."
In the end, the EU leaders hammered out a compromise — giving May more time than Macron wanted to give her to steer a departure deal through her country\'s bitterly divided parliament, while simultaneously shaving months off Tusk\'s suggestion.
As Wednesday night ebbed into the wee hours of Thursday, Macron stood his ground, insisting on a shorter delay than Tusk and most other EU nations wanted. May had requested pushing the Brexit deadline back to June 30, but did not object to a longer delay.
Leaders ultimately coalesced around Oct. 31 — Halloween — as the latest Brexit deadline, averting a potentially disruptive no-deal British departure that would have happened Friday if no extension had been agreed.
"We had a very intensive debate," was how German Chancellor Angela Merkel characterized the summit.
Hanging tough in Brussels could also pay domestic political dividends for Macron, projecting strength at a time when he is weakened by yellow vest protesters at home.
"There seem to be those who think it is good politics for Macron at home to stand up to the British," said Anand Menon, professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at Kings College London and Director of the UK in a Changing Europe Initiative. "One of the things that certainly seems to have happened is that he annoyed a lot of people in Brussels last night by what many saw as his unnecessary theatrics."
A senior EU official at the talks acknowledged that it was "a difficult moment" but said the atmosphere remained constructive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the talks.
While May now has until Oct. 31 to find backing for her unloved Brexit withdrawal deal, Britain could still leave earlier if talks with the country\'s opposition Labour Party find a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament.
"I continue to believe we need to leave the EU, with a deal, as soon as possible," May told reporters.
Manfred Weber, a German who leads the biggest group in the European Parliament, said Europe showed "patience and unity" in avoiding a damaging no-deal Brexit. But he added that "the political uncertainty in London has been extended, which risks affecting debates about the future of Europe."
Germany\'s Spiegel Online called the early-morning agreement a "classic Brussels compromise."
"The EU retained its unity on Brexit — albeit only just," it said.
The British press compared the latest Brexit machinations to Wednesday\'s other big news — the publication of the first-ever photograph of a black hole.
"Here\'s another inescapable black hole," The Times wrote under the photo, referencing Britain\'s Brexit impasse.

PARIS (AP) — The beIN Sports television network and commentator Daniel Bravo have apologized after Bravo described Strasbourg striker Nuno Da Costa\'s statistics as "not bad for a black."
Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.

France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."


UK, US, and France warn Syria not to use chemical weapons

WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.

EDF\'s Board of Directors held on 4 April, decided to convene a Combined Shareholders Meeting, which will meet on 16 May at 10:00 in the morning, in the Pleyel room, and decided on the draft resolutions that will be submitted for approval to the Shareholders Meeting.
This Shareholders Meeting is called, among other things, to decide on the appointment and renewal of directors\' mandates, as well as on the implementation of the staggered renewal of the Board.
The Board of Directors decided to propose to the Shareholders Meeting:
To renew Mr Jean-Bernard Lévy\'s mandate as director for a four-year term which will come to an end at the close of the ordinary shareholders meeting convened to approve the accounts for the year ending on 31 December 2022;
To renew the mandates of Mrs Marie-Christine Lepetit, Mrs Colette Lewiner, Mrs Laurence Parisot, Mrs Michèle Rousseau and Mr Maurice Gourdault-Montagne as directors for a two-year term which will come to an end at the close of the ordinary shareholders meeting convened to approve the accounts for the year ending on 31 December 2020;
To appoint Mrs Anne Rigail, Mr Bruno Crémel, Mr Gilles Denoyel and Mr Philippe Petitcolin as directors for a four-year term which will come to an end at the close of the ordinary shareholders meeting convened to approve the accounts for the year ending on 31 December 2022.
Mrs Lepetit, Mrs Rigail, Mrs Rousseau, Mr Denoyel and Mr Gourdault-Montagne would be appointed on French State\'s proposal, in accordance with article 6.II of the ruling of 20 August 2014.
If the corresponding resolutions are approved by the Shareholders Meeting, the Board will have at the end of the General Meeting on 16 May five directors qualified as independent according to the criteria stipulated by the AFEP-MEDEF corporate governance code, so a proportion of 41.7%, and eight women, so a proportion of 50%, in relation to the members of the Board taken into account to carry out this calculation (excluding directors representing employees).
On their departure from EDF\'s Board of Directors, the Chairman and CEO and members of the Board were keen to acknowledge the commitment of Messrs Appert, Crouzet, Lafont and Léchevin, who have helped the company over many years, and thanked them for their critical contributions to the success enjoyed by EDF in an era marked by deep changes.


"France does not want a trade war or tension with the United States", added the source, who declined to be named, adding that it was likely France would be the only party to oppose opening the talks.
European Union countries gave initial clearance on Thursday to start formal trade talks with the United States, EU sources said, a move designed but not guaranteed to smooth strained relations between the world\'s two largest economies.
The French move does not block opening of the trade negotiations because the necessary majority of EU member states backs it.
"What we\'re saying is we aren\'t going to reward the United States in this context," the official said, referring to threats in recent days to take action over the pricing of European Airbus airliners.
"We have never believed in the idea of showing weakness to win favours from (President Donald) Trump, so the idea that we can improve our situation through concessions by giving into pressure is not a good one," the official said.

Of the 304 companies assessed by the Great Place to Work® teams this year, 97 have been included in the list of French companies \'where it\'s good to work\'. Wavestone once again sits in the Top 5 of this ranking, with 82% of employees considering the firm a Great Place to Work®.
Wavestone\'s application for the Great Place to Work© ranking leverages its ambition to be a benchmark employer over the long-term. As Cécile Trinquier, Domain HR Manager at Wavestone explains, \'the job market in general, and particularly in the consulting sector, is fiercely competitive: talented people, highly sought after, are increasingly demanding in terms of their working environment and the content of their missions. Turnover is a reality and something we experience and take into account on a daily basis. In response to this situation, Great Place to Work® is a valuable tool for enhancing our HR policy by mobilizing teams in the most effective and appropriate way possible.\'
Promoting an original identity in the consulting sector
With over 700 new hires per year, the successful integration of newcomers is key: how can we ensure that each employee finds their place and embodies the firm\'s values? From the recruitment phase, Wavestone invites candidates to see themselves as being a part of the firm\'s corporate culture, through events such as Wavestone Connect (see annex below). Wavestone Inside, the seminar dedicated to new employees, in the presence of the management team (see annex below), is another crucial step in sharing the Wavestone mindset.
On a daily basis, managers are responsible for the employee experience at Wavestone. The 18th edition of the Cadremploi/Ifop barometer on managers\' expectations reveals that \'54% of managers believe that their employer has not implemented an action plan to effectively combat stress management and psychosocial risks\' (source: https://www.cadremploi.fr/editorial/actualites/actu-emploi/detail/article/18e-barometre-cadremploi-ifop-comment-les-cadres-ont-evolue-en-10-ans.html). With this in mind, Wavestone continuously trains mission managers and local managers (see annex below: Career Development Managers or CDMs),
particularly to raise their awareness of the issue of psychosocial risks. The latest edition of Great Place To Work® has also led to the launch of an initiative that seeks to change the relationship between managers and employees: The Switch (see annex below).
Enabling progress while respecting work/life balance
Wavestone wants to give each employee the means to plan for a long-term professional future. To this end, the HR teams make Wavestone Horizon available to all: this is a reference framework, published on the intranet, that clearly outlines the skills, expertise and salary brackets associated with each rank. Individual performance is assessed annually on the basis of these common benchmarks. Everyone therefore has a clear idea of what they need to do to progress, both in terms of responsibilities and pay.
If the development of individual skills is valued, respect for personal life is even more important. Patrick Dumoulin, CEO of Great Place to Work® France, confirms: \'Wavestone combines social and economic performance more than ever. This is the result of a very employee-oriented strategy that makes Wavestone a real champion, capable of staying at the top of the Best Workplaces France ranking year after year.\' This work/life balance is particularly encouraged by measures facilitating parenting in companies, such as the subsidy of 85 crèche cradles in 2018 (+15% from 2017, making Wavestone one of Babilou\'s leading customers).
Encouraging entrepreneurial spirit and commitment
Wavestone is convinced that attracting the most talented employees and making them want to grow with the firm can only be achieved through their active participation in the firm\'s life. Co-construction is thus advocated at all levels. For example, CSR has been defined collaboratively within the firm; it is embodied in concrete terms through employees, particularly through skills sponsorship.
Regardless of their position or seniority, employees are encouraged to develop and promote their own projects. Recently, the new premises were redesigned at the initiative of a group of consultants who wanted the real needs of their profession - and the innovative practices they associate with it - to be better taken into account in the design of workspaces.
About the Great Place to Work® Institute
Since 1992 and across 50 countries, the Great Place to Work® Institute has been supporting companies by helping them to transform their working environment in a sustainable way through three areas: diagnosis (employee survey and analysis of managerial practices), consulting and training. Every year, it publishes the list of companies where it is good to work, in partnership with the Figaro Economie French newspaper supplement.

The U.S. Trade Representative on Monday proposed a list of EU products ranging from large commercial aircraft to dairy products and wine on which to impose tariffs as retaliation for European aircraft subsidies.
"The interest of our two countries, the interest of the United States and the European continent and France is to reach a friendly agreement," French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told a news conference in Paris.
"When I see the situation global growth is in, I don\'t think we can afford to have a trade conflict even if only on the specific issues of the aircraft industry in the United States and Europe," he added.

Electricite de France SA (EDF.FR) said Tuesday that it will begin producing low-carbon hydrogen under a new subsidiary called Hynamics.
The French energy company, which is 84% state-owned, said it aims to expand its foothold in the global hydrogen market, in response to strong projected demand growth for the fuel.
To produce hydrogen Hynamics will use water electrolysis, a technology that generates significantly less carbon dioxide than more common production methods based on fossil fuels, EDF said.
Hynamics will install and operate hydrogen plants for industrial customers, as well as hydrogen fuel stations to recharge commercial-vehicle fleets.
The company has already worked on 40 potential projects in France, Belgium, Germany and the U.K., it said.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."
___
9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.
___
8:45 a.m.
A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."


UK, US, and France warn Syria not to use chemical weapons

WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.

PARIS (AP) — The beIN Sports television network and commentator Daniel Bravo have apologized after Bravo described Strasbourg striker Nuno Da Costa\'s statistics as "not bad for a black."
Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.

France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.
"The key for us is to remain grouped together," Macron said. "We have a European renaissance to lead. We don\'t want the Brexit problem to block us on this point."
In the end, the EU leaders hammered out a compromise — giving May more time than Macron wanted to give her to steer a departure deal through her country\'s bitterly divided parliament, while simultaneously shaving months off Tusk\'s suggestion.
As Wednesday night ebbed into the wee hours of Thursday, Macron stood his ground, insisting on a shorter delay than Tusk and most other EU nations wanted. May had requested pushing the Brexit deadline back to June 30, but did not object to a longer delay.
Leaders ultimately coalesced around Oct. 31 — Halloween — as the latest Brexit deadline, averting a potentially disruptive no-deal British departure that would have happened Friday if no extension had been agreed.
"We had a very intensive debate," was how German Chancellor Angela Merkel characterized the summit.
Hanging tough in Brussels could also pay domestic political dividends for Macron, projecting strength at a time when he is weakened by yellow vest protesters at home.
"There seem to be those who think it is good politics for Macron at home to stand up to the British," said Anand Menon, professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at Kings College London and Director of the UK in a Changing Europe Initiative. "One of the things that certainly seems to have happened is that he annoyed a lot of people in Brussels last night by what many saw as his unnecessary theatrics."
A senior EU official at the talks acknowledged that it was "a difficult moment" but said the atmosphere remained constructive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the talks.
While May now has until Oct. 31 to find backing for her unloved Brexit withdrawal deal, Britain could still leave earlier if talks with the country\'s opposition Labour Party find a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament.
"I continue to believe we need to leave the EU, with a deal, as soon as possible," May told reporters.
Manfred Weber, a German who leads the biggest group in the European Parliament, said Europe showed "patience and unity" in avoiding a damaging no-deal Brexit. But he added that "the political uncertainty in London has been extended, which risks affecting debates about the future of Europe."
Germany\'s Spiegel Online called the early-morning agreement a "classic Brussels compromise."
"The EU retained its unity on Brexit — albeit only just," it said.
The British press compared the latest Brexit machinations to Wednesday\'s other big news — the publication of the first-ever photograph of a black hole.
"Here\'s another inescapable black hole," The Times wrote under the photo, referencing Britain\'s Brexit impasse.

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.

ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
Sports Videos
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
10:15 a.m.
Julian Assange\'s mother has taken to Twitter to call on authorities to be gentle with her son, who\'s jailed in London after his removal from the Ecuadorian Embassy.
Christine Assange\'s tweets on Friday say Assange had been deprived of fresh air, exercise and medical care. "Please be patient, gentle & kind to him" she asked of police and court personnel.
The WikiLeaks founder is an Australia native, and the government said he would receive consular help due to its citizens after he was arrested on a U.S. conspiracy charge. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the expected battle over Assange\'s possible extradition would not involve Australia.
___
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.

\t\tQUALIFIERS REVIEW 3: The record world champions France were without a chance in Guimaraes, though they played with their top team\r

\tThe next sensation: Portugal demolish France

\t\t\r
\t\t\r
\r
\t\r
\t\t\r
\r
\tThe final match of Round 3 of EHF EURO 2020 Qualifiers saw the biggest surprise: One day after Montenegro beat current world and Olympic title holders Denmark, record world champions France were heavily defeated in Portugal.
\r
\r
\tPortugal are now on top of Group 6, two points ahead of France before the rematch on Sunday. Therefore, Portugal belong to a group of only four nations \xe2\x80\x93 alongside Hungary, Germany and Slovenia \xe2\x80\x93 to have the maximum of six points from the first three qualification matches.
\r
\r
\tGROUP 6
\r
\tPortugal vs France 33:27 (17:13)
\r
\r
\tIt was back in 1980, in Torshavn, when a Portugal men\xe2\x80\x99s team recorded their only victory ever against France. On Thursday night, more than 39 years later, history was finally repeated. And while in 1980, France were anything but a top side in international handball, now they are six-time world champions, three-time EHF EURO champions, twice Olympic champions, and bronze medallists at the last two major tournaments: the EHF EURO 2018 and the 2019 World Championship.
\r
\r
\tIn this context, Portugal\xe2\x80\x99s victory is truly sensational \xe2\x80\x93 but fully deserved. For France, it was the biggest defeat ever in any EHF EURO qualification match. Previously, the record was the 30:35 result against Norway on the way to the EHF EURO 2018.
\r
\t \r
\t\tWow, what an incredible match for @andebolportugal \xf0\x9f\x87\xb5\xf0\x9f\x87\xb9. A 33:27 victory against @frahandball \xf0\x9f\x87\xab\xf0\x9f\x87\xb7 gives them a great chance of qualifying for #ehfeuro2020. pic.twitter.com/0omabIZw4Y \r

\r
\r
\r
\tFrance were shocked by an initial 0:3 deficit, then got back on track, but never managed to take the lead in the whole 60 minutes. The 12:12 in minute 23 was the last levelled result, before Portugal overran the French side.
\r
\r
\tThanks to outstanding defence, the biggest gap was eight goals at 26:18. Even the Portuguese fans in the stands could not believe what they saw. And the hosts continued the same way until the end, even scoring in a numerical deficit situation against one of the best defences in the world of handball.
\r
\r
\tSince 2006, Portugal had not qualified for any EHF EURO final tournament. Now, they are almost through, having in mind that, besides the eight group winners and runners-up, the four best third-ranked teams will be in the pots for the draw event on 28 June in Vienna.

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.


France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."
___
9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.
___
8:45 a.m.
A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."

PARIS (AP) — The beIN Sports television network and commentator Daniel Bravo have apologized after Bravo described Strasbourg striker Nuno Da Costa\'s statistics as "not bad for a black."
Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.
\r

Da Costa wrote: "No worries, a tongue slip happens, he works too much. beIN SPORTS, stop mid-week games please."

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.

Former France midfielder Florent Malouda fired on Twitter

\r
\t\r
ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
\r
\r
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Britain, France and the United States are warning the Syria against using chemical weapons on opponents of the government.
The foreign ministers of the three countries say in a joint statement that Syria\'s past use of such weapons "cannot be disputed."
They say they will "act strongly and swiftly" in the event of any future attack.
The statement was released ahead of the two- and three-year anniversaries of chemical weapons attacks in Syria for which the three nations vow to hold the perpetrators to account. They also renewed demands for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Syria.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons against opponents. International investigators have confirmed that the weapons have been used but stopped short of accusing specific perpetrators.

PARIS (AP) — The French government wants to impose a cap on executives\' pension packages, amid criticism of a hefty retirement deal for the CEO of Airbus.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday on BFM television that he will propose legislation in coming weeks to limit pension packages to 30 percent of an executive\'s annual pay. He didn\'t elaborate.
Le Maire has said the package for Airbus\' Tom Enders was "excessive" and could hurt the plane maker\'s reputation. French media reports based on analyst calculations said Enders was getting a retirement package worth 36 million euros. Airbus isn\'t commenting on the amount.
Le Maire\'s promise came as France continues to see weekly yellow vest protests by those who decry the struggles of low-paid workers and pensioners and accuse President Emmanuel Macron\'s government of favoring the rich.

BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on Brexit discussions (all times local):
10 a.m.
A senior member of Theresa May\'s government says cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse over Britain\'s divorce from the European Union are moving forward in a "genuine and sincere" way.
Justice Secretary David Gauke told the BBC that it\'s too early to say whether the talks between the government and opposition Labour Party will be successful but work is continuing to identify a compromise, two days before EU leaders decide whether to grant a further extension to the Brexit process.
If they refuse, Britain faces a sudden and chaotic departure on Friday, the current deadline set by the EU.
Gauke says people involved in the cross-party talks "are telling me that the process is being undertaken in a genuine and sincere way from both sides."
___
9:45 a.m.
France is vowing that the 27 EU nations facing the United Kingdom in Brexit divorce proceedings will remain united at Wednesday\'s summit, where they need to agree whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May another deadline extension.
French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said early Tuesday that the 27 will need commitments from May that the British government will continue to play a constructive role in EU decision-making if a long extension is to be granted.
"We have the question what role Britain wants to play" if a long extension of the deadline is granted, possibly to the end of the year. In Britain, some have threatened that the government should seek to undermine EU policymaking as a way to get more leverage for the U.K.
___
8:45 a.m.
A senior German official is demanding "substantial steps" forward in Britain\'s Brexit standoff and insisting any delay must come with strict conditions, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to plead for more time in Berlin.
Michael Roth, Germany\'s deputy foreign minister, said as he arrived at a European Union meeting in Luxembourg Tuesday that "so far absolutely nothing has changed" and "we are in a very, very frustrating situation here."
May has asked for a new delay until June 30. The bloc\'s leaders are due to meet Wednesday to consider the request. May is visiting Berlin and Paris later Tuesday.
Roth said that "within the European Union, there isn\'t an endless readiness to keep talking about delays so long as there is no substantial progress on the British side."

PARIS (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line interior minister and France\'s far-right leader are cementing their longtime alliance ahead of Europe-wide elections next month and said they will press for like-minded candidates in Europe to join their "family."
Matteo Salvini and Marine Le Pen discussed work, family and environmental protection as major themes in the upcoming vote, which will determine the makeup of the European Parliament in Brussels, Salvini\'s office said.
They met on Friday in Paris ahead of the G-7 meeting of interior ministers. Both Le Pen\'s National Rally party and Salvini\'s League have railed against the power wielded by the European Union\'s governing body, especially when it comes to immigration.
Both parties — as well as others on Europe\'s right — could make gains in the late May elections, according to recent polling.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\'s arrest (all times local):
10:15 a.m.
Julian Assange\'s mother has taken to Twitter to call on authorities to be gentle with her son, who\'s jailed in London after his removal from the Ecuadorian Embassy.
Christine Assange\'s tweets on Friday say Assange had been deprived of fresh air, exercise and medical care. "Please be patient, gentle & kind to him" she asked of police and court personnel.
The WikiLeaks founder is an Australia native, and the government said he would receive consular help due to its citizens after he was arrested on a U.S. conspiracy charge. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the expected battle over Assange\'s possible extradition would not involve Australia.
___
9:45 a.m.
France\'s government says it won\'t consider offering Julian Assange political asylum unless he asks for it.
Assange\'s French lawyer has appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to intervene to bring the WikiLeaks founder from a London jail to France and help him avoid extradition to the United States.
Lawyer Juan Branco told The Associated Press on Thursday that Macron should offer mediation and to "take this man under our protection." He said Assange has a small child in France.
France\'s secretary of state for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Friday on France-Inter radio that while Europe has special measures to protect whistleblowers, France hasn\'t received a formal request from Assange. She said "we should listen to what he wants to do" but "we don\'t offer asylum to someone who\'s not asking for it."
Macron hasn\'t commented publicly.
Assange was arrested Thursday in London and faces U.S. charges related to WikiLeaks\' publication of tens of thousands of classified government documents.
___
9 a.m.
The leader of Britain\'s opposition Labour Party says the government should oppose the extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet that the U.S. is trying to extradite Assange because he exposed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan."
Diane Abbott, Labour\'s spokeswoman for domestic affairs, told the BBC on Friday that the government should block the extradition on human rights grounds. Assange was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.
Abbott says the U.S. case against Assange is about the "embarrassment of the things he\'s revealed about the American military and security services."
She says Assange is "a whistleblower, and much of the information that he brought into the public domain, it could be argued, was very much in the public interest."


Former France midfielder Florent Malouda fired on Twitter
ZURICH (AP) — Former France midfielder Florent Malouda has learned via Twitter that he was fired by Swiss soccer club FC Zurich.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
Malouda wrote "really I didn\'t know that..??" after Zurich\'s announcement was posted.
The 38-year-old Frenchman, who helped Chelsea win the Champions League title in 2012 and played in the 2006 World Cup final loss to Italy, had coached Zurich\'s forwards since February.
It\'s not Malouda\'s first setback in Switzerland. Last year, he lost a Court of Arbitration for Sport appeal against French Guiana forfeiting a 2017 Gold Cup game because he played while ineligible.
The French Guiana soccer federation had hoped Malouda, who was born in the South American territory, could switch allegiance from France because it is not a FIFA member.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Netflix show "Queer Eye " caught on by doing something unusual: creating reality TV that touches on some of the country\'s deepest divides with persistent optimism.
Alongside sleek new haircuts and rehabbed wardrobes, the makeover program starring five gay men tackles the contrast between urban and rural, white and black, liberal and conservative.
The show\'s resident fashion expert, Tan France , switches between those worlds off-camera too. He\'s an English immigrant who was raised Muslim and spends his off hours at home with his husband in decidedly red-state Utah. Living in Salt Lake City gives him a perspective that comes in handy for a show featuring a cross-section of America, he says.
"When I go into the homes of these people, they\'re my neighbors. I spend my days with them. I know who these people are, so it puts me in a very privileged position to say, \'I get what you\'re going through, and let me help you through it,\'" he said in a recent interview at his renovated historic home on a quiet street.
The house\'s attic floor is given entirely to a walk-in closet and another closet for scented candles. It\'s the kind of stylish wholesomeness the show channels effectively.
A reboot of the 2003 series "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," the version that premiered last year takes the setup to new places. The makeover subjects, dubbed heroes on the show, have ranged from a President Trump-supporting NASCAR fan to two African-American sisters who own a barbecue joint. Between the home renovations and cooking lessons are plenty of poignant moments.
France stars on the show along with food guru Antoni Porowski, hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness, culture expert Karamo Brown and home designer Bobby Berk.
"It\'s a very honest, earnest show," France said. "I think many people worried that this wasn\'t going to work. It was going to be a very emotional show, it was going to be a positive show, and up until that point those shows weren\'t successful."
But "Queer Eye" quickly took off, has now released a third season and won best reality show at the GLAAD media awards. Rich Ferraro, a spokesman for the LGBTQ advocacy group, said the original show helped raise awareness by bringing five successful gay men into American living rooms across the country. The new version also includes some subjects from the LGBTQ community, from a transgender man to a black lesbian disowned by her adoptive family.
"I love how the \'Queer Eye\' of today shows not only the evolution of the subject but of the people who live in the neighborhoods and communities around the subject and how they come to terms with LGBTQ people," Ferraro said. "I think \'Queer Eye\' has become a moment of celebration during a pretty dark time for LGBTQ Americans."
Skylar Jay, a transgender man from Athens, Georgia, who uses his first and middle name publicly for safety reasons, said he\'s gotten far more reaction than he expected after he appeared as a subject on the show.
"Everyone watches this show!" he said. Most surprising has been the reaction of straight, cisgender men. While those kinds of encounters with strangers might have included name-calling or violence in the past, now many men want to shake his hand or say thanks for educating them about transgender issues.
In one episode, Jay has a long conversation about transgender issues with France, who said he knew few transgender people and asked a number of questions. Jay said he still hears from people all over the world about that talk.
"People who are trans, or have someone trans in their family or a trans friend, or who don\'t even know anyone who\'s trans at all but now they have at least somewhat of an understanding to be decent to trans people," he said. "That is the most valuable gift they gave me."
France, meanwhile, has become a rare LGBTQ celebrity of south Asian descent. A native of the north of England whose family is Pakistani, he has lived in Salt Lake City on and off for more than a decade. It\'s where he met his husband, Rob, an illustrator who grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wyoming. Though they don\'t talk much about faith, France said their different upbringings nevertheless created a similar value system.
France also loves the sweeping mountain vistas that surround the city, the burgeoning food scene and longtime friends.
"If I lived in New York or L.A., I\'m sure my life would have changed massively. That\'s why I choose to live in Salt Lake," he said. "I come home and escape from the extra life I have no desire to live."
He\'d also like to correct some misperceptions: Salt Lake isn\'t full of polygamists, and in fact the predominant faith renounced it more than a century ago. Though the church has sometimes been at odds with the larger LGBTQ community, France has many friends who belong to the faith and hasn\'t faced discrimination in Utah.
He wasn\'t in entertainment before, instead designing fashionable, modest clothing in Utah and building a partnership with a successful blogger who considered a reality TV show. That project didn\'t pan out, but it got France noticed by casting directors and led to an offer to do "Queer Eye" — one that came days after he sold his businesses so to start a family.
Kids are on hold for now as he tours with the cast and prepares for the June release of his memoir, "Naturally Tan." France, 35, says he knew his life was different the day that Jon Bon Jovi asked for a selfie with him. He gets plenty of questions about his distinctive silver hair, which started going gray at age 17.
"I will not dye it. I have no desire to dye it," he said. Instead, he styles his naturally curly tresses into a tall blow-out.
Like other members of the cast, he\'s developed a matter-of-fact but kind manner over the years, one that helps keep the show from veering into mockery.
"I don\'t go in with judgment," he said. "It\'s never a case of, \'We know what\'s best and this isn\'t the right life for you.\' We find what we think would be the best version of them and we create it."

BRUSSELS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron\'s drive for a swift end to the European Union\'s long-running, slow-moving Brexit crisis divided a summit that finally granted Britain another delay in leaving the bloc.
Over a dinner of scallops and cod, 27 European leaders wrangled between a long-game strategy, favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, to give Britain up to a year to figure out how to leave the EU and Macron\'s desire to put pressure on British Prime Minister Theresa May by keeping any delay short.
Macron was happy to play hard ball to ensure that Britain doesn\'t disrupt the EU on its way out the door. Some pro-Brexit lawmakers have suggested they could make trouble for the bloc if they stay.

PARIS (AP) — The world\'s security challenges are at the top of the agenda of foreign and interior ministers of the Group of Seven countries who are gathering in France.
Interior ministers in Paris are focusing Friday on environmental crime, including reckless deforestation, waste trafficking and protection of lands and wildlife.
They will then detail joint commitments on fighting terrorism and human trafficking in a news conference.
Meanwhile, foreign ministers will kick off their two-day meeting in the Atlantic resort of Dinard. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stayed at home because of domestic duties. Washington sent lower-ranking officials instead.
In addition to the U.S., the G-7 includes France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.


Former France player apologizes for racist remark on TV

Bravo, a former Paris Saint-Germain defensive midfielder who also played for France\'s national team, made his remark during Strasbourg\'s 4-0 win over Reims in the French league on Wednesday. Da Costa scored two of the goals.
The network says Bravo\'s remarks "are counter to the values advocated by the channel and its editorial team."
Da Costa later posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Bravo clasping hands.
Da Costa wrote: "No worries, a tongue slip happens, he works too much. beIN SPORTS, stop mid-week games please."

France and Germany launch alliance to back multilateralism
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Germany have announced the launch of an Alliance for Multilateralism to promote global cooperation at a time of rising nationalism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
France\'s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a joint news conference with Germany\'s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday that their first objective is to show that states that "support multilateralism and support the United Nations remain the majority in the world."
The second objective, he said, is to create a network of countries ready to support multilateralism and cooperate, including to fight inequality, tackle climate change and address the consequences of new technologies.
Le Drian said the alliance also wants "to show the world what could be the consequences of unilateralism and isolationism enabling nationalism and extremist speeches to flourish."
He said the alliance is a response to the risk of shattering the post-World War II world order that established the United Nations and other international institutions.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres opened last September\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly declaring that global cooperation is the world\'s best hope and warning that "multilateralism is under fire precisely when we need it most."
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s speech, soon after Guterres.\' poured scorn on multilateralism, touted his "America First" policy, and rejected "the ideology of globalism."
Nonetheless, General Assembly President Maria Espinosa Garces said at the end of the week-long meeting during which all 193 U.N. member nations spoke that one of its major achievements was strong global backing for the U.N. and multilateralism.
Le Drian said cooperation is never easy but it is key to security "because there is security only if it is collective, and it is the best guarantee for long-lasting peace."
He said France and Germany will pursue the initiative in the coming months and try to convince as many countries as possible to join before leaders gather this September.
Le Drian noted that he and Maas discussed the alliance with Canada and Japan, but he made no mention of the United States.
Asked about possible support from the Trump administration, and whether it had been contacted, Le Drian said: "Whoever wants to join us can join us — It is against nobody."
Maas said he hasn\'t talked to Trump about it yet.
"This alliance is an inclusive alliance," he said. "So we don\'t want a situation where countries are left out. We don\'t lock out anyone. But, of course, we see multilateralism is under threat ... and all of those who want to join such an initiative (should) also declare themselves to be multilateralists."
"We would be happy, of course, if the United States were to join such an initiative, but this initiative has the aim to promote and strengthen the rules-based order and strengthen the international order," Maas said. "In the end, everyone will have to decide on which side they\'re on."

Five residents at a retirement home in southern France have died and around a dozen others are in a serious condition after a suspected case of mass food poisoning, officials said yesterday.
Twenty-two people at the privately operated Cheneraie residence in Lherm, a town south of Toulouse, began showing symptoms including vomiting after dinner on Sunday, police said in a statement.
Four deaths were initially announced by officials, and a source close to the inquiry later said that a fifth person had died.
About a dozen of the 82 residents at the site remain in serious condition.
The meals involved have been kept for analysis, the regional health agency said, and residents were being questioned about what they ate.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe suspect food poisoning because these events occurred after the meal,\xe2\x80\x9d said deputy prosecutor Marie-Paule Demiguel, adding the kitchens would also be investigated.
The home is run by private firm Korian, which claims to operate the largest network of retirement homes in Europe.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Monday announced plans to visit the United States, Canada and France this month before his country hosts the G20 later this year.
The tour from April 22 to 29 will also include stops in Italy, Belgium and Slovakia, a foreign ministry official said.
The trip comes ahead of long-awaited trade talks between Washington and Tokyo, as US President Donald Trump looks to negotiate a bilateral deal and threatens auto tariffs.
The visit to France comes at a sensitive time, with ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn, who holds French citizenship, back behind bars in Tokyo.
He was re-arrested last week while out on bail and faces multiple charges of financial misconduct.
Abe said the trip was intended to "affirm close co-operation for success in the G20 summit in Osaka", which will be held June 28 and 29.
Trump is also expected to visit Japan in May to become the first foreign head of state to meet Japan\'s new emperor, Naruhito, who will be enthroned on May 1.

\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t
Foreign ministers from the G7 group of rich nations implicitly warned eastern Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar on Friday against an advance towards the capital Tripoli as they scrambled to defuse a dangerous escalation in the north African oil producer\'s power struggle.
A military advance towards Tripoli and Libya\'s U.N.-backed government by Haftar has taken the United Nations and Western powers by surprise, just as its secretary general was in the capital to plan a peace conference this month.
The news intruded on an annual meeting bringing together the top diplomats from Britain, Canada, Germany, Italy, France, Japan and the United States, who had been negotiating on norms to tackle cyber interference in democracies and sexual violence in Africa.
"We firmly believe that there is no military solution to the Libyan conflict," the ministers said in a statement sent amid talks in western France.
"We strongly oppose any military action in Libya. Any Libyan actor or faction that precipitates further civil conflict are harming innocent people and standing in the way of the peace that Libyans deserve," the statement said, without naming Haftar directly.
The ministers said they backed U.N. efforts just hours after Secretary-General Antonio Guterres departed Libya following a meeting with Haftar to try to avert civil war.
Concern over Libya\'s stability is heightened by continuing political tensions around Europe over migration from north Africa, despite the fact that the numbers of new arrivals in Europe via the central Mediterranean have plummeted.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian had earlier welcomed his counterparts from the club of big, rich nations under a dull grey sky in Brittany, for a meeting already overshadowed by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\'s absence and Britain\'s Brexit meltdown.
French diplomats say Paris has scaled back its ambitions for France\'s presidency of the club of major industrialized countries after U.S. President Donald Trump threw last year\'s summit in Canada into disarray, backing out of a joint communique and firing barbs at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
A French diplomat sought to downplay Pompeo\'s snub saying: "We\'re working well with the Americans. Yes, we have differences on some subjects, but that isn\'t holding back the quality of our dialogue."
The ministers had aimed to agree on Friday on a code of conduct to tackle cyber interference in their democracies, but had turned their focus to Libya instead, diplomats said.
BREXIT LOOMS LARGE
Workers at dawn had furiously scrubbed away at graffiti spray-painted onto buildings near the secure zone in Dinard that attacked capitalism and President Emmanuel Macron.
The slogans screamed "Thieving banks", "Revolution" and "No to the G7", mirroring the anger vented across France in five months of anti-government "yellow vest" protests fuelled by perceptions of a growing rich-poor divide and aloof politicians.
The summit is expected to result in three joint statements on cyber security, sexual violence against women in armed conflict and trafficking in the Sahel region, and not too much wrangling over issues where there is less consensus such as Iran and Russia.
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he would use the summit to call on his European counterparts to support his government\'s request for a short delay to Britain\'s exit from the European Union.
British Prime Minister Theresa May wrote to Brussels on Friday asking for a delay of Brexit until up to June 30, while saying she aims to get Britain out of the EU earlier to avoid it participating in European elections.
"What we are looking for is to avoid a long extension," Hunt said. "We are a democracy with a hung parliament, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy."
Hunt said the G7 was proof Britain would not play a diminished international role after Brexit.
