Germany mulls new rules to boost organ donations
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s health minister on Monday launched a drive to tackle a shortage of donor organs with a reform that would make most people potential organ donors unless they object.

\r
\t\r
At present, doctors in Germany can transplant organs only from people who actively declare their willingness, for example by carrying a donor card or making a living will. Around 2,000 people in the country of 80 million die each year while waiting for transplants.
Under the new system proposed Monday by Health Minister Jens Spahn and a cross-party group of supporters, people would automatically be considered as donors unless they opt out by putting themselves on a register saying they object — which they could do at any time.
Relatives could also tell officials that the deceased made clear they didn\'t want to donate. Everyone aged 16 and over would be informed repeatedly of the new system, while there would be no donations by people who aren\'t in a position to grasp the significance of the decision, for example because of mental disability.
Spahn said 20 out of 28 European Union countries have similar systems and "everything we have tried so far hasn\'t led to a rise in donor figures."
"We still have about 10 times more people on the waiting list for an organ than the number that are transplanted," said Karl Lauterbach, a health policy expert with the center-left Social Democrats. Last year, there were some 9,400 people on the waiting list and well under 1,000 transplants, while about 2,000 people on the waiting list die each year, he said.
Germany\'s parliament is expected eventually to hold a free vote on new rules.
Another cross-party group of lawmakers is calling for people to be regularly asked about their intentions and an online register of donors. The group says it wants to ensure that organ donation remains "a conscious and voluntary decision that cannot be forced by the state."

BERLIN (AP) — German government statistics show crime dropped in the country last year, including violent offenses.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said as he presented an annual crime report on Tuesday that "every crime is one too many, but objectively, this is the lowest level in decades."
Police agencies recorded more than 5.6 million cases in 2018, 3.6 percent fewer than in 2017. They included 185,377 violent crimes, a 1.9 percent decrease from the year before.
Despite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.
The overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent. The clearance rate for solved murder and manslaughter cases was 96.1%.


Germany extends African missions another year
BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s Cabinet has approved extending Germany\'s military missions in Africa for another year.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
The dpa news agency reported Wednesday that that includes German troops taking part in a European Union training mission in Mali known as EUTM, and the United Nations "Minusma" peacekeeping force there.
Dpa reports the Cabinet also plans to extend Germany\'s commitment to the EU\'s anti-piracy mission Atalanta that operates off the Horn of Africa, but to reduce its maximum troop numbers from 600 to 400. There are currently 80 troops taking part.
Germany currently has some 180 troops involved in the EUTM mission, with a maximum of 350. A further 900 are in Mali and Niger as part of the Minusma force, with a maximum of 1,100.
Those troop commitments are to remain unchanged.


Germany raids groups suspected of supporting Hamas

\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have carried out raids on groups suspected of helping the militant Palestinian group Hamas under the guise of providing humanitarian aid.
The interior ministry said some 90 properties across Germany associated with an "Islamist network" were searched on Wednesday. It said the network was headed by two groups based in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, WWR Help and Ansaar International.
The ministry said there are indications that the network provided financial and propaganda support to Hamas, a longtime enemy of Israel that runs the Gaza Strip and was listed as a terror group by the European Union in 2001.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that "anyone who supports Hamas under the cover of humanitarian aid flouts fundamental value judgments of our constitution."

In a statement Tuesday, the ministry said German diplomats expressed concern at the introduction of Sharia law penalties and appealed to Brunei\'s ambassador Monday to "abide by existing international human rights obligations."
The legal change in the tiny, oil-rich monarchy, which also includes amputation for theft, is due to come into force Wednesday.
Human rights group Amnesty International has slammed the punishments as "vicious ."
American actor George Clooney, who is married to prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, called recently for a boycott of luxury hotels in Europe and the United States linked to Brunei\'s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.


Germany says emissions dropped in 2018 amid warm weather
BERLIN (AP) — The German government says greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2% in 2018, the first major decrease in four years.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
Estimates published Tuesday by the Environment Ministry show Germany released the equivalent of 868.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, 38 million less than 2017.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Germany benefited from 2018\'s warm and sunny weather, which increased production of renewable energy and reduced the need for heating fuel.
Germany\'s emissions last year were about 30.6 percent lower than in 1990. The country aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent from that baseline year by 2030 as part of efforts to curb climate change.
Cabinet is debating a bill that could set legally binding emissions goals for each sector of the economy.


Germany: 70-year-old babysitter guilty of killing boy

\t \r
\r
\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — A court in Germany has found a 70-year-old babysitter guilty of manslaughter for the killing of a 7-year-old boy she was looking after.
Judges at the regional court in the southwestern city of Heilbronn sentenced the woman Monday to 10 years and six months in prison.
The trained nurse, who had been the boy\'s babysitter for several years and who he called "Grandma Elisabeth," had strangled the child while he was staying the night at her home.
Judges rejected the defense lawyer\'s arguments that his client, whose full name wasn\'t released because of German privacy rules, had killed the boy by accident, though they did take into consideration that she might have been suffering from depression and been overwhelmed by stress.


Germany charges Afghan man with war crimes

\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they\'ve charged a 26-year-old former Afghan officer with war crimes for allegedly abusing prisoners and defiling the corpse of a man he boasted he\'d "killed like a donkey."
Ahmad Zaheer D., whose last name wasn\'t given in line with privacy laws, is accused of shaking two prisoners by the hair during an interrogation around late 2013 and punching one, while another soldier hit a third with a hose.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that the suspect brought the corpse of a high-ranking enemy commander into a town in March 2014, telling villagers he\'d killed him and putting a meat hook into the corpse\'s head, then stringing the body up with a rope.
He was arrested Oct. 25 near Munich. It wasn\'t clear when he came to Germany.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel has received former U.S. President Barack Obama at her office in Berlin for a meeting characterized by German officials as a routine private encounter with a former international peer.
Obama could be seen waving as he left the chancellery alongside Merkel Friday. Merkel\'s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she has met repeatedly with ex-heads of state and government "with whom she worked together closely and well for a time."
He said the meeting has no implications for current German-U.S. relations. Asked whether it was a signal to President Donald Trump, with whom Germany has a sometimes-complicated relationship, Seibert replied: "I would firmly reject that impression."
Merkel and Obama have already met in Berlin since the former president left office, participating in a discussion at a May 2017 conference.


Sea-Eye asks Germany to help find port for 64 migrants

\t\r
MILAN (AP) — The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says it is asking Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a safe port for the 64 migrants it rescued off Libya earlier this week.
Sea-Watch spokesman Carlotta Weibl said Friday that the rescue boat Alan Kurdi remains in international waters off Lampedusa and will not approach Italy\'s southernmost island until it has permission.
She said conditions on board were worsening and that a storm was approaching. She said a request has been made to the German foreign ministry to find a solution.
Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers to pack unseaworthy rubber dinghies with migrants looking for sanctuary in Europe.

BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s environment minister says the government will discuss introducing a carbon tax as part of its national plan to curb climate change.
Speaking after the first meeting of a special "climate Cabinet," German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Wednesday that government ministers would, over the coming months, put forward proposals for cutting greenhouse gases in the areas they oversee.
Germany\'s transport ministry opposes sector-specific targets, but Schulze insisted "everyone will have to shoulder some of the responsibility."
She also displayed openness to some kind of carbon tax. Other countries have already introduced carbon pricing to discourage the burning of fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases and stoke global warming.
Schulze said of such carbon taxes that "there are many different models that will also be debated in Cabinet."


Germany indicts suspected rebel over Sri Lanka war crimes
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have indicted a Sri Lankan man suspected of involvement in killing 15 captured government soldiers while fighting for the Tamil Tigers rebel group.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
Federal prosecutors said Friday that 37-year-old Sivatheeban B. is accused of membership in a foreign terrorist organization, war crimes, two cases of manslaughter and 11 cases of attempted manslaughter.
The man, whose surname wasn\'t released due to German privacy rules, was arrested in August.
Prosecutors allege that in 2008 the suspect guarded 15 captured soldiers as they were driven to a site where they were executed, and later helped burn their bodies. In a separate incident a year later, he fired on 13 soldiers, two of whom died.
The rebel group, which fought for a separate state for ethnic minority Tamils, was defeated in 2009.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.
Affordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\'t think that is the right solution. He said "the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available."
Andres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a "false solution."

Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that 50-year-old Manmohan S. is accused of providing information to India\'s foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, from January 2015 onward.

BERLIN (AP) — German government statistics show crime dropped in the country last year, including violent offenses.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said as he presented an annual crime report on Tuesday that "every crime is one too many, but objectively, this is the lowest level in decades."

Despite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.
The overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent. The clearance rate for solved murder and manslaughter cases was 96.1%.

BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they\'ve charged a 26-year-old former Afghan officer with war crimes for allegedly abusing prisoners and defiling the corpse of a man he boasted he\'d "killed like a donkey."
Ahmad Zaheer D., whose last name wasn\'t given in line with privacy laws, is accused of shaking two prisoners by the hair during an interrogation around late 2013 and punching one, while another soldier hit a third with a hose.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that the suspect brought the corpse of a high-ranking enemy commander into a town in March 2014, telling villagers he\'d killed him and putting a meat hook into the corpse\'s head, then stringing the body up with a rope.
He was arrested Oct. 25 near Munich. It wasn\'t clear when he came to Germany.

BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have indicted a Sri Lankan man suspected of involvement in killing 15 captured government soldiers while fighting for the Tamil Tigers rebel group.
Federal prosecutors said Friday that 37-year-old Sivatheeban B. is accused of membership in a foreign terrorist organization, war crimes, two cases of manslaughter and 11 cases of attempted manslaughter.
The man, whose surname wasn\'t released due to German privacy rules, was arrested in August.
Prosecutors allege that in 2008 the suspect guarded 15 captured soldiers as they were driven to a site where they were executed, and later helped burn their bodies. In a separate incident a year later, he fired on 13 soldiers, two of whom died.
The rebel group, which fought for a separate state for ethnic minority Tamils, was defeated in 2009.

BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s environment minister says the government will discuss introducing a carbon tax as part of its national plan to curb climate change.
Speaking after the first meeting of a special "climate Cabinet," German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Wednesday that government ministers would, over the coming months, put forward proposals for cutting greenhouse gases in the areas they oversee.
Germany\'s transport ministry opposes sector-specific targets, but Schulze insisted "everyone will have to shoulder some of the responsibility."
She also displayed openness to some kind of carbon tax. Other countries have already introduced carbon pricing to discourage the burning of fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases and stoke global warming.
Schulze said of such carbon taxes that "there are many different models that will also be debated in Cabinet."

MILAN (AP) — The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says it is asking Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a safe port for the 64 migrants it rescued off Libya earlier this week.
Sea-Watch spokesman Carlotta Weibl said Friday that the rescue boat Alan Kurdi remains in international waters off Lampedusa and will not approach Italy\'s southernmost island until it has permission.
She said conditions on board were worsening and that a storm was approaching. She said a request has been made to the German foreign ministry to find a solution.
Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers to pack unseaworthy rubber dinghies with migrants looking for sanctuary in Europe.

BERLIN (AP) — Police in northern Germany say they have detained a 17-year-old boy with several knives after being tipped off to an online chat in which someone threatened to kill several people at a school.
Officers checked students entering the school in Flensburg, just south of the Danish border, on Wednesday morning and detained the German teenager. Police said initial investigations firmed up suspicions against him, without elaborating. The chat surfaced on Tuesday evening and the threat applied to Wednesday.
Lessons were held as normal after boy was detained.


Germany says emissions dropped in 2018 amid warm weather
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — The German government says greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2% in 2018, the first major decrease in four years.
Estimates published Tuesday by the Environment Ministry show Germany released the equivalent of 868.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, 38 million less than 2017.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Germany benefited from 2018\'s warm and sunny weather, which increased production of renewable energy and reduced the need for heating fuel.
Germany\'s emissions last year were about 30.6 percent lower than in 1990. The country aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent from that baseline year by 2030 as part of efforts to curb climate change.
Cabinet is debating a bill that could set legally binding emissions goals for each sector of the economy.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.
\t
\t
Affordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.
\t
\t
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\'t think that is the right solution. He said "the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available."
\t
Andres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a "false solution."

BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they have indicted two Indian citizens for spying on the Sikh opposition and Kashmiri separatists in Germany.

Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that 50-year-old Manmohan S. is accused of providing information to India\'s foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, from January 2015 onward.
\t
\t
His wife, 51-year-old Kanwal Jit K., allegedly also began cooperating with the spy agency starting in July 2017. Their full names weren\'t released due to German privacy rules.
\t
Prosecutors said the couple is accused of receiving a total of 7,200 euros (about $8,100) for the information they provided to their handler, who was stationed in Germany.

BERLIN (AP) — A court in Germany has found a 70-year-old babysitter guilty of manslaughter for the killing of a 7-year-old boy she was looking after.
\t
Judges at the regional court in the southwestern city of Heilbronn sentenced the woman Monday to 10 years and six months in prison.
\t
\t
The trained nurse, who had been the boy\'s babysitter for several years and who he called "Grandma Elisabeth," had strangled the child while he was staying the night at her home.
\t
Judges rejected the defense lawyer\'s arguments that his client, whose full name wasn\'t released because of German privacy rules, had killed the boy by accident, though they did take into consideration that she might have been suffering from depression and been overwhelmed by stress.

\t
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have carried out raids on groups suspected of helping the militant Palestinian group Hamas under the guise of providing humanitarian aid.
\t
The interior ministry said some 90 properties across Germany associated with an "Islamist network" were searched on Wednesday. It said the network was headed by two groups based in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, WWR Help and Ansaar International.
\t
\t
The ministry said there are indications that the network provided financial and propaganda support to Hamas, a longtime enemy of Israel that runs the Gaza Strip and was listed as a terror group by the European Union in 2001.
\t
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that "anyone who supports Hamas under the cover of humanitarian aid flouts fundamental value judgments of our constitution."


\t
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s health minister on Monday launched a drive to tackle a shortage of donor organs with a reform that would make most people potential organ donors unless they object.
\t
\t
At present, doctors in Germany can transplant organs only from people who actively declare their willingness, for example by carrying a donor card or making a living will. Around 2,000 people in the country of 80 million die each year while waiting for transplants.
\t
Under the new system proposed Monday by Health Minister Jens Spahn and a cross-party group of supporters, people would automatically be considered as donors unless they opt out by putting themselves on a register saying they object — which they could do at any time.
\t
Relatives could also tell officials that the deceased made clear they didn\'t want to donate. Everyone aged 16 and over would be informed repeatedly of the new system, while there would be no donations by people who aren\'t in a position to grasp the significance of the decision, for example because of mental disability.
\t
Spahn said 20 out of 28 European Union countries have similar systems and "everything we have tried so far hasn\'t led to a rise in donor figures."
\t
"We still have about 10 times more people on the waiting list for an organ than the number that are transplanted," said Karl Lauterbach, a health policy expert with the center-left Social Democrats. Last year, there were some 9,400 people on the waiting list and well under 1,000 transplants, while about 2,000 people on the waiting list die each year, he said.
\t
Germany\'s parliament is expected eventually to hold a free vote on new rules.
\t
Another cross-party group of lawmakers is calling for people to be regularly asked about their intentions and an online register of donors. The group says it wants to ensure that organ donation remains "a conscious and voluntary decision that cannot be forced by the state."


\t
BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s Cabinet has approved extending Germany\'s military missions in Africa for another year.
\t
The dpa news agency reported Wednesday that that includes German troops taking part in a European Union training mission in Mali known as EUTM, and the United Nations "Minusma" peacekeeping force there.
\t
\t
Dpa reports the Cabinet also plans to extend Germany\'s commitment to the EU\'s anti-piracy mission Atalanta that operates off the Horn of Africa, but to reduce its maximum troop numbers from 600 to 400. There are currently 80 troops taking part.
\t
Germany currently has some 180 troops involved in the EUTM mission, with a maximum of 350. A further 900 are in Mali and Niger as part of the Minusma force, with a maximum of 1,100.
\t
Those troop commitments are to remain unchanged.

\t
\t
He said the meeting has no implications for current German-U.S. relations. Asked whether it was a signal to President Donald Trump, with whom Germany has a sometimes-complicated relationship, Seibert replied: "I would firmly reject that impression."

Despite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.
The overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent. The clearance rate for solved murder and manslaughter cases was 96.1%.


Germany mulls new rules to boost organ donations
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s health minister on Monday launched a drive to tackle a shortage of donor organs with a reform that would make most people potential organ donors unless they object.
At present, doctors in Germany can transplant organs only from people who actively declare their willingness, for example by carrying a donor card or making a living will. Around 2,000 people in the country of 80 million die each year while waiting for transplants.
Under the new system proposed Monday by Health Minister Jens Spahn and a cross-party group of supporters, people would automatically be considered as donors unless they opt out by putting themselves on a register saying they object — which they could do at any time.
Relatives could also tell officials that the deceased made clear they didn\'t want to donate. Everyone aged 16 and over would be informed repeatedly of the new system, while there would be no donations by people who aren\'t in a position to grasp the significance of the decision, for example because of mental disability.
Spahn said 20 out of 28 European Union countries have similar systems and "everything we have tried so far hasn\'t led to a rise in donor figures."
"We still have about 10 times more people on the waiting list for an organ than the number that are transplanted," said Karl Lauterbach, a health policy expert with the center-left Social Democrats. Last year, there were some 9,400 people on the waiting list and well under 1,000 transplants, while about 2,000 people on the waiting list die each year, he said.
Germany\'s parliament is expected eventually to hold a free vote on new rules.
Another cross-party group of lawmakers is calling for people to be regularly asked about their intentions and an online register of donors. The group says it wants to ensure that organ donation remains "a conscious and voluntary decision that cannot be forced by the state."


Germany charges Afghan man with war crimes
BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they\'ve charged a 26-year-old former Afghan officer with war crimes for allegedly abusing prisoners and defiling the corpse of a man he boasted he\'d "killed like a donkey."
Ahmad Zaheer D., whose last name wasn\'t given in line with privacy laws, is accused of shaking two prisoners by the hair during an interrogation around late 2013 and punching one, while another soldier hit a third with a hose.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that the suspect brought the corpse of a high-ranking enemy commander into a town in March 2014, telling villagers he\'d killed him and putting a meat hook into the corpse\'s head, then stringing the body up with a rope.
He was arrested Oct. 25 near Munich. It wasn\'t clear when he came to Germany.

BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s environment minister says the government will discuss introducing a carbon tax as part of its national plan to curb climate change.
Speaking after the first meeting of a special "climate Cabinet," German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Wednesday that government ministers would, over the coming months, put forward proposals for cutting greenhouse gases in the areas they oversee.
Germany\'s transport ministry opposes sector-specific targets, but Schulze insisted "everyone will have to shoulder some of the responsibility."
She also displayed openness to some kind of carbon tax. Other countries have already introduced carbon pricing to discourage the burning of fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases and stoke global warming.
Schulze said of such carbon taxes that "there are many different models that will also be debated in Cabinet."


Germany raids groups suspected of supporting Hamas
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have carried out raids on groups suspected of helping the militant Palestinian group Hamas under the guise of providing humanitarian aid.
The interior ministry said some 90 properties across Germany associated with an "Islamist network" were searched on Wednesday. It said the network was headed by two groups based in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, WWR Help and Ansaar International.
The ministry said there are indications that the network provided financial and propaganda support to Hamas, a longtime enemy of Israel that runs the Gaza Strip and was listed as a terror group by the European Union in 2001.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that "anyone who supports Hamas under the cover of humanitarian aid flouts fundamental value judgments of our constitution."


Germany says emissions dropped in 2018 amid warm weather
BERLIN (AP) — The German government says greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2% in 2018, the first major decrease in four years.
Estimates published Tuesday by the Environment Ministry show Germany released the equivalent of 868.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, 38 million less than 2017.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Germany benefited from 2018\'s warm and sunny weather, which increased production of renewable energy and reduced the need for heating fuel.
Germany\'s emissions last year were about 30.6 percent lower than in 1990. The country aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent from that baseline year by 2030 as part of efforts to curb climate change.
Cabinet is debating a bill that could set legally binding emissions goals for each sector of the economy.


Germany extends African missions another year
BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s Cabinet has approved extending Germany\'s military missions in Africa for another year.
The dpa news agency reported Wednesday that that includes German troops taking part in a European Union training mission in Mali known as EUTM, and the United Nations "Minusma" peacekeeping force there.
Dpa reports the Cabinet also plans to extend Germany\'s commitment to the EU\'s anti-piracy mission Atalanta that operates off the Horn of Africa, but to reduce its maximum troop numbers from 600 to 400. There are currently 80 troops taking part.
Germany currently has some 180 troops involved in the EUTM mission, with a maximum of 350. A further 900 are in Mali and Niger as part of the Minusma force, with a maximum of 1,100.
Those troop commitments are to remain unchanged.


Germany indicts Indian couple with spying on Sikh opposition

Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that 50-year-old Manmohan S. is accused of providing information to India\'s foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, from January 2015 onward.
His wife, 51-year-old Kanwal Jit K., allegedly also began cooperating with the spy agency starting in July 2017. Their full names weren\'t released due to German privacy rules.
Prosecutors said the couple is accused of receiving a total of 7,200 euros (about $8,100) for the information they provided to their handler, who was stationed in Germany.


Germany protests to Brunei envoy over anti-gay law plans
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s Foreign Ministry has protested Brunei\'s plans to implement Islamic criminal laws that punishes gay sex by stoning offenders to death.
In a statement Tuesday, the ministry said German diplomats expressed concern at the introduction of Sharia law penalties and appealed to Brunei\'s ambassador Monday to "abide by existing international human rights obligations."
The legal change in the tiny, oil-rich monarchy, which also includes amputation for theft, is due to come into force Wednesday.
Human rights group Amnesty International has slammed the punishments as "vicious ."
American actor George Clooney, who is married to prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, called recently for a boycott of luxury hotels in Europe and the United States linked to Brunei\'s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.


Germany: 70-year-old babysitter guilty of killing boy
BERLIN (AP) — A court in Germany has found a 70-year-old babysitter guilty of manslaughter for the killing of a 7-year-old boy she was looking after.
Judges at the regional court in the southwestern city of Heilbronn sentenced the woman Monday to 10 years and six months in prison.
The trained nurse, who had been the boy\'s babysitter for several years and who he called "Grandma Elisabeth," had strangled the child while he was staying the night at her home.
Judges rejected the defense lawyer\'s arguments that his client, whose full name wasn\'t released because of German privacy rules, had killed the boy by accident, though they did take into consideration that she might have been suffering from depression and been overwhelmed by stress.


BERLIN
A comedy of goalkeeping errors, including two howlers from Wolfsburg keeper Almuth Schult, saw Germany labour to a 2-2 draw with Japan on Tuesday in their penultimate friendly before the World Cup.
"They were stupid mistakes. I am just happy that I made them today rather than in a competitive match," Schult told ZDF.
Coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg used the fixture in Paderborn to test out younger players, giving a first start to 17-year-old midfielder Sophie Oberdorf.
Germany, ranked second in the world, were the better side for much of the first half, but they went behind on 35 minutes after a moment of madness from goalkeeper Schult.
Having had nothing to do for the first half an hour, Schult misplaced a simple pass to a defender, allowing Yui Hasegawa to lob the ball over her.
Captain Alexandra Popp headed Germany level after half-time, before another poor pass from Schult saw Japan restore the lead. Gifted possession by the Germany keeper, Emi Nakajima linked up with Kumi Yokoyoma, who slotted the ball home.
Just a few minutes later, Schult\'s opposite number Chika Hirao failed to hold onto a cross and allowed Svenja Huth to head the ball in from close range.
Germany face Chile in Regensburg in their final World Cup test on May 30 before they begin their campaign nine days later against China in the French city of Rennes.


Germany: teen with knives detained after school threat
BERLIN (AP) — Police in northern Germany say they have detained a 17-year-old boy with several knives after being tipped off to an online chat in which someone threatened to kill several people at a school.
Officers checked students entering the school in Flensburg, just south of the Danish border, on Wednesday morning and detained the German teenager. Police said initial investigations firmed up suspicions against him, without elaborating. The chat surfaced on Tuesday evening and the threat applied to Wednesday.
Lessons were held as normal after boy was detained.


Sea-Eye asks Germany to help find port for 64 migrants
MILAN (AP) — The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says it is asking Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a safe port for the 64 migrants it rescued off Libya earlier this week.
Sea-Watch spokesman Carlotta Weibl said Friday that the rescue boat Alan Kurdi remains in international waters off Lampedusa and will not approach Italy\'s southernmost island until it has permission.
She said conditions on board were worsening and that a storm was approaching. She said a request has been made to the German foreign ministry to find a solution.
Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers to pack unseaworthy rubber dinghies with migrants looking for sanctuary in Europe.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel has received former U.S. President Barack Obama at her office in Berlin for a meeting characterized by German officials as a routine private encounter with a former international peer.
Obama could be seen waving as he left the chancellery alongside Merkel Friday. Merkel\'s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she has met repeatedly with ex-heads of state and government "with whom she worked together closely and well for a time."
He said the meeting has no implications for current German-U.S. relations. Asked whether it was a signal to President Donald Trump, with whom Germany has a sometimes-complicated relationship, Seibert replied: "I would firmly reject that impression."
Merkel and Obama have already met in Berlin since the former president left office, participating in a discussion at a May 2017 conference.


Germany mulls new rules to boost organ donations
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s health minister on Monday launched a drive to tackle a shortage of donor organs with a reform that would make most people potential organ donors unless they object.
At present, doctors in Germany can transplant organs only from people who actively declare their willingness, for example by carrying a donor card or making a living will. Around 2,000 people in the country of 80 million die each year while waiting for transplants.
Under the new system proposed Monday by Health Minister Jens Spahn and a cross-party group of supporters, people would automatically be considered as donors unless they opt out by putting themselves on a register saying they object — which they could do at any time.
Relatives could also tell officials that the deceased made clear they didn\'t want to donate. Everyone aged 16 and over would be informed repeatedly of the new system, while there would be no donations by people who aren\'t in a position to grasp the significance of the decision, for example because of mental disability.
Spahn said 20 out of 28 European Union countries have similar systems and "everything we have tried so far hasn\'t led to a rise in donor figures."
"We still have about 10 times more people on the waiting list for an organ than the number that are transplanted," said Karl Lauterbach, a health policy expert with the center-left Social Democrats. Last year, there were some 9,400 people on the waiting list and well under 1,000 transplants, while about 2,000 people on the waiting list die each year, he said.
Germany\'s parliament is expected eventually to hold a free vote on new rules.
Another cross-party group of lawmakers is calling for people to be regularly asked about their intentions and an online register of donors. The group says it wants to ensure that organ donation remains "a conscious and voluntary decision that cannot be forced by the state."

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.
Affordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\'t think that is the right solution. He said "the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available."
Andres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a "false solution."

Germany indicts suspected rebel over Sri Lanka war crimes
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have indicted a Sri Lankan man suspected of involvement in killing 15 captured government soldiers while fighting for the Tamil Tigers rebel group.
Federal prosecutors said Friday that 37-year-old Sivatheeban B. is accused of membership in a foreign terrorist organization, war crimes, two cases of manslaughter and 11 cases of attempted manslaughter.
The man, whose surname wasn\'t released due to German privacy rules, was arrested in August.
Prosecutors allege that in 2008 the suspect guarded 15 captured soldiers as they were driven to a site where they were executed, and later helped burn their bodies. In a separate incident a year later, he fired on 13 soldiers, two of whom died.
The rebel group, which fought for a separate state for ethnic minority Tamils, was defeated in 2009.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.
Affordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\'t think that is the right solution. He said "the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available."
Andres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a "false solution."

BERLIN (AP) — German government statistics show crime dropped in the country last year, including violent offenses.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said as he presented an annual crime report on Tuesday that "every crime is one too many, but objectively, this is the lowest level in decades."
Police agencies recorded more than 5.6 million cases in 2018, 3.6 percent fewer than in 2017. They included 185,377 violent crimes, a 1.9 percent decrease from the year before.
Despite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.
The overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent. The clearance rate for solved murder and manslaughter cases was 96.1%.


Germany says emissions dropped in 2018 amid warm weather
BERLIN (AP) — The German government says greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2% in 2018, the first major decrease in four years.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
Estimates published Tuesday by the Environment Ministry show Germany released the equivalent of 868.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, 38 million less than 2017.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Germany benefited from 2018\'s warm and sunny weather, which increased production of renewable energy and reduced the need for heating fuel.
Germany\'s emissions last year were about 30.6 percent lower than in 1990. The country aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent from that baseline year by 2030 as part of efforts to curb climate change.
Cabinet is debating a bill that could set legally binding emissions goals for each sector of the economy.


Germany raids groups suspected of supporting Hamas

\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have carried out raids on groups suspected of helping the militant Palestinian group Hamas under the guise of providing humanitarian aid.
The interior ministry said some 90 properties across Germany associated with an "Islamist network" were searched on Wednesday. It said the network was headed by two groups based in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, WWR Help and Ansaar International.
The ministry said there are indications that the network provided financial and propaganda support to Hamas, a longtime enemy of Israel that runs the Gaza Strip and was listed as a terror group by the European Union in 2001.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that "anyone who supports Hamas under the cover of humanitarian aid flouts fundamental value judgments of our constitution."


Germany extends African missions another year
BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s Cabinet has approved extending Germany\'s military missions in Africa for another year.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
The dpa news agency reported Wednesday that that includes German troops taking part in a European Union training mission in Mali known as EUTM, and the United Nations "Minusma" peacekeeping force there.
Dpa reports the Cabinet also plans to extend Germany\'s commitment to the EU\'s anti-piracy mission Atalanta that operates off the Horn of Africa, but to reduce its maximum troop numbers from 600 to 400. There are currently 80 troops taking part.
Germany currently has some 180 troops involved in the EUTM mission, with a maximum of 350. A further 900 are in Mali and Niger as part of the Minusma force, with a maximum of 1,100.
Those troop commitments are to remain unchanged.

BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they have indicted two Indian citizens for spying on the Sikh opposition and Kashmiri separatists in Germany.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that 50-year-old Manmohan S. is accused of providing information to India\'s foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, from January 2015 onward.
His wife, 51-year-old Kanwal Jit K., allegedly also began cooperating with the spy agency starting in July 2017. Their full names weren\'t released due to German privacy rules.
Prosecutors said the couple is accused of receiving a total of 7,200 euros (about $8,100) for the information they provided to their handler, who was stationed in Germany.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel has received former U.S. President Barack Obama at her office in Berlin for a meeting characterized by German officials as a routine private encounter with a former international peer.
Obama could be seen waving as he left the chancellery alongside Merkel Friday. Merkel\'s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she has met repeatedly with ex-heads of state and government "with whom she worked together closely and well for a time."
He said the meeting has no implications for current German-U.S. relations. Asked whether it was a signal to President Donald Trump, with whom Germany has a sometimes-complicated relationship, Seibert replied: "I would firmly reject that impression."
Merkel and Obama have already met in Berlin since the former president left office, participating in a discussion at a May 2017 conference.


Germany charges Afghan man with war crimes

BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they\'ve charged a 26-year-old former Afghan officer with war crimes for allegedly abusing prisoners and defiling the corpse of a man he boasted he\'d "killed like a donkey."
Ahmad Zaheer D., whose last name wasn\'t given in line with privacy laws, is accused of shaking two prisoners by the hair during an interrogation around late 2013 and punching one, while another soldier hit a third with a hose.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that the suspect brought the corpse of a high-ranking enemy commander into a town in March 2014, telling villagers he\'d killed him and putting a meat hook into the corpse\'s head, then stringing the body up with a rope.
He was arrested Oct. 25 near Munich. It wasn\'t clear when he came to Germany.


Germany mulls new rules to boost organ donations
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s health minister is launching a drive to tackle a shortage of donor organs with a reform that would make most people potential organ donors unless they object.
At present, doctors in Germany can transplant organs only from people who actively register and carry a donor card. Under the new system proposed Monday by Health Minister Jens Spahn and cross-party supporters, people would automatically be considered as donors unless they opt out by putting themselves on a register saying they object — which they could do at any time.
Relatives could also tell officials that the deceased made clear they didn\'t want to donate.
Spahn said 20 other European Union countries have similar systems and "everything we have tried so far hasn\'t led to a rise in donor figures."


Germany indicts suspected rebel over Sri Lanka war crimes
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have indicted a Sri Lankan man suspected of involvement in killing 15 captured government soldiers while fighting for the Tamil Tigers rebel group.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
Federal prosecutors said Friday that 37-year-old Sivatheeban B. is accused of membership in a foreign terrorist organization, war crimes, two cases of manslaughter and 11 cases of attempted manslaughter.
The man, whose surname wasn\'t released due to German privacy rules, was arrested in August.
Prosecutors allege that in 2008 the suspect guarded 15 captured soldiers as they were driven to a site where they were executed, and later helped burn their bodies. In a separate incident a year later, he fired on 13 soldiers, two of whom died.
The rebel group, which fought for a separate state for ethnic minority Tamils, was defeated in 2009.


Germany: 70-year-old babysitter guilty of killing boy

\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — A court in Germany has found a 70-year-old babysitter guilty of manslaughter for the killing of a 7-year-old boy she was looking after.
Judges at the regional court in the southwestern city of Heilbronn sentenced the woman Monday to 10 years and six months in prison.
The trained nurse, who had been the boy\'s babysitter for several years and who he called "Grandma Elisabeth," had strangled the child while he was staying the night at her home.
Judges rejected the defense lawyer\'s arguments that his client, whose full name wasn\'t released because of German privacy rules, had killed the boy by accident, though they did take into consideration that she might have been suffering from depression and been overwhelmed by stress.

BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s environment minister says the government will discuss introducing a carbon tax as part of its national plan to curb climate change.
Speaking after the first meeting of a special "climate Cabinet," German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Wednesday that government ministers would, over the coming months, put forward proposals for cutting greenhouse gases in the areas they oversee.
Germany\'s transport ministry opposes sector-specific targets, but Schulze insisted "everyone will have to shoulder some of the responsibility."
She also displayed openness to some kind of carbon tax. Other countries have already introduced carbon pricing to discourage the burning of fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases and stoke global warming.
Schulze said of such carbon taxes that "there are many different models that will also be debated in Cabinet."

BERLIN (AP) — Police in northern Germany say they have detained a 17-year-old boy with several knives after being tipped off to an online chat in which someone threatened to kill several people at a school.
Officers checked students entering the school in Flensburg, just south of the Danish border, on Wednesday morning and detained the German teenager.

Lessons were held as normal after boy was detained.


Sea-Eye asks Germany to help find port for 64 migrants
\r

\t \r
\r
\t\r
MILAN (AP) — The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says it is asking Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a safe port for the 64 migrants it rescued off Libya earlier this week.
Sea-Watch spokesman Carlotta Weibl said Friday that the rescue boat Alan Kurdi remains in international waters off Lampedusa and will not approach Italy\'s southernmost island until it has permission.
She said conditions on board were worsening and that a storm was approaching. She said a request has been made to the German foreign ministry to find a solution.
Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers to pack unseaworthy rubber dinghies with migrants looking for sanctuary in Europe.


Germany protests to Brunei envoy over anti-gay law plans
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s Foreign Ministry has protested Brunei\'s plans to implement Islamic criminal laws that punishes gay sex by stoning offenders to death.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
In a statement Tuesday, the ministry said German diplomats expressed concern at the introduction of Sharia law penalties and appealed to Brunei\'s ambassador Monday to "abide by existing international human rights obligations."
The legal change in the tiny, oil-rich monarchy, which also includes amputation for theft, is due to come into force Wednesday.
Human rights group Amnesty International has slammed the punishments as "vicious ."
American actor George Clooney, who is married to prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, called recently for a boycott of luxury hotels in Europe and the United States linked to Brunei\'s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel has received former U.S. President Barack Obama at her office in Berlin for a meeting characterized by German officials as a routine private encounter with a former international peer.
Obama could be seen waving as he left the chancellery alongside Merkel Friday. Merkel\'s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she has met repeatedly with ex-heads of state and government "with whom she worked together closely and well for a time."
He said the meeting has no implications for current German-U.S. relations. Asked whether it was a signal to President Donald Trump, with whom Germany has a sometimes-complicated relationship, Seibert replied: "I would firmly reject that impression."
Merkel and Obama have already met in Berlin since the former president left office, participating in a discussion at a May 2017 conference.


Germany extends African missions another year
BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s Cabinet has approved extending Germany\'s military missions in Africa for another year.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
The dpa news agency reported Wednesday that that includes German troops taking part in a European Union training mission in Mali known as EUTM, and the United Nations "Minusma" peacekeeping force there.
Dpa reports the Cabinet also plans to extend Germany\'s commitment to the EU\'s anti-piracy mission Atalanta that operates off the Horn of Africa, but to reduce its maximum troop numbers from 600 to 400. There are currently 80 troops taking part.
Germany currently has some 180 troops involved in the EUTM mission, with a maximum of 350. A further 900 are in Mali and Niger as part of the Minusma force, with a maximum of 1,100.
Those troop commitments are to remain unchanged.

MILAN (AP) — The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says it is asking Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a safe port for the 64 migrants it rescued off Libya earlier this week.
Sea-Watch spokesman Carlotta Weibl said Friday that the rescue boat Alan Kurdi remains in international waters off Lampedusa and will not approach Italy\'s southernmost island until it has permission.
She said conditions on board were worsening and that a storm was approaching. She said a request has been made to the German foreign ministry to find a solution.
Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers to pack unseaworthy rubber dinghies with migrants looking for sanctuary in Europe.


Germany says emissions dropped in 2018 amid warm weather
BERLIN (AP) — The German government says greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2% in 2018, the first major decrease in four years.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
Estimates published Tuesday by the Environment Ministry show Germany released the equivalent of 868.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, 38 million less than 2017.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Germany benefited from 2018\'s warm and sunny weather, which increased production of renewable energy and reduced the need for heating fuel.
Germany\'s emissions last year were about 30.6 percent lower than in 1990. The country aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent from that baseline year by 2030 as part of efforts to curb climate change.
Cabinet is debating a bill that could set legally binding emissions goals for each sector of the economy.

BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have carried out raids on groups suspected of helping the militant Palestinian group Hamas under the guise of providing humanitarian aid.
The interior ministry said some 90 properties across Germany associated with an "Islamist network" were searched on Wednesday. It said the network was headed by two groups based in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, WWR Help and Ansaar International.
The ministry said there are indications that the network provided financial and propaganda support to Hamas, a longtime enemy of Israel that runs the Gaza Strip and was listed as a terror group by the European Union in 2001.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that "anyone who supports Hamas under the cover of humanitarian aid flouts fundamental value judgments of our constitution."

In a statement Tuesday, the ministry said German diplomats expressed concern at the introduction of Sharia law penalties and appealed to Brunei\'s ambassador Monday to "abide by existing international human rights obligations."
The legal change in the tiny, oil-rich monarchy, which also includes amputation for theft, is due to come into force Wednesday.
Human rights group Amnesty International has slammed the punishments as "vicious ."
American actor George Clooney, who is married to prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, called recently for a boycott of luxury hotels in Europe and the United States linked to Brunei\'s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.

\r
"I believe that successful Bulgarian-German Economic Partnership provides a reasonable basis to believe that Bulgaria is ready and deserves to have a strategic investor with a closed production cycle," said the Bulgarian head of state.

One of Russia\'s richest women died on Sunday in a small private plane crash in Germany, news agencies reported.
\r
Natalia Filleva(55), co-owner of S7 Group\'s second-largest air carrier, has traveled on a single-engine six-seat Epic LT, which crashed and burned in the field, while making a landing at the small Egelsbach airport at 15.30 on Sunday, Filleva said.
\r
Business magazine Forbes estimates Natalia Filleva\'s wealth at $ 600 million.
\r
Natalia Filleva is the co-owner of the company Es7 Group, which is the second largest after Aeroflot.
\r
The Associate Press adds that the ES7 Group has a base at Moscow\'s Domodedovo Airport and is flying to 150 destinations in 35 countries, using 56 Airbus and 23 Boeing.

German police reported that there were two passengers and one pilot on board the plane. The plane traveled from Cannes (France) to Eggelsbach, about 10 km south of Frankfurt.
\r
A local police spokesman said in the plane allegedly traveled two Russian citizens had been completely burned, making identification of the victims more difficult.
\r

\r
The company "Es7 Group" confirmed the death of Natalia Filleva and expressed condolences to the family, the news agencies reported.
\r
The German aviation authorities are investigating the cause of the crash. According to a representative of the German Air Safety Service, the pilot may have lost control of the machine during the maneuver before landing.
\r
A police car, responding to the plane crash, crashed in the front with another car, where three policemen were severely injured, and the two passengers in the other car were killed.

Germany charges Afghan man with war crimes
BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they\'ve charged a 26-year-old former Afghan officer with war crimes for allegedly abusing prisoners and defiling the corpse of a man he boasted he\'d "killed like a donkey."
Ahmad Zaheer D., whose last name wasn\'t given in line with privacy laws, is accused of shaking two prisoners by the hair during an interrogation around late 2013 and punching one, while another soldier hit a third with a hose.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that the suspect brought the corpse of a high-ranking enemy commander into a town in March 2014, telling villagers he\'d killed him and putting a meat hook into the corpse\'s head, then stringing the body up with a rope.
He was arrested Oct. 25 near Munich. It wasn\'t clear when he came to Germany.


Germany mulls new rules to boost organ donations
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s health minister is launching a drive to tackle a shortage of donor organs with a reform that would make most people potential organ donors unless they object.
At present, doctors in Germany can transplant organs only from people who actively register and carry a donor card. Under the new system proposed Monday by Health Minister Jens Spahn and cross-party supporters, people would automatically be considered as donors unless they opt out by putting themselves on a register saying they object — which they could do at any time.
Relatives could also tell officials that the deceased made clear they didn\'t want to donate.
Spahn said 20 other European Union countries have similar systems and "everything we have tried so far hasn\'t led to a rise in donor figures."

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.
Affordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\'t think that is the right solution. He said "the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available."
Andres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a "false solution."

Germany: 70-year-old babysitter guilty of killing boy
BERLIN (AP) — A court in Germany has found a 70-year-old babysitter guilty of manslaughter for the killing of a 7-year-old boy she was looking after.
Judges at the regional court in the southwestern city of Heilbronn sentenced the woman Monday to 10 years and six months in prison.
The trained nurse, who had been the boy\'s babysitter for several years and who he called "Grandma Elisabeth," had strangled the child while he was staying the night at her home.
Judges rejected the defense lawyer\'s arguments that his client, whose full name wasn\'t released because of German privacy rules, had killed the boy by accident, though they did take into consideration that she might have been suffering from depression and been overwhelmed by stress.

BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s environment minister says the government will discuss introducing a carbon tax as part of its national plan to curb climate change.
Speaking after the first meeting of a special "climate Cabinet," German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Wednesday that government ministers would, over the coming months, put forward proposals for cutting greenhouse gases in the areas they oversee.
Germany\'s transport ministry opposes sector-specific targets, but Schulze insisted "everyone will have to shoulder some of the responsibility."
She also displayed openness to some kind of carbon tax. Other countries have already introduced carbon pricing to discourage the burning of fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases and stoke global warming.
Schulze said of such carbon taxes that "there are many different models that will also be debated in Cabinet."


Sea-Eye asks Germany to help find port for 64 migrants
MILAN (AP) — The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says it is asking Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a safe port for the 64 migrants it rescued off Libya earlier this week.
Sea-Watch spokesman Carlotta Weibl said Friday that the rescue boat Alan Kurdi remains in international waters off Lampedusa and will not approach Italy\'s southernmost island until it has permission.
She said conditions on board were worsening and that a storm was approaching. She said a request has been made to the German foreign ministry to find a solution.
Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers to pack unseaworthy rubber dinghies with migrants looking for sanctuary in Europe.


Germany indicts suspected rebel over Sri Lanka war crimes
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have indicted a Sri Lankan man suspected of involvement in killing 15 captured government soldiers while fighting for the Tamil Tigers rebel group.
Federal prosecutors said Friday that 37-year-old Sivatheeban B. is accused of membership in a foreign terrorist organization, war crimes, two cases of manslaughter and 11 cases of attempted manslaughter.
The man, whose surname wasn\'t released due to German privacy rules, was arrested in August.
Prosecutors allege that in 2008 the suspect guarded 15 captured soldiers as they were driven to a site where they were executed, and later helped burn their bodies. In a separate incident a year later, he fired on 13 soldiers, two of whom died.
The rebel group, which fought for a separate state for ethnic minority Tamils, was defeated in 2009.


Germany indicts Indian couple with spying on Sikh opposition

His wife, 51-year-old Kanwal Jit K., allegedly also began cooperating with the spy agency starting in July 2017. Their full names weren\'t released due to German privacy rules.
Prosecutors said the couple is accused of receiving a total of 7,200 euros (about $8,100) for the information they provided to their handler, who was stationed in Germany.

BERLIN (AP) — German government statistics show crime dropped in the country last year, including violent offenses.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said as he presented an annual crime report on Tuesday that "every crime is one too many, but objectively, this is the lowest level in decades."
Police agencies recorded more than 5.6 million cases in 2018, 3.6 percent fewer than in 2017. They included 185,377 violent crimes, a 1.9 percent decrease from the year before.
Despite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.
The overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent. The clearance rate for solved murder and manslaughter cases was 96.1%.

Officers checked students entering the school in Flensburg, just south of the Danish border, on Wednesday morning and detained the German teenager. Police said initial investigations firmed up suspicions against him, without elaborating. The chat surfaced on Tuesday evening and the threat applied to Wednesday.
Lessons were held as normal after boy was detained.


Germany extends African missions another year
BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s Cabinet has approved extending Germany\'s military missions in Africa for another year.
The dpa news agency reported Wednesday that that includes German troops taking part in a European Union training mission in Mali known as EUTM, and the United Nations "Minusma" peacekeeping force there.
Dpa reports the Cabinet also plans to extend Germany\'s commitment to the EU\'s anti-piracy mission Atalanta that operates off the Horn of Africa, but to reduce its maximum troop numbers from 600 to 400. There are currently 80 troops taking part.
Germany currently has some 180 troops involved in the EUTM mission, with a maximum of 350. A further 900 are in Mali and Niger as part of the Minusma force, with a maximum of 1,100.
Those troop commitments are to remain unchanged.


Germany says emissions dropped in 2018 amid warm weather
BERLIN (AP) — The German government says greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2% in 2018, the first major decrease in four years.
Estimates published Tuesday by the Environment Ministry show Germany released the equivalent of 868.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, 38 million less than 2017.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Germany benefited from 2018\'s warm and sunny weather, which increased production of renewable energy and reduced the need for heating fuel.
Germany\'s emissions last year were about 30.6 percent lower than in 1990. The country aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent from that baseline year by 2030 as part of efforts to curb climate change.
Cabinet is debating a bill that could set legally binding emissions goals for each sector of the economy.


Germany: 70-year-old babysitter guilty of killing boy
BERLIN (AP) — A court in Germany has found a 70-year-old babysitter guilty of manslaughter for the killing of a 7-year-old boy she was looking after.
Judges at the regional court in the southwestern city of Heilbronn sentenced the woman Monday to 10 years and six months in prison.
The trained nurse, who had been the boy\'s babysitter for several years and who he called "Grandma Elisabeth," had strangled the child while he was staying the night at her home.
Judges rejected the defense lawyer\'s arguments that his client, whose full name wasn\'t released because of German privacy rules, had killed the boy by accident, though they did take into consideration that she might have been suffering from depression and been overwhelmed by stress.

BERLIN (AP) — German government statistics show crime dropped in the country last year, including violent offenses.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said as he presented an annual crime report on Tuesday that "every crime is one too many, but objectively, this is the lowest level in decades."
Police agencies recorded more than 5.6 million cases in 2018, 3.6 percent fewer than in 2017. They included 185,377 violent crimes, a 1.9 percent decrease from the year before.
Despite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.
The overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent. The clearance rate for solved murder and manslaughter cases was 96.1%.


Germany indicts suspected rebel over Sri Lanka war crimes
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have indicted a Sri Lankan man suspected of involvement in killing 15 captured government soldiers while fighting for the Tamil Tigers rebel group.
Federal prosecutors said Friday that 37-year-old Sivatheeban B. is accused of membership in a foreign terrorist organization, war crimes, two cases of manslaughter and 11 cases of attempted manslaughter.
The man, whose surname wasn\'t released due to German privacy rules, was arrested in August.
Prosecutors allege that in 2008 the suspect guarded 15 captured soldiers as they were driven to a site where they were executed, and later helped burn their bodies. In a separate incident a year later, he fired on 13 soldiers, two of whom died.
The rebel group, which fought for a separate state for ethnic minority Tamils, was defeated in 2009.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel has received former U.S. President Barack Obama at her office in Berlin for a meeting characterized by German officials as a routine private encounter with a former international peer.
Obama could be seen waving as he left the chancellery alongside Merkel Friday. Merkel\'s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she has met repeatedly with ex-heads of state and government "with whom she worked together closely and well for a time."
He said the meeting has no implications for current German-U.S. relations. Asked whether it was a signal to President Donald Trump, with whom Germany has a sometimes-complicated relationship, Seibert replied: "I would firmly reject that impression."
Merkel and Obama have already met in Berlin since the former president left office, participating in a discussion at a May 2017 conference.


Germany raids groups suspected of supporting Hamas
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have carried out raids on groups suspected of helping the militant Palestinian group Hamas under the guise of providing humanitarian aid.
The interior ministry said some 90 properties across Germany associated with an "Islamist network" were searched on Wednesday. It said the network was headed by two groups based in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, WWR Help and Ansaar International.
The ministry said there are indications that the network provided financial and propaganda support to Hamas, a longtime enemy of Israel that runs the Gaza Strip and was listed as a terror group by the European Union in 2001.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that "anyone who supports Hamas under the cover of humanitarian aid flouts fundamental value judgments of our constitution."


Germany charges Afghan man with war crimes
BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they\'ve charged a 26-year-old former Afghan officer with war crimes for allegedly abusing prisoners and defiling the corpse of a man he boasted he\'d "killed like a donkey."
Ahmad Zaheer D., whose last name wasn\'t given in line with privacy laws, is accused of shaking two prisoners by the hair during an interrogation around late 2013 and punching one, while another soldier hit a third with a hose.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that the suspect brought the corpse of a high-ranking enemy commander into a town in March 2014, telling villagers he\'d killed him and putting a meat hook into the corpse\'s head, then stringing the body up with a rope.
He was arrested Oct. 25 near Munich. It wasn\'t clear when he came to Germany.


Germany indicts Indian couple with spying on Sikh opposition
BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they have indicted two Indian citizens for spying on the Sikh opposition and Kashmiri separatists in Germany.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that 50-year-old Manmohan S. is accused of providing information to India\'s foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, from January 2015 onward.
His wife, 51-year-old Kanwal Jit K., allegedly also began cooperating with the spy agency starting in July 2017. Their full names weren\'t released due to German privacy rules.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.
Affordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\'t think that is the right solution. He said "the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available."
Andres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a "false solution."


Germany mulls new rules to boost organ donations
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s health minister is launching a drive to tackle a shortage of donor organs with a reform that would make most people potential organ donors unless they object.
At present, doctors in Germany can transplant organs only from people who actively register and carry a donor card. Under the new system proposed Monday by Health Minister Jens Spahn and cross-party supporters, people would automatically be considered as donors unless they opt out by putting themselves on a register saying they object — which they could do at any time.
Relatives could also tell officials that the deceased made clear they didn\'t want to donate.
Spahn said 20 other European Union countries have similar systems and "everything we have tried so far hasn\'t led to a rise in donor figures."

Ex-PS gets passport back for meeting in Germany
Former ICT principal secretary Sammy Itemere. FILE PHOTO | NMG
Former ICT principal secretary Sammy Itemere, who is being tried over the theft of Sh122 million from the government, has been allowed to attend a rotary meeting in Germany.
Mr Itemere, charged alongside Lugari MP Ayub Savula and his two wives, was given back his passport to enable him travel to Hamburg by Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi after an application by his lawyer John Manasses.
Mr Andayi allowed Mr Itemere to retain the passport until June 7, 2019 when he will return it to the court where it is held as a pre-bail condition.
Mr Manasses said Mr Itemere was recently employed as an Associate Director by the Frexon Marketting Agencies.
The Savulas are charged with defrauding the government of Sh122,335,500 saying could offer magazine advertisement. Mr Itemere has denied abuse of office charges by allegedly authorising payments to Mr Savula\xe2\x80\x99s firms.

April 8 (UPI) -- Rheinmetall was awarded a $122.8 million contract to supply Germany\'s Bundeswehr with artillery shells for five years.
The contract will include 32,000 rounds of ammunition with an option of 11,000 more worth $41.7 million, the German-based company announced Monday.
Delivery is scheduled to begin later this year.
Rheinmetall Waffe Munition will manufacture the 155mm DM-121 artillery ammunition in Unterlub.
The company previously delivered 30,000 shells in 2009.
The ammunition can attain a range of up to 18.6 miles when fired from the PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzer and land 85 percent of the time within an area the size of a soccer field.
The explosive round also can be used in training operations and field exercises.
"The insensitive explosive not only produces a devastating effect on and in the target, but also protects friendly forces if the ammunition is hit by hostile fire or exposed to other forms of mechanical stress, etc.," the company said.
The DM121 is capable of penetrating a wall of reinforced concrete several feet deep before detonating on the opposite side.
It is designed to operate in temperatures ranging from minus 46 degrees F to 145 degrees F.
Last month, the German Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment awarded a $337.8 million contract to Krauss-Maffei Wegmann to upgrade 101 Leopard 2 main battle tanks by 2026.

BERLIN (AP) — German government statistics show crime dropped in the country last year, including violent offenses.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said as he presented an annual crime report on Tuesday that "every crime is one too many, but objectively, this is the lowest level in decades."
Police agencies recorded more than 5.6 million cases in 2018, 3.6 percent fewer than in 2017. They included 185,377 violent crimes, a 1.9 percent decrease from the year before.
Despite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.
The overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent. The clearance rate for solved murder and manslaughter cases was 96.1%.


Germany indicts Indian couple with spying on Sikh opposition
BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they have indicted two Indian citizens for spying on the Sikh opposition and Kashmiri separatists in Germany.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that 50-year-old Manmohan S. is accused of providing information to India\'s foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, from January 2015 onward.
His wife, 51-year-old Kanwal Jit K., allegedly also began cooperating with the spy agency starting in July 2017. Their full names weren\'t released due to German privacy rules.
Prosecutors said the couple is accused of receiving a total of 7,200 euros (about $8,100) for the information they provided to their handler, who was stationed in Germany.


Germany raids groups suspected of supporting Hamas
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have carried out raids on groups suspected of helping the militant Palestinian group Hamas under the guise of providing humanitarian aid.
The interior ministry said some 90 properties across Germany associated with an "Islamist network" were searched on Wednesday. It said the network was headed by two groups based in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, WWR Help and Ansaar International.
The ministry said there are indications that the network provided financial and propaganda support to Hamas, a longtime enemy of Israel that runs the Gaza Strip and was listed as a terror group by the European Union in 2001.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that "anyone who supports Hamas under the cover of humanitarian aid flouts fundamental value judgments of our constitution."

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.
Affordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\'t think that is the right solution. He said "the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available."
Andres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a "false solution."


Sea-Eye asks Germany to help find port for 64 migrants
MILAN (AP) — The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says it is asking Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a safe port for the 64 migrants it rescued off Libya earlier this week.
Sea-Watch spokesman Carlotta Weibl said Friday that the rescue boat Alan Kurdi remains in international waters off Lampedusa and will not approach Italy\'s southernmost island until it has permission.
She said conditions on board were worsening and that a storm was approaching. She said a request has been made to the German foreign ministry to find a solution.
Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers to pack unseaworthy rubber dinghies with migrants looking for sanctuary in Europe.

A British Airways flight bound to D\xc3\xbcsseldorf, Germany, from London accidentally landed in Edinburgh, Scotland, instead, 525 miles from where it should have been.
British Airways said in a statement to Business Insider that the plane ended up in Edinburgh after the flight
after the plane landed, the BBC reported .
"We have apologised to customers for this interruption to their journey and will be contacting them all individually," British Airways\' statement said.
German firm WDL Aviation ran the flight - which left London\'s City Airport - for British Airways. British Airways said it was working with WDL to work out how the wrong flight plan was filed. The flight has now landed at D\xc3\xbcsseldorf International Airport, its original destination.
WDL Aviation told Business Insider: "We are working closely with the authorities to investigate how the obviously unfortunate mix-up of flight schedules could occur. At no time has the safety of passengers been compromised."
A passenger named Son Tran tweeted about the flight after it landed and asked for an explanation, describing it as a "mystery travel lottery."
He responded to British Airway\'s official account after it said the flight was diverted, and said it felt like an "honest mistake rather than a diversion" at the time.
and that the crew was trying to work out what we could do," Sophie Cooke, a passenger on the flight, told the BBC.

"When a brutal dictatorship arose in Europe, the world failed to respond. Millions of lives were lost in the Second World War. So the United States is calling on the United Nations to live up to its very purpose. Reject the failed leadership of Nicolas Maduro."
US Vice President Mike Pence compared Venezuela\'s government with that of Nazi Germany, arguing that the failure of the international community to take the US\' side could lead to genocide. Pence told a UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday:
In a now-routine show of support for Venezuelan opposition leader and self-declared interim president Juan Guaido,
The vice president then echoed a threat oft-repeated by Trump administration officials: "All options are on the table" when it comes to removing Maduro from power.
Russia\'s ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, shot back at Pence.Nebenzya said,
Nebenzya slammed US sanctions on Venezuela, which he said have exacerbated the country\'s precarious economic condition, and
Wednesday\'s meeting was convened to discuss the deepening humanitarian crisis in Venezuela.A separate report by Human Rights Watch, released last week, recommends that the UN lead a full-scale emergency response to address the "health and food crises" in the socialist state.
Despite the US\' international pressure campaign - marked by alternating promises of aid and veiled threats of force - Maduro remains firmly in control in Venezuela. At Wednesday\'s session, Nebenzya once again called for diplomatic discussions to resolve the power struggle in Caracas.

Germans with a second nationality who fight abroad for groups like ISIS will lose their citizenship, the cabinet agreed in a draft law on Wednesday intended to deter future militants.
Like other Western countries, Germany faces a conundrum of how to deal with citizens who travel to the Middle East to join violent extremist causes like ISIS, whose self-proclaimed “caliphate” was eliminated last month.
The measure, which needs parliamentary approval, would exclude minors, cover only future cases, and not apply to single nationality Germans who could otherwise be left stateless.
“This will send a signal to ISIS supporters, to those thinking of traveling to ISIS areas,” government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters.
More than 1,000 Germans have left their country for Middle East war zones since 2013 and the government has been debating how to deal with them as US-backed forces took ISIS\' last patch of territory in Syria and rounded up prisoners.
About a third have returned to Germany, another third are believed to have died, and the rest are thought to be still in Iraq and Syria, including those detained by Iraqi forces and US-backed fighters in Syria, according to German intelligence officials.
In February, US President Donald Trump urged Britain, France, and Germany to take back more than 800 captured ISIS fighters and put them on trial.
Germany said it would take back fighters only if the suspects have consular access, adding that in principle, all of its citizens and those suspected of having fought for ISIS have the right to return.
In one high-profile case, Britain in February revoked the citizenship of a teenager who had left London aged 15 to join ISIS in Syria. The case of Shamima Begum highlighted the security, legal, and ethical dilemmas facing European governments dealing with those who swore allegiance to a group determined to destroy the West.
Germany joined the military campaign against ISIS militants in Syria in a support role by deploying Tornado reconnaissance jets, refueling aircraft, and a frigate to the region, after an appeal from close partner France for Berlin to do more.

An Indian married couple accused of spying on Germany’s Sikh community and Kashmir movement have been charged with espionage, German prosecutors announced on Tuesday.
They named the suspects only as 50-year-old Manmohan S. and his wife Kanwal Jit K., 51, in keeping with German privacy rules for defendants.
“Manmohan S. agreed by January 2015 at the latest to provide information about Germany’s Sikh community and Kashmir movement and their relatives to an employee of the Indian foreign intelligence service Research & Analysis Wing,” they said in a statement.
His wife joined him in monthly meetings with the Indian intelligence officer between July and December 2017, and in total the couple were paid 7,200 euros ($8,100) for their work.
The charges, which can carry up to 10 years’ jail in serious cases, were laid on March 28 but only publicized Tuesday by the federal prosecution service in the city of Karlsruhe.

Germany protests to Brunei envoy over anti-gay law plans
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s Foreign Ministry has protested Brunei\'s plans to implement Islamic criminal laws that punishes gay sex by stoning offenders to death.
In a statement Tuesday, the ministry said German diplomats expressed concern at the introduction of Sharia law penalties and appealed to Brunei\'s ambassador Monday to "abide by existing international human rights obligations."
The legal change in the tiny, oil-rich monarchy, which also includes amputation for theft, is due to come into force Wednesday.
Human rights group Amnesty International has slammed the punishments as "vicious ."
American actor George Clooney, who is married to prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, called recently for a boycott of luxury hotels in Europe and the United States linked to Brunei\'s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.


Germany: teen with knives detained after school threat
BERLIN (AP) — Police in northern Germany say they have detained a 17-year-old boy with several knives after being tipped off to an online chat in which someone threatened to kill several people at a school.
Officers checked students entering the school in Flensburg, just south of the Danish border, on Wednesday morning and detained the German teenager. Police said initial investigations firmed up suspicions against him, without elaborating. The chat surfaced on Tuesday evening and the threat applied to Wednesday.
Lessons were held as normal after boy was detained.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel has received former U.S. President Barack Obama at her office in Berlin for a meeting characterized by German officials as a routine private encounter with a former international peer.
Obama could be seen waving as he left the chancellery alongside Merkel Friday. Merkel\'s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she has met repeatedly with ex-heads of state and government "with whom she worked together closely and well for a time."
He said the meeting has no implications for current German-U.S. relations. Asked whether it was a signal to President Donald Trump, with whom Germany has a sometimes-complicated relationship, Seibert replied: "I would firmly reject that impression."
Merkel and Obama have already met in Berlin since the former president left office, participating in a discussion at a May 2017 conference.

BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s environment minister says the government will discuss introducing a carbon tax as part of its national plan to curb climate change.
Speaking after the first meeting of a special "climate Cabinet," German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Wednesday that government ministers would, over the coming months, put forward proposals for cutting greenhouse gases in the areas they oversee.
Germany\'s transport ministry opposes sector-specific targets, but Schulze insisted "everyone will have to shoulder some of the responsibility."
She also displayed openness to some kind of carbon tax. Other countries have already introduced carbon pricing to discourage the burning of fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases and stoke global warming.
Schulze said of such carbon taxes that "there are many different models that will also be debated in Cabinet."

Germany says emissions dropped in 2018 amid warm weather
BERLIN (AP) — The German government says greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2% in 2018, the first major decrease in four years.
Estimates published Tuesday by the Environment Ministry show Germany released the equivalent of 868.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, 38 million less than 2017.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Germany benefited from 2018\'s warm and sunny weather, which increased production of renewable energy and reduced the need for heating fuel.
Germany\'s emissions last year were about 30.6 percent lower than in 1990. The country aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent from that baseline year by 2030 as part of efforts to curb climate change.
Cabinet is debating a bill that could set legally binding emissions goals for each sector of the economy.


Germany extends African missions another year
BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s Cabinet has approved extending Germany\'s military missions in Africa for another year.
The dpa news agency reported Wednesday that that includes German troops taking part in a European Union training mission in Mali known as EUTM, and the United Nations "Minusma" peacekeeping force there.
Dpa reports the Cabinet also plans to extend Germany\'s commitment to the EU\'s anti-piracy mission Atalanta that operates off the Horn of Africa, but to reduce its maximum troop numbers from 600 to 400. There are currently 80 troops taking part.
Germany currently has some 180 troops involved in the EUTM mission, with a maximum of 350. A further 900 are in Mali and Niger as part of the Minusma force, with a maximum of 1,100.
Those troop commitments are to remain unchanged.


Germany mulls new rules to boost organ donations
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s health minister is launching a drive to tackle a shortage of donor organs with a reform that would make most people potential organ donors unless they object.
At present, doctors in Germany can transplant organs only from people who actively register and carry a donor card. Under the new system proposed Monday by Health Minister Jens Spahn and cross-party supporters, people would automatically be considered as donors unless they opt out by putting themselves on a register saying they object — which they could do at any time.
Relatives could also tell officials that the deceased made clear they didn\'t want to donate.
Spahn said 20 other European Union countries have similar systems and "everything we have tried so far hasn\'t led to a rise in donor figures."

Police agencies recorded more than 5.6 million cases in 2018, 3.6 percent fewer than in 2017. They included 185,377 violent crimes, a 1.9 percent decrease from the year before.
Despite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.
The overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent. The clearance rate for solved murder and manslaughter cases was 96.1%.


Germany: 70-year-old babysitter guilty of killing boy
BERLIN (AP) — A court in Germany has found a 70-year-old babysitter guilty of manslaughter for the killing of a 7-year-old boy she was looking after.
Judges at the regional court in the southwestern city of Heilbronn sentenced the woman Monday to 10 years and six months in prison.
The trained nurse, who had been the boy\'s babysitter for several years and who he called "Grandma Elisabeth," had strangled the child while he was staying the night at her home.
Judges rejected the defense lawyer\'s arguments that his client, whose full name wasn\'t released because of German privacy rules, had killed the boy by accident, though they did take into consideration that she might have been suffering from depression and been overwhelmed by stress.

Germany charges Afghan man with war crimes
BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they\'ve charged a 26-year-old former Afghan officer with war crimes for allegedly abusing prisoners and defiling the corpse of a man he boasted he\'d "killed like a donkey."
Ahmad Zaheer D., whose last name wasn\'t given in line with privacy laws, is accused of shaking two prisoners by the hair during an interrogation around late 2013 and punching one, while another soldier hit a third with a hose.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that the suspect brought the corpse of a high-ranking enemy commander into a town in March 2014, telling villagers he\'d killed him and putting a meat hook into the corpse\'s head, then stringing the body up with a rope.
He was arrested Oct. 25 near Munich. It wasn\'t clear when he came to Germany.


Germany indicts suspected rebel over Sri Lanka war crimes
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have indicted a Sri Lankan man suspected of involvement in killing 15 captured government soldiers while fighting for the Tamil Tigers rebel group.
Federal prosecutors said Friday that 37-year-old Sivatheeban B. is accused of membership in a foreign terrorist organization, war crimes, two cases of manslaughter and 11 cases of attempted manslaughter.
The man, whose surname wasn\'t released due to German privacy rules, was arrested in August.
Prosecutors allege that in 2008 the suspect guarded 15 captured soldiers as they were driven to a site where they were executed, and later helped burn their bodies. In a separate incident a year later, he fired on 13 soldiers, two of whom died.
The rebel group, which fought for a separate state for ethnic minority Tamils, was defeated in 2009.

BERLIN (AP) — German government statistics show crime dropped in the country last year, including violent offenses.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said as he presented an annual crime report on Tuesday that "every crime is one too many, but objectively, this is the lowest level in decades."
Police agencies recorded more than 5.6 million cases in 2018, 3.6 percent fewer than in 2017. They included 185,377 violent crimes, a 1.9 percent decrease from the year before.
Despite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.
The overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent. The clearance rate for solved murder and manslaughter cases was 96.1%.


Germany mulls new rules to boost organ donations
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s health minister is launching a drive to tackle a shortage of donor organs with a reform that would make most people potential organ donors unless they object.
At present, doctors in Germany can transplant organs only from people who actively register and carry a donor card. Under the new system proposed Monday by Health Minister Jens Spahn and cross-party supporters, people would automatically be considered as donors unless they opt out by putting themselves on a register saying they object — which they could do at any time.
Relatives could also tell officials that the deceased made clear they didn\'t want to donate.
Spahn said 20 other European Union countries have similar systems and "everything we have tried so far hasn\'t led to a rise in donor figures."

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel has received former U.S. President Barack Obama at her office in Berlin for a meeting characterized by German officials as a routine private encounter with a former international peer.
Obama could be seen waving as he left the chancellery alongside Merkel Friday. Merkel\'s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she has met repeatedly with ex-heads of state and government "with whom she worked together closely and well for a time."
He said the meeting has no implications for current German-U.S. relations. Asked whether it was a signal to President Donald Trump, with whom Germany has a sometimes-complicated relationship, Seibert replied: "I would firmly reject that impression."
Merkel and Obama have already met in Berlin since the former president left office, participating in a discussion at a May 2017 conference.

BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s environment minister says the government will discuss introducing a carbon tax as part of its national plan to curb climate change.
Speaking after the first meeting of a special "climate Cabinet," German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Wednesday that government ministers would, over the coming months, put forward proposals for cutting greenhouse gases in the areas they oversee.
Germany\'s transport ministry opposes sector-specific targets, but Schulze insisted "everyone will have to shoulder some of the responsibility."
She also displayed openness to some kind of carbon tax. Other countries have already introduced carbon pricing to discourage the burning of fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases and stoke global warming.
Schulze said of such carbon taxes that "there are many different models that will also be debated in Cabinet."

Germany: 70-year-old babysitter guilty of killing boy
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — A court in Germany has found a 70-year-old babysitter guilty of manslaughter for the killing of a 7-year-old boy she was looking after.
Judges at the regional court in the southwestern city of Heilbronn sentenced the woman Monday to 10 years and six months in prison.
The trained nurse, who had been the boy\'s babysitter for several years and who he called "Grandma Elisabeth," had strangled the child while he was staying the night at her home.
Judges rejected the defense lawyer\'s arguments that his client, whose full name wasn\'t released because of German privacy rules, had killed the boy by accident, though they did take into consideration that she might have been suffering from depression and been overwhelmed by stress.


Germany says emissions dropped in 2018 amid warm weather
BERLIN (AP) — The German government says greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2% in 2018, the first major decrease in four years.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
Estimates published Tuesday by the Environment Ministry show Germany released the equivalent of 868.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, 38 million less than 2017.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Germany benefited from 2018\'s warm and sunny weather, which increased production of renewable energy and reduced the need for heating fuel.
Germany\'s emissions last year were about 30.6 percent lower than in 1990. The country aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent from that baseline year by 2030 as part of efforts to curb climate change.
Cabinet is debating a bill that could set legally binding emissions goals for each sector of the economy.


Germany protests to Brunei envoy over anti-gay law plans
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s Foreign Ministry has protested Brunei\'s plans to implement Islamic criminal laws that punishes gay sex by stoning offenders to death.
\r
\t\t \r

\r
\t\r
In a statement Tuesday, the ministry said German diplomats expressed concern at the introduction of Sharia law penalties and appealed to Brunei\'s ambassador Monday to "abide by existing international human rights obligations."
The legal change in the tiny, oil-rich monarchy, which also includes amputation for theft, is due to come into force Wednesday.
Human rights group Amnesty International has slammed the punishments as "vicious ."
American actor George Clooney, who is married to prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, called recently for a boycott of luxury hotels in Europe and the United States linked to Brunei\'s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.

BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they have indicted two Indian citizens for spying on the Sikh opposition and Kashmiri separatists in Germany.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that 50-year-old Manmohan S. is accused of providing information to India\'s foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, from January 2015 onward.
His wife, 51-year-old Kanwal Jit K., allegedly also began cooperating with the spy agency starting in July 2017. Their full names weren\'t released due to German privacy rules.
Prosecutors said the couple is accused of receiving a total of 7,200 euros (about $8,100) for the information they provided to their handler, who was stationed in Germany.

Germany raids groups suspected of supporting Hamas

\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have carried out raids on groups suspected of helping the militant Palestinian group Hamas under the guise of providing humanitarian aid.
The interior ministry said some 90 properties across Germany associated with an "Islamist network" were searched on Wednesday. It said the network was headed by two groups based in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, WWR Help and Ansaar International.
The ministry said there are indications that the network provided financial and propaganda support to Hamas, a longtime enemy of Israel that runs the Gaza Strip and was listed as a terror group by the European Union in 2001.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that "anyone who supports Hamas under the cover of humanitarian aid flouts fundamental value judgments of our constitution."


Sea-Eye asks Germany to help find port for 64 migrants

MILAN (AP) — The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says it is asking Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a safe port for the 64 migrants it rescued off Libya earlier this week.
Sea-Watch spokesman Carlotta Weibl said Friday that the rescue boat Alan Kurdi remains in international waters off Lampedusa and will not approach Italy\'s southernmost island until it has permission.
She said conditions on board were worsening and that a storm was approaching. She said a request has been made to the German foreign ministry to find a solution.
Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers to pack unseaworthy rubber dinghies with migrants looking for sanctuary in Europe.


Germany extends African missions another year
BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s Cabinet has approved extending Germany\'s military missions in Africa for another year.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
The dpa news agency reported Wednesday that that includes German troops taking part in a European Union training mission in Mali known as EUTM, and the United Nations "Minusma" peacekeeping force there.
Dpa reports the Cabinet also plans to extend Germany\'s commitment to the EU\'s anti-piracy mission Atalanta that operates off the Horn of Africa, but to reduce its maximum troop numbers from 600 to 400. There are currently 80 troops taking part.
Germany currently has some 180 troops involved in the EUTM mission, with a maximum of 350. A further 900 are in Mali and Niger as part of the Minusma force, with a maximum of 1,100.
Those troop commitments are to remain unchanged.

Lessons were held as normal after boy was detained.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.
Affordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\'t think that is the right solution. He said "the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available."
Andres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a "false solution."

BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s health minister on Monday launched a drive to tackle a shortage of donor organs with a reform that would make most people potential organ donors unless they object.
\t
\t
At present, doctors in Germany can transplant organs only from people who actively declare their willingness, for example by carrying a donor card or making a living will. Around 2,000 people in the country of 80 million die each year while waiting for transplants.
\t
Under the new system proposed Monday by Health Minister Jens Spahn and a cross-party group of supporters, people would automatically be considered as donors unless they opt out by putting themselves on a register saying they object — which they could do at any time.
\t
Relatives could also tell officials that the deceased made clear they didn\'t want to donate. Everyone aged 16 and over would be informed repeatedly of the new system, while there would be no donations by people who aren\'t in a position to grasp the significance of the decision, for example because of mental disability.
\t
Spahn said 20 out of 28 European Union countries have similar systems and "everything we have tried so far hasn\'t led to a rise in donor figures."
\t
"We still have about 10 times more people on the waiting list for an organ than the number that are transplanted," said Karl Lauterbach, a health policy expert with the center-left Social Democrats. Last year, there were some 9,400 people on the waiting list and well under 1,000 transplants, while about 2,000 people on the waiting list die each year, he said.
\t
Germany\'s parliament is expected eventually to hold a free vote on new rules.
\t
Another cross-party group of lawmakers is calling for people to be regularly asked about their intentions and an online register of donors. The group says it wants to ensure that organ donation remains "a conscious and voluntary decision that cannot be forced by the state."

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel has received former U.S. President Barack Obama at her office in Berlin for a meeting characterized by German officials as a routine private encounter with a former international peer.
\t
\t
Obama could be seen waving as he left the chancellery alongside Merkel Friday. Merkel\'s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she has met repeatedly with ex-heads of state and government "with whom she worked together closely and well for a time."
\t
\t
He said the meeting has no implications for current German-U.S. relations. Asked whether it was a signal to President Donald Trump, with whom Germany has a sometimes-complicated relationship, Seibert replied: "I would firmly reject that impression."
\t
Merkel and Obama have already met in Berlin since the former president left office, participating in a discussion at a May 2017 conference.


\t
BERLIN (AP) — The German government says greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2% in 2018, the first major decrease in four years.
\t
Estimates published Tuesday by the Environment Ministry show Germany released the equivalent of 868.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, 38 million less than 2017.
\t
\t
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Germany benefited from 2018\'s warm and sunny weather, which increased production of renewable energy and reduced the need for heating fuel.
\t
Germany\'s emissions last year were about 30.6 percent lower than in 1990. The country aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent from that baseline year by 2030 as part of efforts to curb climate change.
\t
Cabinet is debating a bill that could set legally binding emissions goals for each sector of the economy.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s Cabinet has approved extending Germany\'s military missions in Africa for another year.
\t
The dpa news agency reported Wednesday that that includes German troops taking part in a European Union training mission in Mali known as EUTM, and the United Nations "Minusma" peacekeeping force there.
\t
\t
Dpa reports the Cabinet also plans to extend Germany\'s commitment to the EU\'s anti-piracy mission Atalanta that operates off the Horn of Africa, but to reduce its maximum troop numbers from 600 to 400. There are currently 80 troops taking part.

Germany raids groups suspected of supporting Hamas
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have carried out raids on groups suspected of helping the militant Palestinian group Hamas under the guise of providing humanitarian aid.
The interior ministry said some 90 properties across Germany associated with an "Islamist network" were searched on Wednesday. It said the network was headed by two groups based in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, WWR Help and Ansaar International.
The ministry said there are indications that the network provided financial and propaganda support to Hamas, a longtime enemy of Israel that runs the Gaza Strip and was listed as a terror group by the European Union in 2001.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that "anyone who supports Hamas under the cover of humanitarian aid flouts fundamental value judgments of our constitution."


Sea-Eye asks Germany to help find port for 64 migrants
MILAN (AP) — The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says it is asking Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a safe port for the 64 migrants it rescued off Libya earlier this week.
Sea-Watch spokesman Carlotta Weibl said Friday that the rescue boat Alan Kurdi remains in international waters off Lampedusa and will not approach Italy\'s southernmost island until it has permission.
She said conditions on board were worsening and that a storm was approaching. She said a request has been made to the German foreign ministry to find a solution.
Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers to pack unseaworthy rubber dinghies with migrants looking for sanctuary in Europe.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.
Affordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\'t think that is the right solution. He said "the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available."
Andres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a "false solution."


Germany charges Afghan man with war crimes
BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they\'ve charged a 26-year-old former Afghan officer with war crimes for allegedly abusing prisoners and defiling the corpse of a man he boasted he\'d "killed like a donkey."
Ahmad Zaheer D., whose last name wasn\'t given in line with privacy laws, is accused of shaking two prisoners by the hair during an interrogation around late 2013 and punching one, while another soldier hit a third with a hose.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that the suspect brought the corpse of a high-ranking enemy commander into a town in March 2014, telling villagers he\'d killed him and putting a meat hook into the corpse\'s head, then stringing the body up with a rope.
He was arrested Oct. 25 near Munich. It wasn\'t clear when he came to Germany.


Germany mulls new rules to boost organ donations
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s health minister is launching a drive to tackle a shortage of donor organs with a reform that would make most people potential organ donors unless they object.
At present, doctors in Germany can transplant organs only from people who actively register and carry a donor card. Under the new system proposed Monday by Health Minister Jens Spahn and cross-party supporters, people would automatically be considered as donors unless they opt out by putting themselves on a register saying they object — which they could do at any time.
Relatives could also tell officials that the deceased made clear they didn\'t want to donate.
Spahn said 20 other European Union countries have similar systems and "everything we have tried so far hasn\'t led to a rise in donor figures."

Germany: teen with knives detained after school threat
BERLIN (AP) — Police in northern Germany say they have detained a 17-year-old boy with several knives after being tipped off to an online chat in which someone threatened to kill several people at a school.
Officers checked students entering the school in Flensburg, just south of the Danish border, on Wednesday morning and detained the German teenager. Police said initial investigations firmed up suspicions against him, without elaborating. The chat surfaced on Tuesday evening and the threat applied to Wednesday.
Lessons were held as normal after boy was detained.


Germany indicts Indian couple with spying on Sikh opposition
BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they have indicted two Indian citizens for spying on the Sikh opposition and Kashmiri separatists in Germany.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that 50-year-old Manmohan S. is accused of providing information to India\'s foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, from January 2015 onward.
His wife, 51-year-old Kanwal Jit K., allegedly also began cooperating with the spy agency starting in July 2017. Their full names weren\'t released due to German privacy rules.
Prosecutors said the couple is accused of receiving a total of 7,200 euros (about $8,100) for the information they provided to their handler, who was stationed in Germany.

BERLIN (AP) — German government statistics show crime dropped in the country last year, including violent offenses.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said as he presented an annual crime report on Tuesday that "every crime is one too many, but objectively, this is the lowest level in decades."
Police agencies recorded more than 5.6 million cases in 2018, 3.6 percent fewer than in 2017. They included 185,377 violent crimes, a 1.9 percent decrease from the year before.
Despite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.
The overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent. The clearance rate for solved murder and manslaughter cases was 96.1%.

BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s environment minister says the government will discuss introducing a carbon tax as part of its national plan to curb climate change.
Speaking after the first meeting of a special "climate Cabinet," German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Wednesday that government ministers would, over the coming months, put forward proposals for cutting greenhouse gases in the areas they oversee.
Germany\'s transport ministry opposes sector-specific targets, but Schulze insisted "everyone will have to shoulder some of the responsibility."
She also displayed openness to some kind of carbon tax. Other countries have already introduced carbon pricing to discourage the burning of fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases and stoke global warming.
Schulze said of such carbon taxes that "there are many different models that will also be debated in Cabinet."


Germany: 70-year-old babysitter guilty of killing boy
BERLIN (AP) — A court in Germany has found a 70-year-old babysitter guilty of manslaughter for the killing of a 7-year-old boy she was looking after.
Judges at the regional court in the southwestern city of Heilbronn sentenced the woman Monday to 10 years and six months in prison.
The trained nurse, who had been the boy\'s babysitter for several years and who he called "Grandma Elisabeth," had strangled the child while he was staying the night at her home.
Judges rejected the defense lawyer\'s arguments that his client, whose full name wasn\'t released because of German privacy rules, had killed the boy by accident, though they did take into consideration that she might have been suffering from depression and been overwhelmed by stress.


Germany indicts suspected rebel over Sri Lanka war crimes
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have indicted a Sri Lankan man suspected of involvement in killing 15 captured government soldiers while fighting for the Tamil Tigers rebel group.
Federal prosecutors said Friday that 37-year-old Sivatheeban B. is accused of membership in a foreign terrorist organization, war crimes, two cases of manslaughter and 11 cases of attempted manslaughter.
The man, whose surname wasn\'t released due to German privacy rules, was arrested in August.
Prosecutors allege that in 2008 the suspect guarded 15 captured soldiers as they were driven to a site where they were executed, and later helped burn their bodies. In a separate incident a year later, he fired on 13 soldiers, two of whom died.
The rebel group, which fought for a separate state for ethnic minority Tamils, was defeated in 2009.


\t\t\t\t\t\t
Another pollution scandal is threatening to rock the European auto industry. On Friday, EU anti-trust regulators charged BMW, Volkswagen (Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche), and Daimler, the so-called “Big Five,” in a preliminary review with colluding to block the roll-out of clean emissions technology in what media has called the latest pollution scandal to hit the auto industry. The European Commission (EC) said it had sent statements of objections to the German automakers setting out the charges which come almost two years after carrying out dawn raids at their premises.
The EC said the collusion occurred between 2006 to 2014 and took place during technical meetings held by the “circle of five,” which included BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen Group’s VW, Audi and Porsche. “Daimler, VW, and BMW may have broken EU competition rules. As a result, European consumers may have been denied the opportunity to buy cars with the best available technology,” said European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager in a statement. She added that companies can cooperate in many ways to improve the quality of their products. However, EU competition rules do not allow them to collude on exactly the opposite.
European law enforcers first carried out inspections at the premises of BMW, Daimler, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany in October 2017, as part of its initial inquiries into possible collusion between car manufacturers on the technological development of passenger cars. The Commission opened an in-depth investigation in September 2018.
Simply not good enough
The auto manufacturers have been given 10 weeks to respond, with potential fines of up to 10 percent of global revenue possible. BMW said it will contest charges “with all legal means if necessary,” adding that it was probable the EC would issue a significant fine and it would set aside a provision of likely more than 1 billion euros ($1.125 billion), which would hurt its first-quarter earnings. VW has yet to make an official comment, confirming only that it has received notice from the antitrust regulator. Daimler, which tipped off the EC, says it does not believe it will be fined as a result of its information. Related: Aramco’s Mega Debt Deal Is A Raging Success
The executive director of the European Federation of Transport and Environment, William Todts, said on Friday that issuing fines is simply not good enough. “It would be indefensible if the German car industry colluded to fit useless emissions controls, as the allegations indicate. That would mean Europeans were breathing poisonous air that should have been avoided. The EU must fine colluding companies but it mustn’t stop there. We need to clean up the 43 million dirty diesel that are on our streets today,” he said.
The EC focused on selective catalytic reduction systems, which reduce nitrogen oxides from diesel car emissions, and “Otto” particulate filters that reduce particulate matter emissions from cars that burn gasoline. The EC said their case was not related to other investigations into the use of illegal defeat devices to cheat emissions tests and possible violations of environmental laws.
The new anti-pollution allegations against the German car makers comes just four years after what the “diesel-gate scandal” on 2015 when the Volkswagen group admitted to fitting around 11 million vehicles worldwide with a device aimed at cheating pollution tests. The German automaker used a “defeat device” or software intended to pass regulatory lab tests, but in real-world driving, the emissions were several times the permissible limits. The scandal has thus far sent a senior executive on a seven-year prison term, cost former Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn his job and led to suspensions of several top Volkswagen executives.

Dar es Salaam. Tanzanian runners Marco Joseph and Sarah Ramadhan failed to shine in the Hanover Marathon in Germany over the weekend.
Ramadhan finished 11th in the women\xe2\x80\x99s race, but failed to secure qualifying marks for the World Athletics Championship and 2020 Olympic Games.
In the race won by Kenyan Racheal Jemutai in 2:26.15, Ramadhan, one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s top female runners, clocked 2:39:20.
The World Athletics Championship and Olympic Games will take place in Doha, Qatar and Tokyo, Japan respectively.
Qualifying marks for the World Athletics Championship and Tokyo Olympics are 2.37.00 and is 2.29.30 respectively.
In the men\xe2\x80\x99s race, which featured elite marathoners from around the world, Joseph was far from impressive.
Two local runners have so far qualified for the two championships (Olympic Games and World Athletics Championship).
The athletes are Alphonce Simbu and Augustino Sulle.
Simbu and Sulle booked places in the major competitions after clocking 2.08.27 and 2.12.42 respectively in the Lake Biwa Marathon in Osaka, Japan, a few weeks ago.
Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s Silas Mwetich and Racheal Jemutai claimed top honours in the Hanover Marathon.
Mwetich won the men\xe2\x80\x99s race in 2:09.37 while Jemutai clocked 2:26.15 to win the women\xe2\x80\x99s marathon.
Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s Hosea Kipkemboi finished second in the men\xe2\x80\x99s race in 2:10.40 while Ethiopian Debas Wale clocked 2:10.57 to finish third.
In women\xe2\x80\x99s race, the second position went to Ethiopia\xe2\x80\x99s Memuye Gebeyahu (2:27.35) and Polish Karolina Nadolska finished third in 2:27.43.

BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s environment minister says the government will discuss introducing a carbon tax as part of its national plan to curb climate change.
Speaking after the first meeting of a special "climate Cabinet," German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Wednesday that government ministers would, over the coming months, put forward proposals for cutting greenhouse gases in the areas they oversee.
Germany\'s transport ministry opposes sector-specific targets, but Schulze insisted "everyone will have to shoulder some of the responsibility."
She also displayed openness to some kind of carbon tax. Other countries have already introduced carbon pricing to discourage the burning of fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases and stoke global warming.
Schulze said of such carbon taxes that "there are many different models that will also be debated in Cabinet."

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel has received former U.S. President Barack Obama at her office in Berlin for a meeting characterized by German officials as a routine private encounter with a former international peer.
Obama could be seen waving as he left the chancellery alongside Merkel Friday. Merkel\'s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she has met repeatedly with ex-heads of state and government "with whom she worked together closely and well for a time."
He said the meeting has no implications for current German-U.S. relations. Asked whether it was a signal to President Donald Trump, with whom Germany has a sometimes-complicated relationship, Seibert replied: "I would firmly reject that impression."
Merkel and Obama have already met in Berlin since the former president left office, participating in a discussion at a May 2017 conference.


Germany extends African missions another year
BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s Cabinet has approved extending Germany\'s military missions in Africa for another year.
The dpa news agency reported Wednesday that that includes German troops taking part in a European Union training mission in Mali known as EUTM, and the United Nations "Minusma" peacekeeping force there.
Dpa reports the Cabinet also plans to extend Germany\'s commitment to the EU\'s anti-piracy mission Atalanta that operates off the Horn of Africa, but to reduce its maximum troop numbers from 600 to 400. There are currently 80 troops taking part.
Germany currently has some 180 troops involved in the EUTM mission, with a maximum of 350. A further 900 are in Mali and Niger as part of the Minusma force, with a maximum of 1,100.
Those troop commitments are to remain unchanged.


Germany: teen with knives detained after school threat
BERLIN (AP) — Police in northern Germany say they have detained a 17-year-old boy with several knives after being tipped off to an online chat in which someone threatened to kill several people at a school.
Officers checked students entering the school in Flensburg, just south of the Danish border, on Wednesday morning and detained the German teenager. Police said initial investigations firmed up suspicions against him, without elaborating. The chat surfaced on Tuesday evening and the threat applied to Wednesday.
Lessons were held as normal after boy was detained.


Germany indicts suspected rebel over Sri Lanka war crimes
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have indicted a Sri Lankan man suspected of involvement in killing 15 captured government soldiers while fighting for the Tamil Tigers rebel group.
Federal prosecutors said Friday that 37-year-old Sivatheeban B. is accused of membership in a foreign terrorist organization, war crimes, two cases of manslaughter and 11 cases of attempted manslaughter.
The man, whose surname wasn\'t released due to German privacy rules, was arrested in August.
Prosecutors allege that in 2008 the suspect guarded 15 captured soldiers as they were driven to a site where they were executed, and later helped burn their bodies. In a separate incident a year later, he fired on 13 soldiers, two of whom died.
The rebel group, which fought for a separate state for ethnic minority Tamils, was defeated in 2009.


Germany: 70-year-old babysitter guilty of killing boy
BERLIN (AP) — A court in Germany has found a 70-year-old babysitter guilty of manslaughter for the killing of a 7-year-old boy she was looking after.
Judges at the regional court in the southwestern city of Heilbronn sentenced the woman Monday to 10 years and six months in prison.
The trained nurse, who had been the boy\'s babysitter for several years and who he called "Grandma Elisabeth," had strangled the child while he was staying the night at her home.
Judges rejected the defense lawyer\'s arguments that his client, whose full name wasn\'t released because of German privacy rules, had killed the boy by accident, though they did take into consideration that she might have been suffering from depression and been overwhelmed by stress.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.
Affordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\'t think that is the right solution. He said "the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available."
Andres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a "false solution."


Sea-Eye asks Germany to help find port for 64 migrants
MILAN (AP) — The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says it is asking Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a safe port for the 64 migrants it rescued off Libya earlier this week.
Sea-Watch spokesman Carlotta Weibl said Friday that the rescue boat Alan Kurdi remains in international waters off Lampedusa and will not approach Italy\'s southernmost island until it has permission.
She said conditions on board were worsening and that a storm was approaching. She said a request has been made to the German foreign ministry to find a solution.
Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers to pack unseaworthy rubber dinghies with migrants looking for sanctuary in Europe.

BERLIN (AP) — German government statistics show crime dropped in the country last year, including violent offenses.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said as he presented an annual crime report on Tuesday that "every crime is one too many, but objectively, this is the lowest level in decades."
Police agencies recorded more than 5.6 million cases in 2018, 3.6 percent fewer than in 2017. They included 185,377 violent crimes, a 1.9 percent decrease from the year before.
Despite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.
The overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent. The clearance rate for solved murder and manslaughter cases was 96.1%.


Germany protests to Brunei envoy over anti-gay law plans
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s Foreign Ministry has protested Brunei\'s plans to implement Islamic criminal laws that punishes gay sex by stoning offenders to death.
In a statement Tuesday, the ministry said German diplomats expressed concern at the introduction of Sharia law penalties and appealed to Brunei\'s ambassador Monday to "abide by existing international human rights obligations."
The legal change in the tiny, oil-rich monarchy, which also includes amputation for theft, is due to come into force Wednesday.
Human rights group Amnesty International has slammed the punishments as "vicious ."
American actor George Clooney, who is married to prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, called recently for a boycott of luxury hotels in Europe and the United States linked to Brunei\'s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.


Germany says emissions dropped in 2018 amid warm weather
BERLIN (AP) — The German government says greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2% in 2018, the first major decrease in four years.
Estimates published Tuesday by the Environment Ministry show Germany released the equivalent of 868.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, 38 million less than 2017.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Germany benefited from 2018\'s warm and sunny weather, which increased production of renewable energy and reduced the need for heating fuel.
Germany\'s emissions last year were about 30.6 percent lower than in 1990. The country aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent from that baseline year by 2030 as part of efforts to curb climate change.
Cabinet is debating a bill that could set legally binding emissions goals for each sector of the economy.

Germany mulls new rules to boost organ donations
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s health minister is launching a drive to tackle a shortage of donor organs with a reform that would make most people potential organ donors unless they object.
At present, doctors in Germany can transplant organs only from people who actively register and carry a donor card. Under the new system proposed Monday by Health Minister Jens Spahn and cross-party supporters, people would automatically be considered as donors unless they opt out by putting themselves on a register saying they object — which they could do at any time.
Relatives could also tell officials that the deceased made clear they didn\'t want to donate.
Spahn said 20 other European Union countries have similar systems and "everything we have tried so far hasn\'t led to a rise in donor figures."

BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s environment minister says the government will discuss introducing a carbon tax as part of its national plan to curb climate change.
Speaking after the first meeting of a special "climate Cabinet," German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Wednesday that government ministers would, over the coming months, put forward proposals for cutting greenhouse gases in the areas they oversee.
Germany\'s transport ministry opposes sector-specific targets, but Schulze insisted "everyone will have to shoulder some of the responsibility."
She also displayed openness to some kind of carbon tax. Other countries have already introduced carbon pricing to discourage the burning of fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases and stoke global warming.
Schulze said of such carbon taxes that "there are many different models that will also be debated in Cabinet."


Germany mulls new rules to boost organ donations
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s health minister is launching a drive to tackle a shortage of donor organs with a reform that would make most people potential organ donors unless they object.
At present, doctors in Germany can transplant organs only from people who actively register and carry a donor card. Under the new system proposed Monday by Health Minister Jens Spahn and cross-party supporters, people would automatically be considered as donors unless they opt out by putting themselves on a register saying they object — which they could do at any time.
Relatives could also tell officials that the deceased made clear they didn\'t want to donate.
Spahn said 20 other European Union countries have similar systems and "everything we have tried so far hasn\'t led to a rise in donor figures."

BERLIN (AP) — German government statistics show crime dropped in the country last year, including violent offenses.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said as he presented an annual crime report on Tuesday that "every crime is one too many, but objectively, this is the lowest level in decades."
Police agencies recorded more than 5.6 million cases in 2018, 3.6 percent fewer than in 2017. They included 185,377 violent crimes, a 1.9 percent decrease from the year before.
Despite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.
The overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent. The clearance rate for solved murder and manslaughter cases was 96.1%.


Germany indicts Indian couple with spying on Sikh opposition
BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they have indicted two Indian citizens for spying on the Sikh opposition and Kashmiri separatists in Germany.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that 50-year-old Manmohan S. is accused of providing information to India\'s foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, from January 2015 onward.
His wife, 51-year-old Kanwal Jit K., allegedly also began cooperating with the spy agency starting in July 2017. Their full names weren\'t released due to German privacy rules.
Prosecutors said the couple is accused of receiving a total of 7,200 euros (about $8,100) for the information they provided to their handler, who was stationed in Germany.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel has received former U.S. President Barack Obama at her office in Berlin for a meeting characterized by German officials as a routine private encounter with a former international peer.
Obama could be seen waving as he left the chancellery alongside Merkel Friday. Merkel\'s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she has met repeatedly with ex-heads of state and government "with whom she worked together closely and well for a time."
He said the meeting has no implications for current German-U.S. relations. Asked whether it was a signal to President Donald Trump, with whom Germany has a sometimes-complicated relationship, Seibert replied: "I would firmly reject that impression."
Merkel and Obama have already met in Berlin since the former president left office, participating in a discussion at a May 2017 conference.


Germany raids groups suspected of supporting Hamas
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have carried out raids on groups suspected of helping the militant Palestinian group Hamas under the guise of providing humanitarian aid.
The interior ministry said some 90 properties across Germany associated with an "Islamist network" were searched on Wednesday. It said the network was headed by two groups based in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, WWR Help and Ansaar International.
The ministry said there are indications that the network provided financial and propaganda support to Hamas, a longtime enemy of Israel that runs the Gaza Strip and was listed as a terror group by the European Union in 2001.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that "anyone who supports Hamas under the cover of humanitarian aid flouts fundamental value judgments of our constitution."


Germany: 70-year-old babysitter guilty of killing boy
BERLIN (AP) — A court in Germany has found a 70-year-old babysitter guilty of manslaughter for the killing of a 7-year-old boy she was looking after.
Judges at the regional court in the southwestern city of Heilbronn sentenced the woman Monday to 10 years and six months in prison.
The trained nurse, who had been the boy\'s babysitter for several years and who he called "Grandma Elisabeth," had strangled the child while he was staying the night at her home.
Judges rejected the defense lawyer\'s arguments that his client, whose full name wasn\'t released because of German privacy rules, had killed the boy by accident, though they did take into consideration that she might have been suffering from depression and been overwhelmed by stress.


Germany indicts suspected rebel over Sri Lanka war crimes
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have indicted a Sri Lankan man suspected of involvement in killing 15 captured government soldiers while fighting for the Tamil Tigers rebel group.
Federal prosecutors said Friday that 37-year-old Sivatheeban B. is accused of membership in a foreign terrorist organization, war crimes, two cases of manslaughter and 11 cases of attempted manslaughter.
The man, whose surname wasn\'t released due to German privacy rules, was arrested in August.
Prosecutors allege that in 2008 the suspect guarded 15 captured soldiers as they were driven to a site where they were executed, and later helped burn their bodies. In a separate incident a year later, he fired on 13 soldiers, two of whom died.
The rebel group, which fought for a separate state for ethnic minority Tamils, was defeated in 2009.


Germany charges Afghan man with war crimes
BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they\'ve charged a 26-year-old former Afghan officer with war crimes for allegedly abusing prisoners and defiling the corpse of a man he boasted he\'d "killed like a donkey."
Ahmad Zaheer D., whose last name wasn\'t given in line with privacy laws, is accused of shaking two prisoners by the hair during an interrogation around late 2013 and punching one, while another soldier hit a third with a hose.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that the suspect brought the corpse of a high-ranking enemy commander into a town in March 2014, telling villagers he\'d killed him and putting a meat hook into the corpse\'s head, then stringing the body up with a rope.
He was arrested Oct. 25 near Munich. It wasn\'t clear when he came to Germany.


Germany extends African missions another year
BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s Cabinet has approved extending Germany\'s military missions in Africa for another year.
The dpa news agency reported Wednesday that that includes German troops taking part in a European Union training mission in Mali known as EUTM, and the United Nations "Minusma" peacekeeping force there.
Dpa reports the Cabinet also plans to extend Germany\'s commitment to the EU\'s anti-piracy mission Atalanta that operates off the Horn of Africa, but to reduce its maximum troop numbers from 600 to 400. There are currently 80 troops taking part.
Germany currently has some 180 troops involved in the EUTM mission, with a maximum of 350. A further 900 are in Mali and Niger as part of the Minusma force, with a maximum of 1,100.
Those troop commitments are to remain unchanged.


Sea-Eye asks Germany to help find port for 64 migrants
MILAN (AP) — The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says it is asking Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a safe port for the 64 migrants it rescued off Libya earlier this week.
Sea-Watch spokesman Carlotta Weibl said Friday that the rescue boat Alan Kurdi remains in international waters off Lampedusa and will not approach Italy\'s southernmost island until it has permission.
She said conditions on board were worsening and that a storm was approaching. She said a request has been made to the German foreign ministry to find a solution.
Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers to pack unseaworthy rubber dinghies with migrants looking for sanctuary in Europe.


Germany says emissions dropped in 2018 amid warm weather
BERLIN (AP) — The German government says greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2% in 2018, the first major decrease in four years.
Estimates published Tuesday by the Environment Ministry show Germany released the equivalent of 868.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, 38 million less than 2017.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Germany benefited from 2018\'s warm and sunny weather, which increased production of renewable energy and reduced the need for heating fuel.
Germany\'s emissions last year were about 30.6 percent lower than in 1990. The country aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent from that baseline year by 2030 as part of efforts to curb climate change.
Cabinet is debating a bill that could set legally binding emissions goals for each sector of the economy.


Germany: teen with knives detained after school threat
BERLIN (AP) — Police in northern Germany say they have detained a 17-year-old boy with several knives after being tipped off to an online chat in which someone threatened to kill several people at a school.
Officers checked students entering the school in Flensburg, just south of the Danish border, on Wednesday morning and detained the German teenager. Police said initial investigations firmed up suspicions against him, without elaborating. The chat surfaced on Tuesday evening and the threat applied to Wednesday.
Lessons were held as normal after boy was detained.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.
Affordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\'t think that is the right solution. He said "the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available."
Andres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a "false solution."

BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s Foreign Ministry has protested Brunei\'s plans to implement Islamic criminal laws that punishes gay sex by stoning offenders to death.
In a statement Tuesday, the ministry said German diplomats expressed concern at the introduction of Sharia law penalties and appealed to Brunei\'s ambassador Monday to "abide by existing international human rights obligations."
The legal change in the tiny, oil-rich monarchy, which also includes amputation for theft, is due to come into force Wednesday.
Human rights group Amnesty International has slammed the punishments as "vicious ."
American actor George Clooney, who is married to prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, called recently for a boycott of luxury hotels in Europe and the United States linked to Brunei\'s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.

BERLIN (AP) — German government statistics show crime dropped in the country last year, including violent offenses.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said as he presented an annual crime report on Tuesday that "every crime is one too many, but objectively, this is the lowest level in decades."
Police agencies recorded more than 5.6 million cases in 2018, 3.6 percent fewer than in 2017. They included 185,377 violent crimes, a 1.9 percent decrease from the year before.
Despite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.
The overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent. The clearance rate for solved murder and manslaughter cases was 96.1%.

MILAN (AP) — The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says it is asking Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a safe port for the 64 migrants it rescued off Libya earlier this week.
Sea-Watch spokesman Carlotta Weibl said Friday that the rescue boat Alan Kurdi remains in international waters off Lampedusa and will not approach Italy\'s southernmost island until it has permission.
She said conditions on board were worsening and that a storm was approaching. She said a request has been made to the German foreign ministry to find a solution.
Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers to pack unseaworthy rubber dinghies with migrants looking for sanctuary in Europe.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s Cabinet has approved extending Germany\'s military missions in Africa for another year.
The dpa news agency reported Wednesday that that includes German troops taking part in a European Union training mission in Mali known as EUTM, and the United Nations "Minusma" peacekeeping force there.
Dpa reports the Cabinet also plans to extend Germany\'s commitment to the EU\'s anti-piracy mission Atalanta that operates off the Horn of Africa, but to reduce its maximum troop numbers from 600 to 400. There are currently 80 troops taking part.
Germany currently has some 180 troops involved in the EUTM mission, with a maximum of 350. A further 900 are in Mali and Niger as part of the Minusma force, with a maximum of 1,100.
Those troop commitments are to remain unchanged.


TEHRAN, Apr. 08 (MNA) \xe2\x80\x93 In a ceremony attended by German Ambassador to Iran Michael Klor-Berchtold, German Red Cross delivered its humanitarian aid cargo to Iranian Red Crescent in Tehran on Monday. The equipment will be used in the relief operations to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s flood-stricken people.
\t\t\t\t


In a Saturday tweet, the German Foreign Office noted that \xe2\x80\x9cIran will be on the agenda today at G7 France as well.\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x9cWe remain convinced that we need a framework that assures that Iran will not engage in the production of uranium. We will also talk about Iran\'s missile program and role in Syria,\xe2\x80\x9d the office quoted German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas as saying.
Despite US unilateral withdrawal from JCPOA (joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) in May 2018, Iran has abided by all its nuclear commitments. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly reaffirmed Iran\'s compliance with the deal; the latest affirmation came on Wednesday by IAEA head Yukiya Amano.
As far as missile program is concerned, Iran has repeatedly maintained that its missile program is in line with its deterrence doctrine and that it will continue testing conventional missiles.
The G7 is made up of the US, Japan, Germany, France, the UK, Italy and Canada. G7 interior ministers have gathered in Paris to discuss a host of different issues from cyber security to international topics such as the situation in Venezuela.
Washington has sent lower-ranking officials instead of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen; a move which has raised questions about the G7\'s effectiveness at solving the issues that are being tackled.
The Paris and Dinard meetings aim at preparing a G7 summit that France will host in August in the southwestern city of Biarritz.
MAH/PR


In a Monday tweet, Klor-Berchtold wrote that German Foreign Ministry would provide humanitarian assistance to flood victims in Iran, adding that \xe2\x80\x9c40 boats and safety equipment will be delivered by German Red Cross to the Iranian Red Crescent.\xe2\x80\x9d
The official had earlier expressed sympathy with the flood-stricken people in Iran, expressing his country\xe2\x80\x99s readiness to provide humanitarian help.
Heavy rains triggered raging torrents of water in several areas of Golestan province, near the Caspian Sea on March 19. The wave of heavy rains has so far continued as many of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s provinces, including Lorestan and Khuzestan in the west, are now facing an emergency situation.
More than two dozen people have been killed. Meanwhile, rescue efforts are underway in several provinces.

Germany says emissions dropped in 2018 amid warm weather
BERLIN (AP) — The German government says greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2% in 2018, the first major decrease in four years.
Estimates published Tuesday by the Environment Ministry show Germany released the equivalent of 868.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, 38 million less than 2017.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Germany benefited from 2018\'s warm and sunny weather, which increased production of renewable energy and reduced the need for heating fuel.
Germany\'s emissions last year were about 30.6 percent lower than in 1990. The country aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent from that baseline year by 2030 as part of efforts to curb climate change.
Cabinet is debating a bill that could set legally binding emissions goals for each sector of the economy.


Germany protests to Brunei envoy over anti-gay law plans
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s Foreign Ministry has protested Brunei\'s plans to implement Islamic criminal laws that punishes gay sex by stoning offenders to death.
In a statement Tuesday, the ministry said German diplomats expressed concern at the introduction of Sharia law penalties and appealed to Brunei\'s ambassador Monday to "abide by existing international human rights obligations."
The legal change in the tiny, oil-rich monarchy, which also includes amputation for theft, is due to come into force Wednesday.
Human rights group Amnesty International has slammed the punishments as "vicious ."
American actor George Clooney, who is married to prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, called recently for a boycott of luxury hotels in Europe and the United States linked to Brunei\'s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel has received former U.S. President Barack Obama at her office in Berlin for a meeting characterized by German officials as a routine private encounter with a former international peer.
Obama could be seen waving as he left the chancellery alongside Merkel Friday. Merkel\'s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she has met repeatedly with ex-heads of state and government "with whom she worked together closely and well for a time."
He said the meeting has no implications for current German-U.S. relations. Asked whether it was a signal to President Donald Trump, with whom Germany has a sometimes-complicated relationship, Seibert replied: "I would firmly reject that impression."
Merkel and Obama have already met in Berlin since the former president left office, participating in a discussion at a May 2017 conference.

Germany: teen with knives detained after school threat
BERLIN (AP) — Police in northern Germany say they have detained a 17-year-old boy with several knives after being tipped off to an online chat in which someone threatened to kill several people at a school.
Officers checked students entering the school in Flensburg, just south of the Danish border, on Wednesday morning and detained the German teenager. Police said initial investigations firmed up suspicions against him, without elaborating. The chat surfaced on Tuesday evening and the threat applied to Wednesday.
Lessons were held as normal after boy was detained.


Germany indicts suspected rebel over Sri Lanka war crimes
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have indicted a Sri Lankan man suspected of involvement in killing 15 captured government soldiers while fighting for the Tamil Tigers rebel group.
Federal prosecutors said Friday that 37-year-old Sivatheeban B. is accused of membership in a foreign terrorist organization, war crimes, two cases of manslaughter and 11 cases of attempted manslaughter.
The man, whose surname wasn\'t released due to German privacy rules, was arrested in August.
Prosecutors allege that in 2008 the suspect guarded 15 captured soldiers as they were driven to a site where they were executed, and later helped burn their bodies. In a separate incident a year later, he fired on 13 soldiers, two of whom died.
The rebel group, which fought for a separate state for ethnic minority Tamils, was defeated in 2009.


Germany: 70-year-old babysitter guilty of killing boy
BERLIN (AP) — A court in Germany has found a 70-year-old babysitter guilty of manslaughter for the killing of a 7-year-old boy she was looking after.
Judges at the regional court in the southwestern city of Heilbronn sentenced the woman Monday to 10 years and six months in prison.
The trained nurse, who had been the boy\'s babysitter for several years and who he called "Grandma Elisabeth," had strangled the child while he was staying the night at her home.
Judges rejected the defense lawyer\'s arguments that his client, whose full name wasn\'t released because of German privacy rules, had killed the boy by accident, though they did take into consideration that she might have been suffering from depression and been overwhelmed by stress.

BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s environment minister says the government will discuss introducing a carbon tax as part of its national plan to curb climate change.
Speaking after the first meeting of a special "climate Cabinet," German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Wednesday that government ministers would, over the coming months, put forward proposals for cutting greenhouse gases in the areas they oversee.
Germany\'s transport ministry opposes sector-specific targets, but Schulze insisted "everyone will have to shoulder some of the responsibility."
She also displayed openness to some kind of carbon tax. Other countries have already introduced carbon pricing to discourage the burning of fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases and stoke global warming.
Schulze said of such carbon taxes that "there are many different models that will also be debated in Cabinet."

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.
Affordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\'t think that is the right solution. He said "the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available."
Andres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a "false solution."


Germany charges Afghan man with war crimes
BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they\'ve charged a 26-year-old former Afghan officer with war crimes for allegedly abusing prisoners and defiling the corpse of a man he boasted he\'d "killed like a donkey."
Ahmad Zaheer D., whose last name wasn\'t given in line with privacy laws, is accused of shaking two prisoners by the hair during an interrogation around late 2013 and punching one, while another soldier hit a third with a hose.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that the suspect brought the corpse of a high-ranking enemy commander into a town in March 2014, telling villagers he\'d killed him and putting a meat hook into the corpse\'s head, then stringing the body up with a rope.
He was arrested Oct. 25 near Munich. It wasn\'t clear when he came to Germany.

Germany mulls new rules to boost organ donations
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s health minister is launching a drive to tackle a shortage of donor organs with a reform that would make most people potential organ donors unless they object.
At present, doctors in Germany can transplant organs only from people who actively register and carry a donor card. Under the new system proposed Monday by Health Minister Jens Spahn and cross-party supporters, people would automatically be considered as donors unless they opt out by putting themselves on a register saying they object — which they could do at any time.
Relatives could also tell officials that the deceased made clear they didn\'t want to donate.
Spahn said 20 other European Union countries have similar systems and "everything we have tried so far hasn\'t led to a rise in donor figures."


Germany indicts Indian couple with spying on Sikh opposition
BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they have indicted two Indian citizens for spying on the Sikh opposition and Kashmiri separatists in Germany.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that 50-year-old Manmohan S. is accused of providing information to India\'s foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, from January 2015 onward.
His wife, 51-year-old Kanwal Jit K., allegedly also began cooperating with the spy agency starting in July 2017. Their full names weren\'t released due to German privacy rules.
Prosecutors said the couple is accused of receiving a total of 7,200 euros (about $8,100) for the information they provided to their handler, who was stationed in Germany.


Germany raids groups suspected of supporting Hamas
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have carried out raids on groups suspected of helping the militant Palestinian group Hamas under the guise of providing humanitarian aid.
The interior ministry said some 90 properties across Germany associated with an "Islamist network" were searched on Wednesday. It said the network was headed by two groups based in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, WWR Help and Ansaar International.
The ministry said there are indications that the network provided financial and propaganda support to Hamas, a longtime enemy of Israel that runs the Gaza Strip and was listed as a terror group by the European Union in 2001.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that "anyone who supports Hamas under the cover of humanitarian aid flouts fundamental value judgments of our constitution."

BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s environment minister says the government will discuss introducing a carbon tax as part of its national plan to curb climate change.
Speaking after the first meeting of a special "climate Cabinet," German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Wednesday that government ministers would, over the coming months, put forward proposals for cutting greenhouse gases in the areas they oversee.
Germany\'s transport ministry opposes sector-specific targets, but Schulze insisted "everyone will have to shoulder some of the responsibility."
She also displayed openness to some kind of carbon tax. Other countries have already introduced carbon pricing to discourage the burning of fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases and stoke global warming.
Schulze said of such carbon taxes that "there are many different models that will also be debated in Cabinet."


Germany: 70-year-old babysitter guilty of killing boy

BERLIN (AP) — A court in Germany has found a 70-year-old babysitter guilty of manslaughter for the killing of a 7-year-old boy she was looking after.
Judges at the regional court in the southwestern city of Heilbronn sentenced the woman Monday to 10 years and six months in prison.
The trained nurse, who had been the boy\'s babysitter for several years and who he called "Grandma Elisabeth," had strangled the child while he was staying the night at her home.
Judges rejected the defense lawyer\'s arguments that his client, whose full name wasn\'t released because of German privacy rules, had killed the boy by accident, though they did take into consideration that she might have been suffering from depression and been overwhelmed by stress.


Germany indicts suspected rebel over Sri Lanka war crimes
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have indicted a Sri Lankan man suspected of involvement in killing 15 captured government soldiers while fighting for the Tamil Tigers rebel group.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
Federal prosecutors said Friday that 37-year-old Sivatheeban B. is accused of membership in a foreign terrorist organization, war crimes, two cases of manslaughter and 11 cases of attempted manslaughter.
The man, whose surname wasn\'t released due to German privacy rules, was arrested in August.
Prosecutors allege that in 2008 the suspect guarded 15 captured soldiers as they were driven to a site where they were executed, and later helped burn their bodies. In a separate incident a year later, he fired on 13 soldiers, two of whom died.
The rebel group, which fought for a separate state for ethnic minority Tamils, was defeated in 2009.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel has received former U.S. President Barack Obama at her office in Berlin for a meeting characterized by German officials as a routine private encounter with a former international peer.
Obama could be seen waving as he left the chancellery alongside Merkel Friday. Merkel\'s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she has met repeatedly with ex-heads of state and government "with whom she worked together closely and well for a time."
He said the meeting has no implications for current German-U.S. relations. Asked whether it was a signal to President Donald Trump, with whom Germany has a sometimes-complicated relationship, Seibert replied: "I would firmly reject that impression."
Merkel and Obama have already met in Berlin since the former president left office, participating in a discussion at a May 2017 conference.

BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they\'ve charged a 26-year-old former Afghan officer with war crimes for allegedly abusing prisoners and defiling the corpse of a man he boasted he\'d "killed like a donkey."
Ahmad Zaheer D., whose last name wasn\'t given in line with privacy laws, is accused of shaking two prisoners by the hair during an interrogation around late 2013 and punching one, while another soldier hit a third with a hose.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that the suspect brought the corpse of a high-ranking enemy commander into a town in March 2014, telling villagers he\'d killed him and putting a meat hook into the corpse\'s head, then stringing the body up with a rope.
He was arrested Oct. 25 near Munich. It wasn\'t clear when he came to Germany.


Germany extends African missions another year
BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s Cabinet has approved extending Germany\'s military missions in Africa for another year.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
The dpa news agency reported Wednesday that that includes German troops taking part in a European Union training mission in Mali known as EUTM, and the United Nations "Minusma" peacekeeping force there.
Dpa reports the Cabinet also plans to extend Germany\'s commitment to the EU\'s anti-piracy mission Atalanta that operates off the Horn of Africa, but to reduce its maximum troop numbers from 600 to 400. There are currently 80 troops taking part.
Germany currently has some 180 troops involved in the EUTM mission, with a maximum of 350. A further 900 are in Mali and Niger as part of the Minusma force, with a maximum of 1,100.
Those troop commitments are to remain unchanged.

BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have carried out raids on groups suspected of helping the militant Palestinian group Hamas under the guise of providing humanitarian aid.
The interior ministry said some 90 properties across Germany associated with an "Islamist network" were searched on Wednesday. It said the network was headed by two groups based in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, WWR Help and Ansaar International.
The ministry said there are indications that the network provided financial and propaganda support to Hamas, a longtime enemy of Israel that runs the Gaza Strip and was listed as a terror group by the European Union in 2001.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that "anyone who supports Hamas under the cover of humanitarian aid flouts fundamental value judgments of our constitution."

Sea-Eye asks Germany to help find port for 64 migrants
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
MILAN (AP) — The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says it is asking Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a safe port for the 64 migrants it rescued off Libya earlier this week.
Sea-Watch spokesman Carlotta Weibl said Friday that the rescue boat Alan Kurdi remains in international waters off Lampedusa and will not approach Italy\'s southernmost island until it has permission.
She said conditions on board were worsening and that a storm was approaching. She said a request has been made to the German foreign ministry to find a solution.
Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers to pack unseaworthy rubber dinghies with migrants looking for sanctuary in Europe.


Germany mulls new rules to boost organ donations
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s health minister on Monday launched a drive to tackle a shortage of donor organs with a reform that would make most people potential organ donors unless they object.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
At present, doctors in Germany can transplant organs only from people who actively declare their willingness, for example by carrying a donor card or making a living will. Around 2,000 people in the country of 80 million die each year while waiting for transplants.
Under the new system proposed Monday by Health Minister Jens Spahn and a cross-party group of supporters, people would automatically be considered as donors unless they opt out by putting themselves on a register saying they object — which they could do at any time.
Relatives could also tell officials that the deceased made clear they didn\'t want to donate. Everyone aged 16 and over would be informed repeatedly of the new system, while there would be no donations by people who aren\'t in a position to grasp the significance of the decision, for example because of mental disability.
Spahn said 20 out of 28 European Union countries have similar systems and "everything we have tried so far hasn\'t led to a rise in donor figures."
"We still have about 10 times more people on the waiting list for an organ than the number that are transplanted," said Karl Lauterbach, a health policy expert with the center-left Social Democrats. Last year, there were some 9,400 people on the waiting list and well under 1,000 transplants, while about 2,000 people on the waiting list die each year, he said.
Germany\'s parliament is expected eventually to hold a free vote on new rules.
Another cross-party group of lawmakers is calling for people to be regularly asked about their intentions and an online register of donors. The group says it wants to ensure that organ donation remains "a conscious and voluntary decision that cannot be forced by the state."


Germany protests to Brunei envoy over anti-gay law plans
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s Foreign Ministry has protested Brunei\'s plans to implement Islamic criminal laws that punishes gay sex by stoning offenders to death.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
In a statement Tuesday, the ministry said German diplomats expressed concern at the introduction of Sharia law penalties and appealed to Brunei\'s ambassador Monday to "abide by existing international human rights obligations."
The legal change in the tiny, oil-rich monarchy, which also includes amputation for theft, is due to come into force Wednesday.
Human rights group Amnesty International has slammed the punishments as "vicious ."
American actor George Clooney, who is married to prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, called recently for a boycott of luxury hotels in Europe and the United States linked to Brunei\'s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.
Affordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\'t think that is the right solution. He said "the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available."
Andres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a "false solution."

BERLIN (AP) — German government statistics show crime dropped in the country last year, including violent offenses.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said as he presented an annual crime report on Tuesday that "every crime is one too many, but objectively, this is the lowest level in decades."
Police agencies recorded more than 5.6 million cases in 2018, 3.6 percent fewer than in 2017. They included 185,377 violent crimes, a 1.9 percent decrease from the year before.
Despite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.
The overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent. The clearance rate for solved murder and manslaughter cases was 96.1%.

Germany says emissions dropped in 2018 amid warm weather
BERLIN (AP) — The German government says greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2% in 2018, the first major decrease in four years.
Estimates published Tuesday by the Environment Ministry show Germany released the equivalent of 868.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, 38 million less than 2017.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Germany benefited from 2018\'s warm and sunny weather, which increased production of renewable energy and reduced the need for heating fuel.
Germany\'s emissions last year were about 30.6 percent lower than in 1990. The country aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent from that baseline year by 2030 as part of efforts to curb climate change.
Cabinet is debating a bill that could set legally binding emissions goals for each sector of the economy.

Germany indicts suspected rebel over Sri Lanka war crimes
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have indicted a Sri Lankan man suspected of involvement in killing 15 captured government soldiers while fighting for the Tamil Tigers rebel group.
Federal prosecutors said Friday that 37-year-old Sivatheeban B. is accused of membership in a foreign terrorist organization, war crimes, two cases of manslaughter and 11 cases of attempted manslaughter.
The man, whose surname wasn\'t released due to German privacy rules, was arrested in August.
Prosecutors allege that in 2008 the suspect guarded 15 captured soldiers as they were driven to a site where they were executed, and later helped burn their bodies. In a separate incident a year later, he fired on 13 soldiers, two of whom died.
The rebel group, which fought for a separate state for ethnic minority Tamils, was defeated in 2009.


Germany raids groups suspected of supporting Hamas

\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have carried out raids on groups suspected of helping the militant Palestinian group Hamas under the guise of providing humanitarian aid.
The interior ministry said some 90 properties across Germany associated with an "Islamist network" were searched on Wednesday. It said the network was headed by two groups based in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, WWR Help and Ansaar International.
The ministry said there are indications that the network provided financial and propaganda support to Hamas, a longtime enemy of Israel that runs the Gaza Strip and was listed as a terror group by the European Union in 2001.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that "anyone who supports Hamas under the cover of humanitarian aid flouts fundamental value judgments of our constitution."


Germany: 70-year-old babysitter guilty of killing boy

\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — A court in Germany has found a 70-year-old babysitter guilty of manslaughter for the killing of a 7-year-old boy she was looking after.
Judges at the regional court in the southwestern city of Heilbronn sentenced the woman Monday to 10 years and six months in prison.
The trained nurse, who had been the boy\'s babysitter for several years and who he called "Grandma Elisabeth," had strangled the child while he was staying the night at her home.
Judges rejected the defense lawyer\'s arguments that his client, whose full name wasn\'t released because of German privacy rules, had killed the boy by accident, though they did take into consideration that she might have been suffering from depression and been overwhelmed by stress.

BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s Foreign Ministry has protested Brunei\'s plans to implement Islamic criminal laws that punishes gay sex by stoning offenders to death.
In a statement Tuesday, the ministry said German diplomats expressed concern at the introduction of Sharia law penalties and appealed to Brunei\'s ambassador Monday to "abide by existing international human rights obligations."
The legal change in the tiny, oil-rich monarchy, which also includes amputation for theft, is due to come into force Wednesday.
Human rights group Amnesty International has slammed the punishments as "vicious ."
American actor George Clooney, who is married to prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, called recently for a boycott of luxury hotels in Europe and the United States linked to Brunei\'s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.
Affordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\'t think that is the right solution. He said "the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available."
Andres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a "false solution."

BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s environment minister says the government will discuss introducing a carbon tax as part of its national plan to curb climate change.
Speaking after the first meeting of a special "climate Cabinet," German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Wednesday that government ministers would, over the coming months, put forward proposals for cutting greenhouse gases in the areas they oversee.
Germany\'s transport ministry opposes sector-specific targets, but Schulze insisted "everyone will have to shoulder some of the responsibility."
She also displayed openness to some kind of carbon tax. Other countries have already introduced carbon pricing to discourage the burning of fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases and stoke global warming.
Schulze said of such carbon taxes that "there are many different models that will also be debated in Cabinet."


Germany charges Afghan man with war crimes
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they\'ve charged a 26-year-old former Afghan officer with war crimes for allegedly abusing prisoners and defiling the corpse of a man he boasted he\'d "killed like a donkey."
Ahmad Zaheer D., whose last name wasn\'t given in line with privacy laws, is accused of shaking two prisoners by the hair during an interrogation around late 2013 and punching one, while another soldier hit a third with a hose.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that the suspect brought the corpse of a high-ranking enemy commander into a town in March 2014, telling villagers he\'d killed him and putting a meat hook into the corpse\'s head, then stringing the body up with a rope.
He was arrested Oct. 25 near Munich. It wasn\'t clear when he came to Germany.


Germany extends African missions another year
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s Cabinet has approved extending Germany\'s military missions in Africa for another year.
The dpa news agency reported Wednesday that that includes German troops taking part in a European Union training mission in Mali known as EUTM, and the United Nations "Minusma" peacekeeping force there.
Dpa reports the Cabinet also plans to extend Germany\'s commitment to the EU\'s anti-piracy mission Atalanta that operates off the Horn of Africa, but to reduce its maximum troop numbers from 600 to 400. There are currently 80 troops taking part.
Germany currently has some 180 troops involved in the EUTM mission, with a maximum of 350. A further 900 are in Mali and Niger as part of the Minusma force, with a maximum of 1,100.
Those troop commitments are to remain unchanged.


Sea-Eye asks Germany to help find port for 64 migrants

\t \r
\r
\t\r
MILAN (AP) — The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says it is asking Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a safe port for the 64 migrants it rescued off Libya earlier this week.
Sea-Watch spokesman Carlotta Weibl said Friday that the rescue boat Alan Kurdi remains in international waters off Lampedusa and will not approach Italy\'s southernmost island until it has permission.
She said conditions on board were worsening and that a storm was approaching. She said a request has been made to the German foreign ministry to find a solution.
Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers to pack unseaworthy rubber dinghies with migrants looking for sanctuary in Europe.


Germany mulls new rules to boost organ donations
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s health minister is launching a drive to tackle a shortage of donor organs with a reform that would make most people potential organ donors unless they object.
At present, doctors in Germany can transplant organs only from people who actively register and carry a donor card. Under the new system proposed Monday by Health Minister Jens Spahn and cross-party supporters, people would automatically be considered as donors unless they opt out by putting themselves on a register saying they object — which they could do at any time.
Relatives could also tell officials that the deceased made clear they didn\'t want to donate.
Spahn said 20 other European Union countries have similar systems and "everything we have tried so far hasn\'t led to a rise in donor figures."

BERLIN (AP) — German government statistics show crime dropped in the country last year, including violent offenses.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said as he presented an annual crime report on Tuesday that "every crime is one too many, but objectively, this is the lowest level in decades."
Police agencies recorded more than 5.6 million cases in 2018, 3.6 percent fewer than in 2017. They included 185,377 violent crimes, a 1.9 percent decrease from the year before.
Despite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.
The overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent. The clearance rate for solved murder and manslaughter cases was 96.1%.

BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have indicted a Sri Lankan man suspected of involvement in killing 15 captured government soldiers while fighting for the Tamil Tigers rebel group.

Germany says emissions dropped in 2018 amid warm weather
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — The German government says greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2% in 2018, the first major decrease in four years.
Estimates published Tuesday by the Environment Ministry show Germany released the equivalent of 868.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, 38 million less than 2017.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Germany benefited from 2018\'s warm and sunny weather, which increased production of renewable energy and reduced the need for heating fuel.
Germany\'s emissions last year were about 30.6 percent lower than in 1990. The country aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent from that baseline year by 2030 as part of efforts to curb climate change.
Cabinet is debating a bill that could set legally binding emissions goals for each sector of the economy.

BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they have indicted two Indian citizens for spying on the Sikh opposition and Kashmiri separatists in Germany.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that 50-year-old Manmohan S. is accused of providing information to India\'s foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, from January 2015 onward.
His wife, 51-year-old Kanwal Jit K., allegedly also began cooperating with the spy agency starting in July 2017. Their full names weren\'t released due to German privacy rules.
Prosecutors said the couple is accused of receiving a total of 7,200 euros (about $8,100) for the information they provided to their handler, who was stationed in Germany.

Officers checked students entering the school in Flensburg, just south of the Danish border, on Wednesday morning and detained the German teenager.

Lessons were held as normal after boy was detained.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel has received former U.S. President Barack Obama at her office in Berlin for a meeting characterized by German officials as a routine private encounter with a former international peer.
Obama could be seen waving as he left the chancellery alongside Merkel Friday. Merkel\'s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she has met repeatedly with ex-heads of state and government "with whom she worked together closely and well for a time."
He said the meeting has no implications for current German-U.S. relations. Asked whether it was a signal to President Donald Trump, with whom Germany has a sometimes-complicated relationship, Seibert replied: "I would firmly reject that impression."
Merkel and Obama have already met in Berlin since the former president left office, participating in a discussion at a May 2017 conference.


Action had slowed to a trickle this week with new bids in each auction round dwindling to just a few million euros, fuelling speculation the auction could end up being Germany\'s cheapest ever.
The auction is being held in an old army barracks, with teams sequestered in separate rooms submitting offers via a secure network. The process, which can run for weeks, ends only when there are no new bids.
Bidding picked up again on Wednesday afternoon with Deutsche Telekom ending the day in a dominant position. As of Thursday morning, the total amount pledged was 2.9 billion euros (£2.5 billion).
Graphic: Germany\'s 5G Auction - Incremental Bids
Germany is auctioning 41 blocks of spectrum in the 2 gigahertz and 3.6 GHz bands. Analyst Usman Ghazi at Berenberg Bank had forecast that, in a benign scenario for operators, proceeds could total around 3 billion euros.
His base-case scenario sees 4-5 billion euros in proceeds, while a worst-case outcome would be upward of 8 billion euros - roughly in line with a costly 5G auction in Italy last year that has put operators\' finances under pressure.
New entrant 1&1 Drillisch had been bidding up the cost of spectrum in the 2 GHz band - which is more suited to running 4G services - to levels that Ghazi called irrational.
Drillisch, run by billionaire Ralph Dommermuth, had been on the ropes earlier in the process, with dibs on just one spectrum block, but came back in Round 97 with a massive bid to signal the seriousness of its intent.
Graphic: Germany\'s 5G Auction - Total Raised
Analysts note that Telefonica Deutschland, the market No.3 by revenues, has been passive in the 2 GHz band and speculate that it may have a reserve of existing adjacent spectrum to draw on for its network.
Bids are lower for spectrum in the 3.6 GHz band, which has higher data-carrying capacity and is suited to 5G applications such as running networked "smart" factories.
As of Round 126 https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/_tools/FrequenzXml/Auktion2019_XML/126.html, Deutsche Telekom was leading in 12 blocks, Vodafone in 11, Drillisch in 10, and Telefonica Deutschland in just two. Bids had been withdrawn on the other six blocks.
Germany\'s 4G spectrum auction in 2015 ended after raising 5.1 billion euros. A previous auction in 2010 went on for six weeks and ended after 224 rounds of bidding.

Versum Materials Inc. on Monday said Merck KGaA has offered to acquire the company for $53 a share, or about $5.78 billion, and that its board determined the bid constitutes a superior proposal to its planned all-stock merger with Entegris Inc.
The Tempe, Ariz., provider of chip-making materials said Entegris has the right to submit a counterproposal until April 11, but Entegris said it has considered its options and doesn\'t plan to propose a revised deal.
Versum in January agreed to combine with Entegris in a deal that would have united two chemical companies that make critical components for the semiconductor industry, but Merck in February stepped in with a proposal to buy Versum for $48 a share, or about $5.2 billion.
Versum\'s board rejected the unsolicited proposal but in late March said it would hold talks for a potentially better deal with the German pharmaceutical and specialty chemicals company.
Merck\'s new bid represents a 10.4% increase from its initial proposal and a 28% premium to Versum\'s closing price of $41.40 on Feb. 26, the day before Merck announced its initial approach.
Under the current merger agreement, Versum would be required to pay a $140 million breakup fee to Entegris if it backs out of the deal.
Shares of Versum, which have consistently traded above $48 since Merck made its initial bid, closed Monday at $51.78, up 1.1% on the day.. Shares of Entegris rose about 2.1% to end the day at $38.66.

The Dubai Health Authority has released the Dubai Health Investment
Guide 2019 which aims to provide foreign investors with information on
investment priorities and gaps as well as mapping of the investor
journey for health investments, key developments in the health sector
and to highlight the drivers that underpin investment and growth in the
health sector in Dubai.
“Dubai has achieved a number of qualitative accomplishments in the
development of its health care system due to the availability of
infrastructure reSources, the human reSources potential, and the
ambitious plans to improve the health care sector in the Emirate. Our
aim is to attract investments that benefit the emirate and the community
via an investment strategy in the health sector in line with the
emirate’s aspirations to provide a healthy global model that also meets
with the objectives of the Dubai Plan 2021.” Sheikh Maktoum bin
Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Deputy Ruler of Dubai
Germany has been a strategic partner and an important investor in the
UAE for many years. In 2017, Germany ranked 7th among all
foreign investors with more than USD 490 million capital invested in the
country and was the 4th largest exporter to the UAE. On the
other hand, the UAE is home to more than 900 German companies and has
many ongoing real estate and alternative energy projects, such as the
Mohammed bin Rashid city or the stake taken on the Gasha ultra-sour gas
project.
“We have developed the Dubai Health Investment Guide 2018-25, with an
aim to provide investors and private sector providers with comprehensive
information that will provide them with insights on investment
opportunities and clarity on the investment process and upcoming
reforms, supporting their investment decisions and thus helping us
address health system gaps and priorities over the coming years.” Dr.
Ibtesam Al Bastaki, Director, Investments & PPP’s, DHA.
The Investment and PPP’s department of the Dubai Health Authority
invites therefore investors from Germany to download the guide,
available on DHA’s website, and to discover investment opportunities in
the Emirate of Dubai.
“UAE represents an excellent investment platform for healthcare
providers wishing to address the local market as well as the broader
Middle-East. UAE’s healthcare market has been increasing rapidly over
the last decade, driven by the Emirate’s strong demographic dynamics, a
high prevalence of chronic diseases, and high percentage healthcare
coverage for its citizens and residents. UAE authorities play an active
role in supporting private healthcare providers wishing to establish a
presence.” Sven Heininger, Director International, Schön Klinik
“The King’s College Hospital expansion journey to the UAE, and
specifically to Dubai, has been a success so far. Our focus on
evidence-based healthcare, world class expertise and extraordinary
patient experience has been instrumental in aligning with the national
agenda of achieving a world-class healthcare system as part of Vision
2021. The response to our value proposition has been overwhelmingly
positive from key stakeholders, employers, payers and patients who
understand the need for private world class clinical care that is
efficient yet patient-centred, in a sophisticated market like Dubai.” Christian
Schuhmacher, CEO, King’s College Hospital London, UAE
Dubai leads the way for private sector participation in healthcare in
the MENA region. The Private Sector healthcare providers in Dubai have
contributed to developing a strong health ecosystem, they account for
over 79% of the utilization for outpatient services, and over 74% of
inpatient services. This is in line with the vision of His Highness
Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister
of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. It is also within the directives of His
Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince
of Dubai and Chairman of the Executive Council.
Increase in demand for quality health services due to Dubai’s rapid
urban development, population growth and influx of medical tourists is

UPM said it expected to cut 160 jobs at the Plattling mill near the Czech border and reduce the annual capacity of coated mechanical paper by 155,000 tonnes.
UPM is one of the world\'s largest makers of magazine paper, a sector which has been among the worst hit by a shift to digital publishing.
"Paper markets globally have been declining consistently over the past 10 years," Winfried Schaur, Executive Vice President at UPM Communication Papers, which includes magazine papers, said in a statement.
On Jan. 31, UPM forecast good demand in 2019 for most of its papers - excluding its Communications Papers unit, where it saw demand continuing to decline.
UPM will book 30 million euros (25.76 million pounds) in restructuring charges in the second quarter related to the closure, which will generate annual savings of 17 million euros.

Why This Is Important
The European CBD market is fairly small, but is poised for a tremendous growth in the near future driven by demand among consumers, high spending in the region, and an ease in regulations that might be catalyzed by the UN\'s decision regarding CBD that has recently been requested by the World Health Organization.
In a recent report, Brightfield Group said European CBD market could reach $1.7 billion by 2023, registering a CAGR of 42 percent. Germany is expected to be the leading market with a share of $605 million.
Aphria\'s stock traded higher by 6.2 percent to $9.90 per share at time of publication.

The talks in Washington will be dominated by political risks such as trade disputes and Britain\'s departure from the European Union, said the government official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Scholz, who is likely to face calls to increase fiscal stimulus to counter the effect of a slowing economy, will tell allies that Germany\'s large current account surplus will shrink gradually due to vibrant domestic demand and higher state spending, the official added.
Finance ministers and central bank governors of the world\'s 20 biggest economies are due to meet in Washington next week with the state of the global economy and political risks to growth at the top of the agenda.

German exporters are suffering from a slowing world economy, trade disputes and Brexit angst. Leading economic institutes last week slashed their forecast for 2019 growth and warned a long-term upswing had come to an end.
The Federal Statistics Office said seasonally adjusted exports were down by 1.3 percent on the month, the biggest drop in 12 months, while imports fell 1.6 percent.
The trade surplus edged up to 18.7 billion euros (£16 billion) from a revised 18.6 billion euros the previous month.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 0.5 percent decrease in exports and a 0.7 percent decline in imports. The trade surplus was expected to narrow to 18.0 billion euros.
"There simply seem to be too many crises in global trade for the German export sector to defy all of them at the same time," Carsten Brzeski from ING said.
He pointed to the trade dispute between the United States and China, growing fears of a no-deal Brexit, a possible cooling of the Chinese economy and problems in other emerging markets.
Data released last weak showed German industrial orders fell by the biggest margin in more than two years in February. However, industrial output rose slightly more than expected in the same month as mild weather helped a surge in construction.
Germany is in its 10th year of economic expansion, but narrowly skirted a recession at the end of last year and posted its weakest growth rate in five years in 2018.
The German government will update its growth forecast later this month. In January, Berlin said it expected the economy to grow by 1.0 percent this year.

The global lender said there was a case that these countries, which also included South Korea and Japan, should enact "limited, high-quality fiscal stimulus."
In its Fiscal Monitor report published as officials gather in Washington for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank, the IMF said any fiscal stimulus in China and Japan should be accompanied by a "credible medium-term consolidation plan."

(UPM, Helsinki, 2 April 2019 at 11:35 EET) - UPM plans to permanently close paper machine 10 at UPM Plattling, Germany, reducing the annual capacity of coated mechanical paper in Europe by approximately 155,000 tons. Paper production on paper machines 1 and 11 is planned to continue at the mill site.
In total 160 positions would be affected by the plans at UPM Plattling. The employee consultation process will start in the course of April in line with local legislation. The machine is planned to be closed after the consultation process will have been finalized.
"Paper markets globally have been declining consistently over the past 10 years. UPM Communication Papers has responded to this development by selective capacity reductions, always considering the competitiveness of our business - and we will continue to do so also in future. The planned closure announced today is in line with this approach and focuses on maintaining the most modern and competitive assets," says Winfried Schaur, Executive Vice President, UPM Communication Papers.
"UPM Communication Papers has maintained the position of a leading supplier of magazine papers globally. Among our European coated mechanical machines Plattling PM 10 has both the lowest capacity and the highest technical age. We adjust our capacity to remain a reliable partner to our customers and will engage in a fair dialogue with employee representatives. At the same time, we will continue delivering products of the highest quality and full service at all times during this process," says Ruud van den Berg, Senior Vice President, Magazines, Merchants and Office Business at UPM Communication Papers.

On April 5, Stone Brewing Co. Executive Chairman & Co-Founder, Greg Koch, announced via a blog post on the company’s website that the San Diego-based brewery has sold its Berlin facility.
The new owners of the Stone Brewing World Bistro & Gardens - Berlin, which opened in 2016, will be Brewdog, longtime friends of Stone Brewing Co. and headquartered in Scotland.
“Awards and accolades are awesome and humbling. Unfortunately they aren’t enough. To feed a beast like Berlin, we needed volume,” the entry read. “The sheer cost of building and maintaining Stone Berlin to our standards didn’t let us grow it slowly. Sometimes you gotta realize when your dream is becoming a threat to your greater good.”
In a statement, Lizzie Young, senior manager of public relations for Stone Brewing Co., said:
“The craft beer market is much newer in Europe and our Stone Brewing World Bistro & Gardens – Berlin was exceptionally ambitious in its size and distance from the city center. Here in the US, Stone remains the largest employer in the craft brewing community and our sales volume continues to increase year-over-year… It’s business as usual around here.”
Koch also wrote that Stone, available in 26 countries, will continue to be distributed around Europe. He added that the Stone Brewing Tap Room Prenzlauerberg will continue to operate.
Stone Brewing World Bistro & Gardens – Berlin will remain open until the end of April.

BERLIN (AP) — German government statistics show crime dropped in the country last year, including violent offenses.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said as he presented an annual crime report on Tuesday that "every crime is one too many, but objectively, this is the lowest level in decades."
Police agencies recorded more than 5.6 million cases in 2018, 3.6 percent fewer than in 2017. They included 185,377 violent crimes, a 1.9 percent decrease from the year before.
Despite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.
The overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent. The clearance rate for solved murder and manslaughter cases was 96.1%.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.
Affordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\'t think that is the right solution. He said "the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available."
Andres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a "false solution."


Germany mulls new rules to boost organ donations
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s health minister is launching a drive to tackle a shortage of donor organs with a reform that would make most people potential organ donors unless they object.
At present, doctors in Germany can transplant organs only from people who actively register and carry a donor card. Under the new system proposed Monday by Health Minister Jens Spahn and cross-party supporters, people would automatically be considered as donors unless they opt out by putting themselves on a register saying they object — which they could do at any time.
Relatives could also tell officials that the deceased made clear they didn\'t want to donate.
Spahn said 20 other European Union countries have similar systems and "everything we have tried so far hasn\'t led to a rise in donor figures."


Germany charges Afghan man with war crimes
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they\'ve charged a 26-year-old former Afghan officer with war crimes for allegedly abusing prisoners and defiling the corpse of a man he boasted he\'d "killed like a donkey."
Ahmad Zaheer D., whose last name wasn\'t given in line with privacy laws, is accused of shaking two prisoners by the hair during an interrogation around late 2013 and punching one, while another soldier hit a third with a hose.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that the suspect brought the corpse of a high-ranking enemy commander into a town in March 2014, telling villagers he\'d killed him and putting a meat hook into the corpse\'s head, then stringing the body up with a rope.
He was arrested Oct. 25 near Munich. It wasn\'t clear when he came to Germany.


Germany: 70-year-old babysitter guilty of killing boy
\r

\t \r
\r
\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — A court in Germany has found a 70-year-old babysitter guilty of manslaughter for the killing of a 7-year-old boy she was looking after.
Judges at the regional court in the southwestern city of Heilbronn sentenced the woman Monday to 10 years and six months in prison.
The trained nurse, who had been the boy\'s babysitter for several years and who he called "Grandma Elisabeth," had strangled the child while he was staying the night at her home.
Judges rejected the defense lawyer\'s arguments that his client, whose full name wasn\'t released because of German privacy rules, had killed the boy by accident, though they did take into consideration that she might have been suffering from depression and been overwhelmed by stress.

BERLIN (AP) — Police in northern Germany say they have detained a 17-year-old boy with several knives after being tipped off to an online chat in which someone threatened to kill several people at a school.
Officers checked students entering the school in Flensburg, just south of the Danish border, on Wednesday morning and detained the German teenager.

Lessons were held as normal after boy was detained.

BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they have indicted two Indian citizens for spying on the Sikh opposition and Kashmiri separatists in Germany.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that 50-year-old Manmohan S. is accused of providing information to India\'s foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, from January 2015 onward.
His wife, 51-year-old Kanwal Jit K., allegedly also began cooperating with the spy agency starting in July 2017. Their full names weren\'t released due to German privacy rules.
Prosecutors said the couple is accused of receiving a total of 7,200 euros (about $8,100) for the information they provided to their handler, who was stationed in Germany.


Germany says emissions dropped in 2018 amid warm weather
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — The German government says greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2% in 2018, the first major decrease in four years.
Estimates published Tuesday by the Environment Ministry show Germany released the equivalent of 868.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, 38 million less than 2017.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Germany benefited from 2018\'s warm and sunny weather, which increased production of renewable energy and reduced the need for heating fuel.
Germany\'s emissions last year were about 30.6 percent lower than in 1990. The country aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent from that baseline year by 2030 as part of efforts to curb climate change.
Cabinet is debating a bill that could set legally binding emissions goals for each sector of the economy.

BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s environment minister says the government will discuss introducing a carbon tax as part of its national plan to curb climate change.
Speaking after the first meeting of a special "climate Cabinet," German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Wednesday that government ministers would, over the coming months, put forward proposals for cutting greenhouse gases in the areas they oversee.
Germany\'s transport ministry opposes sector-specific targets, but Schulze insisted "everyone will have to shoulder some of the responsibility."
She also displayed openness to some kind of carbon tax. Other countries have already introduced carbon pricing to discourage the burning of fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases and stoke global warming.
Schulze said of such carbon taxes that "there are many different models that will also be debated in Cabinet."


Germany extends African missions another year
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r

\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s Cabinet has approved extending Germany\'s military missions in Africa for another year.
The dpa news agency reported Wednesday that that includes German troops taking part in a European Union training mission in Mali known as EUTM, and the United Nations "Minusma" peacekeeping force there.
Dpa reports the Cabinet also plans to extend Germany\'s commitment to the EU\'s anti-piracy mission Atalanta that operates off the Horn of Africa, but to reduce its maximum troop numbers from 600 to 400. There are currently 80 troops taking part.
Germany currently has some 180 troops involved in the EUTM mission, with a maximum of 350. A further 900 are in Mali and Niger as part of the Minusma force, with a maximum of 1,100.
Those troop commitments are to remain unchanged.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel has received former U.S. President Barack Obama at her office in Berlin for a meeting characterized by German officials as a routine private encounter with a former international peer.
Obama could be seen waving as he left the chancellery alongside Merkel Friday. Merkel\'s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she has met repeatedly with ex-heads of state and government "with whom she worked together closely and well for a time."
He said the meeting has no implications for current German-U.S. relations. Asked whether it was a signal to President Donald Trump, with whom Germany has a sometimes-complicated relationship, Seibert replied: "I would firmly reject that impression."
Merkel and Obama have already met in Berlin since the former president left office, participating in a discussion at a May 2017 conference.

BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have indicted a Sri Lankan man suspected of involvement in killing 15 captured government soldiers while fighting for the Tamil Tigers rebel group.
Federal prosecutors said Friday that 37-year-old Sivatheeban B. is accused of membership in a foreign terrorist organization, war crimes, two cases of manslaughter and 11 cases of attempted manslaughter.
The man, whose surname wasn\'t released due to German privacy rules, was arrested in August.
Prosecutors allege that in 2008 the suspect guarded 15 captured soldiers as they were driven to a site where they were executed, and later helped burn their bodies. In a separate incident a year later, he fired on 13 soldiers, two of whom died.
The rebel group, which fought for a separate state for ethnic minority Tamils, was defeated in 2009.

The legal change in the tiny, oil-rich monarchy, which also includes amputation for theft, is due to come into force Wednesday.
Human rights group Amnesty International has slammed the punishments as "vicious ."

BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have carried out raids on groups suspected of helping the militant Palestinian group Hamas under the guise of providing humanitarian aid.
The interior ministry said some 90 properties across Germany associated with an "Islamist network" were searched on Wednesday. It said the network was headed by two groups based in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, WWR Help and Ansaar International.
The ministry said there are indications that the network provided financial and propaganda support to Hamas, a longtime enemy of Israel that runs the Gaza Strip and was listed as a terror group by the European Union in 2001.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that "anyone who supports Hamas under the cover of humanitarian aid flouts fundamental value judgments of our constitution."

MILAN (AP) — The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says it is asking Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a safe port for the 64 migrants it rescued off Libya earlier this week.
Sea-Watch spokesman Carlotta Weibl said Friday that the rescue boat Alan Kurdi remains in international waters off Lampedusa and will not approach Italy\'s southernmost island until it has permission.
She said conditions on board were worsening and that a storm was approaching. She said a request has been made to the German foreign ministry to find a solution.
Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers to pack unseaworthy rubber dinghies with migrants looking for sanctuary in Europe.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s Cabinet has approved extending Germany\'s military missions in Africa for another year.
The dpa news agency reported Wednesday that that includes German troops taking part in a European Union training mission in Mali known as EUTM, and the United Nations "Minusma" peacekeeping force there.
Dpa reports the Cabinet also plans to extend Germany\'s commitment to the EU\'s anti-piracy mission Atalanta that operates off the Horn of Africa, but to reduce its maximum troop numbers from 600 to 400. There are currently 80 troops taking part.
Germany currently has some 180 troops involved in the EUTM mission, with a maximum of 350. A further 900 are in Mali and Niger as part of the Minusma force, with a maximum of 1,100.
Those troop commitments are to remain unchanged.

BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they\'ve charged a 26-year-old former Afghan officer with war crimes for allegedly abusing prisoners and defiling the corpse of a man he boasted he\'d "killed like a donkey."
Ahmad Zaheer D., whose last name wasn\'t given in line with privacy laws, is accused of shaking two prisoners by the hair during an interrogation around late 2013 and punching one, while another soldier hit a third with a hose.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that the suspect brought the corpse of a high-ranking enemy commander into a town in March 2014, telling villagers he\'d killed him and putting a meat hook into the corpse\'s head, then stringing the body up with a rope.
He was arrested Oct. 25 near Munich. It wasn\'t clear when he came to Germany.

BERLIN (AP) — A court in Germany has found a 70-year-old babysitter guilty of manslaughter for the killing of a 7-year-old boy she was looking after.
Judges at the regional court in the southwestern city of Heilbronn sentenced the woman Monday to 10 years and six months in prison.
The trained nurse, who had been the boy\'s babysitter for several years and who he called "Grandma Elisabeth," had strangled the child while he was staying the night at her home.
Judges rejected the defense lawyer\'s arguments that his client, whose full name wasn\'t released because of German privacy rules, had killed the boy by accident, though they did take into consideration that she might have been suffering from depression and been overwhelmed by stress.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.
Affordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\'t think that is the right solution. He said "the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available."
Andres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a "false solution."

BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s environment minister says the government will discuss introducing a carbon tax as part of its national plan to curb climate change.
Speaking after the first meeting of a special "climate Cabinet," German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Wednesday that government ministers would, over the coming months, put forward proposals for cutting greenhouse gases in the areas they oversee.
Germany\'s transport ministry opposes sector-specific targets, but Schulze insisted "everyone will have to shoulder some of the responsibility."
She also displayed openness to some kind of carbon tax. Other countries have already introduced carbon pricing to discourage the burning of fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases and stoke global warming.
Schulze said of such carbon taxes that "there are many different models that will also be debated in Cabinet."


Germany mulls new rules to boost organ donations
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s health minister is launching a drive to tackle a shortage of donor organs with a reform that would make most people potential organ donors unless they object.
At present, doctors in Germany can transplant organs only from people who actively register and carry a donor card. Under the new system proposed Monday by Health Minister Jens Spahn and cross-party supporters, people would automatically be considered as donors unless they opt out by putting themselves on a register saying they object — which they could do at any time.
Relatives could also tell officials that the deceased made clear they didn\'t want to donate.
Spahn said 20 other European Union countries have similar systems and "everything we have tried so far hasn\'t led to a rise in donor figures."

BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they have indicted two Indian citizens for spying on the Sikh opposition and Kashmiri separatists in Germany.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that 50-year-old Manmohan S. is accused of providing information to India\'s foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, from January 2015 onward.
His wife, 51-year-old Kanwal Jit K., allegedly also began cooperating with the spy agency starting in July 2017. Their full names weren\'t released due to German privacy rules.
Prosecutors said the couple is accused of receiving a total of 7,200 euros (about $8,100) for the information they provided to their handler, who was stationed in Germany.

Officers checked students entering the school in Flensburg, just south of the Danish border, on Wednesday morning and detained the German teenager.

Lessons were held as normal after boy was detained.

BERLIN (AP) — German government statistics show crime dropped in the country last year, including violent offenses.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said as he presented an annual crime report on Tuesday that "every crime is one too many, but objectively, this is the lowest level in decades."
Police agencies recorded more than 5.6 million cases in 2018, 3.6 percent fewer than in 2017. They included 185,377 violent crimes, a 1.9 percent decrease from the year before.
Despite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.
The overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent. The clearance rate for solved murder and manslaughter cases was 96.1%.


Germany says emissions dropped in 2018 amid warm weather
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
BERLIN (AP) — The German government says greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2% in 2018, the first major decrease in four years.
Estimates published Tuesday by the Environment Ministry show Germany released the equivalent of 868.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, 38 million less than 2017.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Germany benefited from 2018\'s warm and sunny weather, which increased production of renewable energy and reduced the need for heating fuel.
Germany\'s emissions last year were about 30.6 percent lower than in 1990. The country aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent from that baseline year by 2030 as part of efforts to curb climate change.
Cabinet is debating a bill that could set legally binding emissions goals for each sector of the economy.

BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have carried out raids on groups suspected of helping the militant Palestinian group Hamas under the guise of providing humanitarian aid.
The interior ministry said some 90 properties across Germany associated with an "Islamist network" were searched on Wednesday. It said the network was headed by two groups based in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, WWR Help and Ansaar International.
The ministry said there are indications that the network provided financial and propaganda support to Hamas, a longtime enemy of Israel that runs the Gaza Strip and was listed as a terror group by the European Union in 2001.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that "anyone who supports Hamas under the cover of humanitarian aid flouts fundamental value judgments of our constitution."

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.
Affordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\'t think that is the right solution. He said "the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available."
Andres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a "false solution."

Germany says emissions dropped in 2018 amid warm weather
BERLIN (AP) — The German government says greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2% in 2018, the first major decrease in four years.

Estimates published Tuesday by the Environment Ministry show Germany released the equivalent of 868.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, 38 million less than 2017.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Germany benefited from 2018\'s warm and sunny weather, which increased production of renewable energy and reduced the need for heating fuel.
Germany\'s emissions last year were about 30.6 percent lower than in 1990. The country aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent from that baseline year by 2030 as part of efforts to curb climate change.
Cabinet is debating a bill that could set legally binding emissions goals for each sector of the economy.

BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors say they\'ve charged a 26-year-old former Afghan officer with war crimes for allegedly abusing prisoners and defiling the corpse of a man he boasted he\'d "killed like a donkey."
Ahmad Zaheer D., whose last name wasn\'t given in line with privacy laws, is accused of shaking two prisoners by the hair during an interrogation around late 2013 and punching one, while another soldier hit a third with a hose.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that the suspect brought the corpse of a high-ranking enemy commander into a town in March 2014, telling villagers he\'d killed him and putting a meat hook into the corpse\'s head, then stringing the body up with a rope.
He was arrested Oct. 25 near Munich. It wasn\'t clear when he came to Germany.

BERLIN (AP) — Germany\'s environment minister says the government will discuss introducing a carbon tax as part of its national plan to curb climate change.
Speaking after the first meeting of a special "climate Cabinet," German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Wednesday that government ministers would, over the coming months, put forward proposals for cutting greenhouse gases in the areas they oversee.
Germany\'s transport ministry opposes sector-specific targets, but Schulze insisted "everyone will have to shoulder some of the responsibility."
She also displayed openness to some kind of carbon tax. Other countries have already introduced carbon pricing to discourage the burning of fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases and stoke global warming.
Schulze said of such carbon taxes that "there are many different models that will also be debated in Cabinet."
