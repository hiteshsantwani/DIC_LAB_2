MILAN (AP) — EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Tuesday that he is "slightly concerned" over Italy\'s slowing economy, and expressed hope that the government would take action to accelerate growth.
"Italian authorities must make supplementary efforts to keep growth alive in Italy," Juncker said at a joint press conference with Premier Giuseppe Conte.
Juncker noted that when the EU approved Italy\'s controversial budget expanding social spending, the commission projected Italian growth at 1.2 percent for 2019.
Italy has since fallen into a technical recession, and various bodies have lowered growth estimates for the year, including Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which says Italy\'s economy is likely to contract 0.2 percent this year.
In its report this week, the OECD called for bold reforms to tackle low productivity as well as social and regional inequalities.
The OECD was especially critical of the basic income scheme backed by the 5-Star Movement, saying it risks weakening work incentives and creating poverty traps given the relatively high payments compared with similar schemes in other member states.
Conte said that his government this week would approve a decree "with measures that will give impulse to growth."
But he also said that the slowdown was expected, "and that is why we conceived of a budget that wants to follow expansive but responsible policies, approving measures that the country needed for too long to re-establish social equality."

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — A Lithuanian man flying to Italy got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane: He was the only passenger on the Boeing 737-800.
Skirmantas Strimaitis, who was flying from capital Vilnius to the northern Italian city of Bergamo for a skiing holiday March 16, had the whole plane — which can usually sit up to 188 people — to himself. The only others onboard were two pilots and five crew members.
The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one.
Strimaitis told The Associated Press Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was "a once in the lifetime experience."


Italy: Candidate says public racism a symptom of social ill
MILAN (AP) — A mayoral candidate in Italy says a cousin of hers was threatened on a public tram in Florence because of the color of his skin.

Antonella Bundu, who was born in Florence to parents from Sierra Leone, said in a Facebook post on Monday that "a fascist gang" accosted her cousin with both racial insults and death threats.
Bundu says other passengers in the rail car came to his defense.
She wrote the experience shook up her cousin "because if a fascist gang felt they could act in broad daylight, in public, that means that something isn\'t right, and that this climate of hatred must be stopped before it is too late."
The current mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, says police are reviewing video footage to try to identify the aggressors.

MILAN (AP) — Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte has inaugurated the twisting 44-story Generali Tower designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid.
The 190-meter (623-foot) tower, which will serve as a headquarters for the Italian insurance company Generali, was dedicated Tuesday on the first day of the annual Milan Furniture Fair that celebrates design.
The Generali Tower is one of three skyscrapers that punctuate "CityLife," a redevelopment project of the old fair grounds that incorporates parks, apartments, offices and a vast shopping area. The other towers were designed by Daniel Libeskind and Arata Isozaki.
Hadid\'s tower twists as it rises, with the upper floors facing Milan\'s centerpiece Duomo cathedral in the center of the city.
Generali chairman Gabriele Galateri called the tower "a true element of development for Milan," with a focus on sustainability.

MILAN (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line vice premier is meeting with like-minded leaders of European right-wing party as he seeks to form a broad alliance ahead of the European elections next month.
Matteo Salvini of the the anti-migrant League says that the coalition that he is forming with Marine Le Pen, leader of France\'s far-right National Rally, "will be a great event for Europe for the next 30 years."
Salvini is meeting Monday in Milan with leaders of the Danish People\'s Party, The Finns Party and Alternative for Germany.
Peter Kofod Poulsen, the Danish People\'s Party\'s top candidate for the European Parliament elections, said in a statement that the parties are looking to form a new group of parties with common interests after the European-wide elections next month.


Another infant boy in Italy dies after home circumcision
\r

\t\r
ROME (AP) — The Italian news agency ANSA is reporting that another infant boy has died in Italy as the result of a circumcision performed at home.
ANSA reported the newborn died overnight near the port city of Genoa after his Nigerian mother and grandmother called for emergency medical help.
A 5-month-old baby died last month in Bologna after his parents performed a circumcision at home, and a 2-year-old boy died of severe blood loss as a result of a botched circumcision in Rome last December.
Circumcision is not practiced among Italy\'s Roman Catholic majority. Many immigrants in Italy are Muslim and practice circumcision for cultural and religious reasons, but sometimes have trouble accessing the practice in hospitals either for cost or because some doctors refuse to perform circumcisions until boys are at least 4.

Air Italy lands at SFO with nonstops, low fares to Milan

TravelSkills on SFGate is brought to you by Visa
.
San Francisco International Airport is once again connected to Italy with nonstop flights after newcomer Air Italy landed on Wednesday afternoon from Milan\'s Malpensa Airport (MXP).
Flights operate four times a week on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays on the carrier\'s fleet of Airbus A330-200 wide body jets.
The 5,947-mile nonstop takes off from SFO at 7:10 p.m. and arrives at the airline\'s hub in Milan at 4:05 p.m. the following day. On the return, the flight departs Milan at 1:35 p.m. and arrive SFO at 5:10 p.m. Flight times are about 12-hours each way.
For a one-week itinerary in mid-June, we found Air Italy fares in the neighborhood of $1,200 round-trip per person in the carrier\'s basic economy fare class. That\'s the fare without checked bags, advance seat selection, and lots of fees if you want to change flights. The itinerary jumps to around $1,450,00 with all those extra benefits included. That\'s a pretty good deal for a summer flight to Italy! Late August fares dip down to around $900 round trip. And in October, they are as cheap as $619 round trip.
In business class, fares range between $4,000-$5,000 round-trip-- about half of what you\'d pay on British Airways or Lufthansa for a one stop business class flight across the pond.
SFO last saw regularly scheduled non-stop flights to Italy in 2001 when Alitalia flew between San Francisco and Milan with a Boeing 767-300. In 2015, Alitalia\'s chairman, Luca di Montezemolo, laid out plans to relaunch service to SFO, but so far, we\'ve yet to see the ailing Italian flag carrier return.
Norwegian Air\'s service between Oakland and Rome\'s Fiumicino Airport is the Bay Area\'s only other non-stop flight to Italy.
Air Italy is Europe\'s newest airline after undergoing a major rebranding in 2017-2018. The carrier was formerly called Meridiana, but new owners gave it a new name, paint job, and ambitious plans to compete against Alitalia.
Its heavy use of the maroon color should look familiar — it\'s a similar hue to what is found on Qatar Airways\' jets. The uniforms worn by Air Italy\'s cabin crew have a striking resemblance to those worn by Qatar\'s too. (See the slideshow at the top of this post for a look inside the plane)
The Gulf carrier, known for its deep pockets, now owns 49 percent of Air Italy — and the company is not shy about exerting its influence or its wealth. For example, its inaugural flight celebration will be held today at the tony Ritz-Carlton, San Francisco on Nob Hill.
Check out the spaghetti-noodle-like approach the Air Italy inaugural flight took as it approached SFO yesterday-- a brilliantly clear day for a low and slow pass over the Golden Gate Bridge and the city. (Read more about these special "Bay Tour" approach flights here.)

Air Italy\'s crazy spaghetti noodle inaugural approach to SFO...
Each Air Italy A330 has 24 business class seats arranged in a 2-2-2 configuration. These seats recline into a 180-degree sleeping surface, but unlike most other carriers, they are slightly angled. Many early generation business class lie-flat seats were angled to maximize space, but most carriers have phased those products out as passengers frequently complain and sliding down the slight incline while sleeping.
In the back, there are 236 economy seats arranged 2-4-2 abreast, each with 31-inches of pitch. Air Italy does not offer a premium economy or extra-legroom economy cabin, as many other airlines flying transatlantic do. All seats come with seat back monitors with free TV and movies, and a universal power outlet. Check out Air Italy\'s A330 seat map on SeatGuru.
Satellite wifi is available for purchase with plans starting at 3 euros (roughly $3.50) for 20MBs of data. A top-tier internet plan of 21 euros (roughly $23.66) gives you 180MBs, but heavy internet browsers might burn though those amounts quickly. More here.

San Francisco is the latest in Air Italy\'s expansion plans. Last week, it launched four times weekly service to Los Angeles, and next month, Air Italy will begin serving Toronto. In the U.S., Air Italy also flies to New York\'s John F. Kennedy Airport and Miami. Air Italy\'s IATA code is: IG.
From its Milan hub, Air Italy flies several domestic routes providing connections to Rome, Naples, Palermo, Catania, Lamezia Terme and soon Cagliari, the capital city of the picturesque Italian island of Sardinia. The carrier also flies to several cities in the Middle East and Africa, including Accra, Cairo, Dakar, and Lagos.
The carrier has grand plans to add at least 20 addition jets in the coming years, but for the time being, it operates a rather modest fleet, with just five Airbus A330s, five Boeing 737 Next Generation jets, and three Boeing 737 MAXs. The entire MAX fleet has been grounded because of the well-publicized issues surrounding that particular plane.

In route news this week, Air Italy will kick off San Francisco-Milan service in a few days; Maui gets new Southwest service from Oakland and Hawaiian flights from Sacramento; Delta upgrades LAX-Sydney aircraft; new routes to Korea launched from Minneapolis and Boston; The "big move" is on this weekend in Istanbul; Delta and Virgin Atlantic will add new routes to London next year; American begins flying its first new A321neo; Air France begins DFW flights; Ethiopian is coming to Houston and Royal Air Maroc starts Miami service; United debuts its new Polaris cabin from Newark to Hong Kong; Air Canada delays some new U.S. routes; and Colombia\'s Avianca shrinks its U.S. network.
After launching new service on April 3 between Los Angeles International and Milan Malpensa four times a week, Air Italy will do the same at San Francisco International on Tuesday (April 10) also with four weekly roundtrips. Flights will depart SFO at 7:10 p.m. on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, arriving at Malpensa the following afternoon. The carrier is using an Airbus A330-200 on the route, with 24 almost-lie-flat business class seats configured 2-2-2 and 228 economy seats in a 2-4-2 layout. Air Italy, backed by the deep pockets of Qatar Airways, also flies to New York JFK and Miami.
At Oakland, Southwest Airlines is due to kick off its second Hawaii route on April 7, introducing daily roundtrips to Kahului, Maui. The airline\'s first Hawaii route, Oakland to Honolulu, began on March 17. Next month, Southwest takes its Hawaii action to San Jose, with plans to launch SJC-Honolulu service May 5, followed by SJC-Maui on May 26. At Sacramento, meanwhile, Hawaiian Airlines this week inaugurated new daily service to Kahului. Hawaiian is using one of its new A321neos on the route with 16 first class seats, 44 Extra Comfort premium economy seats and 129 in the main cabin. (On the East Coast, meanwhile, Hawaiian on Friday started Boston-Honolulu non-stop A330 service -- the country\'s longest non-stop domestic route at 5,095 miles.)
Delta this week deployed one of its newly "refreshed" 777-200ERs on the Los Angeles-Sydney route. The overhauled aircraft offers all four of the airline\'s international seating products, including the Delta One business class, featuring 28 individual suites with privacy doors; the airline\'s new Premium Select premium economy cabin, with 48 seats; 90 extra-legroom Comfort+ seats and 112 main cabin seats (configured nine-across instead of 10), for a total passenger capacity of 296. The aircraft also has LED ambient lighting and seatback screens throughout with access to the Delta Studio lineup of free entertainment.
Elsewhere, Delta this week began new daily transpacific service from Minneapolis-St. Paul to Seoul Incheon as part of its joint venture partnership with Korean Air. That 13-hour flight also uses a refurbished 777-200ER. And to supplement Delta\'s fast-growing presence at Boston Logan, Korean Air on April 12 will start flying from there to Seoul as part of the joint venture operation. Korean will use a 787-9 Dreamliner to fly the route five days a week.
Delta also announced this week that it will offer a new U.K. option next summer as part of its joint venture partnership with Virgin Atlantic. That new option will be daily flights from both Boston and New York JFK to London\'s Gatwick Airport. Together with the two carriers\' London Heathrow flights, that will give Delta/Virgin a total of 18 daily flights from Boston and New York to London. "Full Gatwick schedule details will be announced later this year," Delta said. The carrier is also upgrading aircraft on Boston-LHR flights this week with an Airbus A330-200, which it already uses on its JFK-LHR route. And starting in November, Delta said, it will deploy refurbished 767-400s on both Heathrow routes, offering Delta One, Premium Select, Comfort+ and main cabin seating options.
This just in from Turkish Airlines: "Turkish Airlines started its great move to Istanbul Airport, the biggest airport project in the world. Following the first opening stage last October, the great move has begun as of 03:00 today. Unique in the global aviation history, the moving operation will take 45 hours in total and will conclude on Saturday, April 6 at 23:59. [The new] Istanbul Airport and [the existing] Ataturk Airport will be closed for all passenger flights during a 12-hour period between the final Turkish Airlines passenger flight departing from Ataturk Airport to Singapore on Saturday, April 6 at 02:00 and the flight from Istanbul Airport to Ankara Esenboga Airport at 14:00 the same day. Following that, the Turkish Airlines flights from Istanbul Airport will be increased in stages according to a set plan." The airline also announced that the new airport will get the old airport\'s IATA code: IST. The older Ataturk airport code will switch to ISL.
American Airlines this week started flying its first brand-new Airbus A321neo on the Phoenix-Orlando route. It has a total of 100 A321neos on order and will phase them in on the Phoenix-Anchorage route this summer and from LAX and Phoenix to Hawaii later this year, replacing 757s. The new engines on these planes will give them about 400 nautical miles of additional range compared with older A321s, American said. AA\'s new "neos" will carry 196 passengers; its current A321s have a capacity of 181 or 187, depending on the model (not counting its A321Ts, which are specially configured for prime transcontinental routes with both a first class and business class cabin; those aircraft have a capacity of just 108 passengers). The new A321s will be equipped with ViaSat Wi-Fi, streaming entertainment including live TV, and with Airbus\' XL overhead bins, which "significantly increase capacity." Its existing A321 fleet will also have those larger bins installed starting later this year, AA said.
In other route news, American this week started new service from Los Angeles International to Louisville, Kentucky, using a 128-seat A319; the eastbound segment is a red-eye, departing LAX at 10:55 p.m. And beginning October 27, American will lay on a second daily departure from Miami to London Heathrow.

Air France this week kicked off new Paris CDG-Dallas/Ft. Worth service, with plans to operate up to five flights a week through the summer season. Air France is using an A330 with 36 fully flat seats in business class, 21 in premium economy and 167 in the main cabin. And the French carrier also put a jumbo 516-seat Airbus A380 into service this week on one of its two daily Atlanta-Paris CDG flights. The other flight uses a 777.
Effective this week, United Airlines\' Newark-Hong Kong route is using a 777-300ER offering its new Polaris business class with 60 lie-flat seats as well as its Premium Plus premium economy cabin. Last year, United opened a Polaris lounge at Newark for international passengers in its new front cabin.
On June 23, Ethiopian Airlines will add Houston Bush Intercontinental as a new U.S. gateway, using a 787-8 Dreamliner to operate three flights a week to Addis Ababa. The new Houston service will operate via a stop in Lome, Togo. In other Africa route news, Royal Air Maroc this week started flying from Miami to Casablanca, using 787 Dreamliners to operate three flights a week.
In the Western Hemisphere, Air Canada is blaming the 737MAX grounding for some changes to its transborder schedule. Seasonal service from Portland to Toronto has been pushed back from May 24 to July 1 and Vancouver-Boston service has been delayed from June 1 to June 16. And Colombia\'s Avianca is making some serious cuts to its U.S. service. On May 1, Avianca will discontinue Boston-Bogota, Chicago-Bogota and New York JFK-Cartagena flights, and on June 1 it will discontinue service from Boston to San Salvador and flights from Chicago, New York JFK and Orlando to Guatemala City.

\t
ROME (AP) — The Italian news agency ANSA is reporting that another infant boy has died in Italy as the result of a circumcision performed at home.
\t
ANSA reported the newborn died overnight near the port city of Genoa after his Nigerian mother and grandmother called for emergency medical help.
\t
\t
A 5-month-old baby died last month in Bologna after his parents performed a circumcision at home, and a 2-year-old boy died of severe blood loss as a result of a botched circumcision in Rome last December.
\t
Circumcision is not practiced among Italy\'s Roman Catholic majority. Many immigrants in Italy are Muslim and practice circumcision for cultural and religious reasons, but sometimes have trouble accessing the practice in hospitals either for cost or because some doctors refuse to perform circumcisions until boys are at least 4.


\t
MILAN (AP) — A mayoral candidate in Italy says a cousin of hers was threatened on a public tram in Florence because of the color of his skin.
\t
Antonella Bundu, who was born in Florence to parents from Sierra Leone, said in a Facebook post on Monday that "a fascist gang" accosted her cousin with both racial insults and death threats.
\t
\t
Bundu says other passengers in the rail car came to his defense.
\t
She wrote the experience shook up her cousin "because if a fascist gang felt they could act in broad daylight, in public, that means that something isn\'t right, and that this climate of hatred must be stopped before it is too late."
\t
The current mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, says police are reviewing video footage to try to identify the aggressors.


\t
VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — A Lithuanian man flying to Italy got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane: He was the only passenger on the Boeing 737-800.
\t
Skirmantas Strimaitis, who was flying from capital Vilnius to the northern Italian city of Bergamo for a skiing holiday March 16, had the whole plane — which can usually sit up to 188 people — to himself. The only others onboard were two pilots and five crew members.
\t
\t
\t
The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one.
\t
Strimaitis told The Associated Press Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was "a once in the lifetime experience."


\t
MILAN (AP) — EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Tuesday that he is "slightly concerned" over Italy\'s slowing economy, and expressed hope that the government would take action to accelerate growth.
\t
\t
"Italian authorities must make supplementary efforts to keep growth alive in Italy," Juncker said at a joint press conference with Premier Giuseppe Conte.
\t
\t
Juncker noted that when the EU approved Italy\'s controversial budget expanding social spending, the commission projected Italian growth at 1.2 percent for 2019.
\t
Italy has since fallen into a technical recession, and various bodies have lowered growth estimates for the year, including Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which says Italy\'s economy is likely to contract 0.2 percent this year.
\t
In its report this week, the OECD called for bold reforms to tackle low productivity as well as social and regional inequalities.
\t
The OECD was especially critical of the basic income scheme backed by the 5-Star Movement, saying it risks weakening work incentives and creating poverty traps given the relatively high payments compared with similar schemes in other member states.
\t
Conte said that his government this week would approve a decree "with measures that will give impulse to growth."
\t
But he also said that the slowdown was expected, "and that is why we conceived of a budget that wants to follow expansive but responsible policies, approving measures that the country needed for too long to re-establish social equality."


\t
MILAN (AP) — Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte has inaugurated the twisting 44-story Generali Tower designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid.
\t
The 190-meter (623-foot) tower, which will serve as a headquarters for the Italian insurance company Generali, was dedicated Tuesday on the first day of the annual Milan Furniture Fair that celebrates design.
\t
\t
The Generali Tower is one of three skyscrapers that punctuate "CityLife," a redevelopment project of the old fair grounds that incorporates parks, apartments, offices and a vast shopping area. The other towers were designed by Daniel Libeskind and Arata Isozaki.
\t
\t
Hadid\'s tower twists as it rises, with the upper floors facing Milan\'s centerpiece Duomo cathedral in the center of the city.
\t
Generali chairman Gabriele Galateri called the tower "a true element of development for Milan," with a focus on sustainability.


\t
MILAN (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line vice premier is meeting with like-minded leaders of European right-wing party as he seeks to form a broad alliance ahead of the European elections next month.
\t
\t
Matteo Salvini of the the anti-migrant League says that the coalition that he is forming with Marine Le Pen, leader of France\'s far-right National Rally, "will be a great event for Europe for the next 30 years."
\t
\t
Salvini is meeting Monday in Milan with leaders of the Danish People\'s Party, The Finns Party and Alternative for Germany.
\t
Peter Kofod Poulsen, the Danish People\'s Party\'s top candidate for the European Parliament elections, said in a statement that the parties are looking to form a new group of parties with common interests after the European-wide elections next month.

Italy: Candidate says public racism a symptom of social ill
MILAN (AP) — A mayoral candidate in Italy says a cousin of hers was threatened on a public tram in Florence because of the color of his skin.

MILAN
Juventus starlet Moise Kean has whipped up a storm by taking a stand when targeted by racist chanting during his team\'s Serie A match against Cagliari on Tuesday, but his actions raised barely a murmur in Italy, where racist abuse has become a recurring problem which football authorities remain reluctant to tackle.
Even Kean\'s Juventus teammate Leonardo Bonucci and coach Massimiliano Allegri partly blamed the 19-year-old, born in Italy to Ivorian parents, for provoking Cagliari fans with his celebrations after scoring the second goal in a 2-0 win.
Kean -- along with his French teammate Blaise Matuidi and Brazilian Alex Sandro -- had been targeted by monkey chants throughout the match, but they increased in intensity after the Italy international bagged his fourth Serie A strike of the season.
The youngster celebrated with his hands outstretched on front of the Cagliari fans, drawing a barrage of racist abuse.
World Cup winner Matuidi protested furiously at the stadium where he was targeted in January last year.
Then the Sardinian club had apologised, but this time Kean was cast as the villain, with even fellow Italian international Bonucci saying that "the blame is 50-50".
"Moise shouldn\'t have done that and the Curva (where the hardcore Cagliari fans stand) should not have reacted that way."
Afterwards Kean\'s posted on Instagram that it was "the best way to respond to racism".
Kean\'s agent Mino Raiola, who also manages Matuidi, said: "Nobody should justify racism in any way or form".
"A country like Italy should be leading on this. You cannot be racist and Italian.
"I am with my players until the end. If in the team or the club there are people who are not willing to fight racism they should be leaving."
Allegri called for the culprits to be identified and banned for life, but agreed Kean "shouldn\'t have celebrated in that manner".
"We\'ve got the technology, if the authorities want to they can identity them. The problem is, they don\'t really want to," Allegri said.
Mauro Valeri, the head of Italy\'s observatory on racism in football, believes there seems to be a reluctance to tackle the problem.
"There were already incidents at Cagliari with (Ghanian Sulley) Muntari and Matuidi," sociologist and writer Valeri told AFP.
"It concerns a small group of people, the (club) president might decide to crack down and punish, as is done in England, but he chooses to defend his fans," continued Valeri.
"It\'s easier to do that, to say that Cagliari is not a racist city, which nobody says anyway."
Bonucci\'s reaction "totally underestimates the problem of racism," added Valeri.
Kean received support from players including fellow Italian international Mario Balotelli and England\'s Raheem Sterling, who said of Bonucci\'s comments: "All you can do now is laugh."
But there has been little support in Italy, with no comments from the federation or the Italian League, nor Cagliari or Juventus.
Sports newspaper Corriere dello Sport estimated there were "a few isolated buu (monkey chants)", while the Gazzetta dello Sport counted "more whistles than buus".
"The difference with other countries is that in Italy, this issue is never faced as a real problem," said Valeri.
"For many people it is not racism and nobody wants to take responsibility for tackling what is a cultural problem.
"Even the anti-racist movements have never been interested in this problem.
"In Italy, it is more serious to insult the mother, we still have the idea that you can go to the stadium and make monkey noises for an hour and a half, then you go home and you\'re not racist."
In December, Inter Milan was punished with two games behind closed doors following sustained racist abuse of Napoli\'s Senegalese defender Kalidou Koulibaly.
But this severe sanction is more the exception than the norm. Most often, clubs get away with a fine or a suspended stand closure.


Another infant boy in Italy dies after home circumcision
ROME (AP) — The Italian news agency ANSA is reporting that another infant boy has died in Italy as the result of a circumcision performed at home.
ANSA reported the newborn died overnight near the port city of Genoa after his Nigerian mother and grandmother called for emergency medical help.
A 5-month-old baby died last month in Bologna after his parents performed a circumcision at home, and a 2-year-old boy died of severe blood loss as a result of a botched circumcision in Rome last December.
Circumcision is not practiced among Italy\'s Roman Catholic majority. Many immigrants in Italy are Muslim and practice circumcision for cultural and religious reasons, but sometimes have trouble accessing the practice in hospitals either for cost or because some doctors refuse to perform circumcisions until boys are at least 4.

MILAN (AP) — Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte has inaugurated the twisting 44-story Generali Tower designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid.
The 190-meter (623-foot) tower, which will serve as a headquarters for the Italian insurance company Generali, was dedicated Tuesday on the first day of the annual Milan Furniture Fair that celebrates design.
The Generali Tower is one of three skyscrapers that punctuate "CityLife," a redevelopment project of the old fair grounds that incorporates parks, apartments, offices and a vast shopping area. The other towers were designed by Daniel Libeskind and Arata Isozaki.
Hadid\'s tower twists as it rises, with the upper floors facing Milan\'s centerpiece Duomo cathedral in the center of the city.
Generali chairman Gabriele Galateri called the tower "a true element of development for Milan," with a focus on sustainability.

MILAN (AP) — EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Tuesday that he is "slightly concerned" over Italy\'s slowing economy, and expressed hope that the government would take action to accelerate growth.
"Italian authorities must make supplementary efforts to keep growth alive in Italy," Juncker said at a joint press conference with Premier Giuseppe Conte.
Juncker noted that when the EU approved Italy\'s controversial budget expanding social spending, the commission projected Italian growth at 1.2 percent for 2019.
Italy has since fallen into a technical recession, and various bodies have lowered growth estimates for the year, including Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which says Italy\'s economy is likely to contract 0.2 percent this year.
In its report this week, the OECD called for bold reforms to tackle low productivity as well as social and regional inequalities.
The OECD was especially critical of the basic income scheme backed by the 5-Star Movement, saying it risks weakening work incentives and creating poverty traps given the relatively high payments compared with similar schemes in other member states.
Conte said that his government this week would approve a decree "with measures that will give impulse to growth."
But he also said that the slowdown was expected, "and that is why we conceived of a budget that wants to follow expansive but responsible policies, approving measures that the country needed for too long to re-establish social equality."

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — A Lithuanian man flying to Italy got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane: He was the only passenger on the Boeing 737-800.
Skirmantas Strimaitis, who was flying from capital Vilnius to the northern Italian city of Bergamo for a skiing holiday March 16, had the whole plane — which can usually sit up to 188 people — to himself. The only others onboard were two pilots and five crew members.
The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one.
Strimaitis told The Associated Press Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was "a once in the lifetime experience."


Italy: Candidate says public racism a symptom of social ill
MILAN (AP) — A mayoral candidate in Italy says a cousin of hers was threatened on a public tram in Florence because of the color of his skin.
Antonella Bundu, who was born in Florence to parents from Sierra Leone, said in a Facebook post on Monday that "a fascist gang" accosted her cousin with both racial insults and death threats.
Bundu says other passengers in the rail car came to his defense.
She wrote the experience shook up her cousin "because if a fascist gang felt they could act in broad daylight, in public, that means that something isn\'t right, and that this climate of hatred must be stopped before it is too late."
The current mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, says police are reviewing video footage to try to identify the aggressors.

ROME (AP) — The Italian news agency ANSA is reporting that another infant boy has died in Italy as the result of a circumcision performed at home.
ANSA reported the newborn died overnight near the port city of Genoa after his Nigerian mother and grandmother called for emergency medical help.
A 5-month-old baby died last month in Bologna after his parents performed a circumcision at home, and a 2-year-old boy died of severe blood loss as a result of a botched circumcision in Rome last December.
Circumcision is not practiced among Italy\'s Roman Catholic majority. Many immigrants in Italy are Muslim and practice circumcision for cultural and religious reasons, but sometimes have trouble accessing the practice in hospitals either for cost or because some doctors refuse to perform circumcisions until boys are at least 4.

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — A Lithuanian man flying to Italy got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane: He was the only passenger on the Boeing 737-800.
Skirmantas Strimaitis, who was flying from capital Vilnius to the northern Italian city of Bergamo for a skiing holiday March 16, had the whole plane — which can usually sit up to 188 people — to himself. The only others onboard were two pilots and five crew members.
The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one.
Strimaitis told The Associated Press Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was "a once in the lifetime experience."


Another infant boy in Italy dies after home circumcision

ROME (AP) — The Italian news agency ANSA is reporting that another infant boy has died in Italy as the result of a circumcision performed at home.
ANSA reported the newborn died overnight near the port city of Genoa after his Nigerian mother and grandmother called for emergency medical help.
A 5-month-old baby died last month in Bologna after his parents performed a circumcision at home, and a 2-year-old boy died of severe blood loss as a result of a botched circumcision in Rome last December.
Circumcision is not practiced among Italy\'s Roman Catholic majority. Many immigrants in Italy are Muslim and practice circumcision for cultural and religious reasons, but sometimes have trouble accessing the practice in hospitals either for cost or because some doctors refuse to perform circumcisions until boys are at least 4.

MILAN (AP) — EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker says he is slightly concerned over Italy\'s slowing economy, and expressed hope that the government would take action to accelerate growth.
Juncker spoke Tuesday in Rome at a joint press conference with Premier Giuseppe Conte. He said that "Italian authorities must make efforts to keep growth alive in Italy."
Juncker\'s exhortations follow a report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development saying Italy\'s economy would contract 0.2 percent this year, and calling for bold reforms to tackle low productivity as well as social and regional inequalities.
The OECD report was especially critical of the basic income scheme backed by the 5-Star Movement, saying it risks weakening work incentives and creating poverty traps given the relatively high payments compared with other member states.

MILAN (AP) — Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte has inaugurated the twisting 44-story Generali Tower designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid.
The 190-meter (623-foot) tower, which will serve as a headquarters for the Italian insurance company Generali, was dedicated Tuesday on the first day of the annual Milan Furniture Fair that celebrates design.
The Generali Tower is one of three skyscrapers that punctuate "CityLife," a redevelopment project of the old fair grounds that incorporates parks, apartments, offices and a vast shopping area. The other towers were designed by Daniel Libeskind and Arata Isozaki.
Hadid\'s tower twists as it rises, with the upper floors facing Milan\'s centerpiece Duomo cathedral in the center of the city.
Generali chairman Gabriele Galateri called the tower "a true element of development for Milan," with a focus on sustainability.

Italy: Candidate says public racism a symptom of social ill
MILAN (AP) — A mayoral candidate in Italy says a cousin of hers was threatened on a public tram in Florence because of the color of his skin.
Antonella Bundu, who was born in Florence to parents from Sierra Leone, said in a Facebook post on Monday that "a fascist gang" accosted her cousin with both racial insults and death threats.
Bundu says other passengers in the rail car came to his defense.
She wrote the experience shook up her cousin "because if a fascist gang felt they could act in broad daylight, in public, that means that something isn\'t right, and that this climate of hatred must be stopped before it is too late."
The current mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, says police are reviewing video footage to try to identify the aggressors.

MILAN (AP) — EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker says he is slightly concerned over Italy\'s slowing economy, and expressed hope that the government would take action to accelerate growth.
Juncker spoke Tuesday in Rome at a joint press conference with Premier Giuseppe Conte. He said that "Italian authorities must make efforts to keep growth alive in Italy."
Juncker\'s exhortations follow a report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development saying Italy\'s economy would contract 0.2 percent this year, and calling for bold reforms to tackle low productivity as well as social and regional inequalities.
The OECD report was especially critical of the basic income scheme backed by the 5-Star Movement, saying it risks weakening work incentives and creating poverty traps given the relatively high payments compared with other member states.


Italy: Candidate says public racism a symptom of social ill
MILAN (AP) — A mayoral candidate in Italy says a cousin of hers was threatened on a public tram in Florence because of the color of his skin.
Antonella Bundu, who was born in Florence to parents from Sierra Leone, said in a Facebook post on Monday that "a fascist gang" accosted her cousin with both racial insults and death threats.
Bundu says other passengers in the rail car came to his defense.
She wrote the experience shook up her cousin "because if a fascist gang felt they could act in broad daylight, in public, that means that something isn\'t right, and that this climate of hatred must be stopped before it is too late."
The current mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, says police are reviewing video footage to try to identify the aggressors.

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — A Lithuanian man flying to Italy got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane: He was the only passenger on the Boeing 737-800.
Skirmantas Strimaitis, who was flying from capital Vilnius to the northern Italian city of Bergamo for a skiing holiday March 16, had the whole plane — which can usually sit up to 188 people — to himself. The only others onboard were two pilots and five crew members.
The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one.
Strimaitis told The Associated Press Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was "a once in the lifetime experience."

MILAN (AP) — Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte has inaugurated the twisting 44-story Generali Tower designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid.
The 190-meter (623-foot) tower, which will serve as a headquarters for the Italian insurance company Generali, was dedicated Tuesday on the first day of the annual Milan Furniture Fair that celebrates design.
The Generali Tower is one of three skyscrapers that punctuate "CityLife," a redevelopment project of the old fair grounds that incorporates parks, apartments, offices and a vast shopping area. The other towers were designed by Daniel Libeskind and Arata Isozaki.
Hadid\'s tower twists as it rises, with the upper floors facing Milan\'s centerpiece Duomo cathedral in the center of the city.
Generali chairman Gabriele Galateri called the tower "a true element of development for Milan," with a focus on sustainability.

MILAN (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line vice premier is meeting with like-minded leaders of European right-wing party as he seeks to form a broad alliance ahead of the European elections next month.
Matteo Salvini of the the anti-migrant League says that the coalition that he is forming with Marine Le Pen, leader of France\'s far-right National Rally, "will be a great event for Europe for the next 30 years."
Salvini is meeting Monday in Milan with leaders of the Danish People\'s Party, The Finns Party and Alternative for Germany.
Peter Kofod Poulsen, the Danish People\'s Party\'s top candidate for the European Parliament elections, said in a statement that the parties are looking to form a new group of parties with common interests after the European-wide elections next month.


Another infant boy in Italy dies after home circumcision
ROME (AP) — The Italian news agency ANSA is reporting that another infant boy has died in Italy as the result of a circumcision performed at home.
ANSA reported the newborn died overnight near the port city of Genoa after his Nigerian mother and grandmother called for emergency medical help.
A 5-month-old baby died last month in Bologna after his parents performed a circumcision at home, and a 2-year-old boy died of severe blood loss as a result of a botched circumcision in Rome last December.
Circumcision is not practiced among Italy\'s Roman Catholic majority. Many immigrants in Italy are Muslim and practice circumcision for cultural and religious reasons, but sometimes have trouble accessing the practice in hospitals either for cost or because some doctors refuse to perform circumcisions until boys are at least 4.

Italy is headed for zero economic growth in 2019, Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said, while brushing off possible changes to the government\'s budget.
"We face a widespread slowdown in growth across Europe, and in Italy we are headed for zero growth", Tria told an economic forum in Florence on Sunday.
Italy\'s central bank and the International Monetary Fund have both estimated that the eurozone\'s third-largest economy would expand by a meagre 0.6 percent this year, while the European Commission was more pessimistic, pencilling growth of just 0.2 percent.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Italian economy contracted owing to a slowdown in exports, plunging it into a technical recession and worsening the government\'s budget problems.
But despite pressure from EU officials to maintain fiscal discipline, Tria said: "No one is asking us for a corrective manoeuvre, so I exclude that."
The EU warned last week of a new row brewing with Italy over its budget, barely a few months after both sides agreed on a hard-fought deal with Rome\'s disputed 2019 finances.
Italy\'s public debt now sits at 2.3 trillion euros ($2.6 trillion), or 131 percent of Italy\'s GDP -- way above the 60 percent EU ceiling.
Germany, Europe\'s leading economy, is struggling at the moment owing to significantly weaker demand for its exports, and those problems have affected eurozone partners, with which it does much of its trade.
For 2018 as a whole, Italy\'s gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 0.9 percent.
Populist policies by Italy\'s coalition government have affected business investment, while consumer confidence has slumped as well.

Don\'t touch abortion law: Salvini
Several tens of thousands of people have marched in support of the ultra-conservative World Congress of Families on Sunday, on the final day of their conference in northern Italy.
Participants in the city of Verona carried pink and blue balloons and placards with slogans such as "Yes to life, not to abortion", an AFP correspondent saw.
Supporters travelled by train and coach, which came a day after protesters staged their own demonstration denouncing the organisation\'s anti-abortion, anti-gay stance.
Before the march started at around midday, those gathered listened to a message from the organisers of the Congress.they said in their closing statement.
Some marchers carried tiny rubber models that were handed out during the conference, which were intended to represent a 10-week old foetus. They came with the message: "Abortion stops a beating heart."
The three-day conference attracted senior political figures from the far-right.
The event also revealed divisions in the ruling coalition of Salvini\'s League party and the anti-Establishment Five Star Movement. But Salvini\'s coalition partner Luigi Di Maio, leader of the Five Star Movement, denounced the World Congress of Families as a gathering of "fanatics".
"The vision defended by this Congress in Verona is a vision of the world that belongs for the most part to the Middle Ages, which considers women as submissive," said De Maio.
Salvini, while backing the Congress\'s vision of a family as one composed of "a father and a mother", rejected calls by some participants to abolish Italy\'s laws.. "There\'s no debate either on abortion, or on marriage. Everyone makes love with whoever they want, and dines with whoever they want," he added.
Italy legalised civil unions between people of the same sex in 2016. Salvini has however spoken out against gay couples being allowed to adopt.
. Its credo, as stated on its website, is to "affirm, celebrate, and defend the natural family as the only fundamental and sustainable unit of society".
Previous meetings include one in Hungary, which enjoyed the patronage of the country\'s far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orban. As well as Salvini, other speakers at this year\'s event include the President of Moldova Igor Dodon -- a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Hungary\'s ultra-conservative Families Minister Katalin Novak and a senior figure in the Russian Orthodox Church, Dmitri Smirnov, were also listed as speakers. And two other Italian ministers were listed as speakers at the Congress: Lorenzo Fontana, Minister for Families and Disabilities and Education Minister Marco Busetti.

"The ECB shall approve both the operations in foreign reserve assets remaining with the NCBs (national central banks)... and Member States\' transactions with their foreign exchange working balances above a certain threshold."
"The purpose of this competence is to ensure consistency with the exchange rate and monetary policy of the Union."
Italy\'s ruling populists pushed ahead this week with efforts to seize control of the central bank and its gold reserves
"If you are here with your current account in the red, it\'s because the people who were supposed to control things didn\'t do so," League\'s leader, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, told a group of former investors in Banca Popolare di Vicenza, which was liquidated in 2017.
One law would instruct the central bank\'s owners, most of them private banks, to sell their shares to the Italian Treasury at prices from the 1930s .
.
The other law would declare the Italian people to be the owners of the Bank of Italy\'s reserve of 2451.8 metric tons of gold, worth around $102 billion at current prices.
"The gold belongs to the Italians, not to the bankers," said Giorgia Meloni, leader of the Brothers of Italy, a far-right opposition party that supports both bills. "We are ready to battle everywhere in Italy and to bring Italians to the streets if necessary."
Two weeks ago, somewhat out of the blue , ECB President Mario Draghi issued an odd statement confirming that the European Central Bank needs to approve any operation in the foreign reserves of euro zone countries, including gold and large foreign currency holdings.
Specifically,.
At the time it did not seem notable for any particular reason, but now things are starting to make more sense as The Wall Street Journal reports that.
Complaining that hundreds of thousands of small individual investors lost billions of dollars after several Italian banks failed in recent years, the anti-establishment \'5 Star Movement\' and the nationalist \'League\' depict the central bank as a symbol of a technocratic elite aloof from the needs of ordinary Italians.
said Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, leader of the 5 Star Movement.
Five Star and the League have repeatedly attacked the Bank of Italy for not preventing the banking crises, and blamed it for the losses suffered by mom-and-pop savers who had bought bank shares and bonds.
And this week saw Italian lawmakers from 5 Star asking Parliament to pass two draft laws:
As The Wall Street Journal notes , such a move could in theory widen the scope for selling the gold and reduce the bank\'s reserves, which help underpin the financial system:
The establishment sees it differently, warning that their actions are an attempt to undermine the Bank of Italy\'s independence, and to spend the nation\'s gold reserves on populist policies.
"Gold is part of the assets of the Bank of Italy and can\'t be used for monetary financing of the Treasury," said Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco.
said Gianluca Garbi, chief executive of Banca Sistema SpA.
But as The Wall Street Journal concludes, the 5 Star Movement and the League support public ownership of the gold reserves, and with backing from parties comprising 60% of lawmakers,Lawmakers from 5 Star also support nationalizing the central bank, while the League hasn\'t decided yet, leaving the bill short of a majority with around 40% support.
As of last week they had forced the creation of a parliamentary commission to look into the failure of Italian banks, launching what could be months of tense scrutiny.

MILAN (AP) — EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Tuesday that he is "slightly concerned" over Italy\'s slowing economy, and expressed hope that the government would take action to accelerate growth.
"Italian authorities must make supplementary efforts to keep growth alive in Italy," Juncker said at a joint press conference with Premier Giuseppe Conte.
Juncker noted that when the EU approved Italy\'s controversial budget expanding social spending, the commission projected Italian growth at 1.2 percent for 2019.
Italy has since fallen into a technical recession, and various bodies have lowered growth estimates for the year, including Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which says Italy\'s economy is likely to contract 0.2 percent this year.
In its report this week, the OECD called for bold reforms to tackle low productivity as well as social and regional inequalities.
The OECD was especially critical of the basic income scheme backed by the 5-Star Movement, saying it risks weakening work incentives and creating poverty traps given the relatively high payments compared with similar schemes in other member states.
Conte said that his government this week would approve a decree "with measures that will give impulse to growth."
But he also said that the slowdown was expected, "and that is why we conceived of a budget that wants to follow expansive but responsible policies, approving measures that the country needed for too long to re-establish social equality."

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — A Lithuanian man flying to Italy got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane: He was the only passenger on the Boeing 737-800.
Skirmantas Strimaitis, who was flying from capital Vilnius to the northern Italian city of Bergamo for a skiing holiday March 16, had the whole plane — which can usually sit up to 188 people — to himself. The only others onboard were two pilots and five crew members.
The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one.
Strimaitis told The Associated Press Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was "a once in the lifetime experience."


Another infant boy in Italy dies after home circumcision
ROME (AP) — The Italian news agency ANSA is reporting that another infant boy has died in Italy as the result of a circumcision performed at home.
ANSA reported the newborn died overnight near the port city of Genoa after his Nigerian mother and grandmother called for emergency medical help.
A 5-month-old baby died last month in Bologna after his parents performed a circumcision at home, and a 2-year-old boy died of severe blood loss as a result of a botched circumcision in Rome last December.
Circumcision is not practiced among Italy\'s Roman Catholic majority. Many immigrants in Italy are Muslim and practice circumcision for cultural and religious reasons, but sometimes have trouble accessing the practice in hospitals either for cost or because some doctors refuse to perform circumcisions until boys are at least 4.

MILAN (AP) — Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte has inaugurated the twisting 44-story Generali Tower designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid.
The 190-meter (623-foot) tower, which will serve as a headquarters for the Italian insurance company Generali, was dedicated Tuesday on the first day of the annual Milan Furniture Fair that celebrates design.
The Generali Tower is one of three skyscrapers that punctuate "CityLife," a redevelopment project of the old fair grounds that incorporates parks, apartments, offices and a vast shopping area. The other towers were designed by Daniel Libeskind and Arata Isozaki.
Hadid\'s tower twists as it rises, with the upper floors facing Milan\'s centerpiece Duomo cathedral in the center of the city.
Generali chairman Gabriele Galateri called the tower "a true element of development for Milan," with a focus on sustainability.

MILAN (AP) — EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker says he is slightly concerned over Italy\'s slowing economy, and expressed hope that the government would take action to accelerate growth.
Juncker spoke Tuesday in Rome at a joint press conference with Premier Giuseppe Conte. He said that "Italian authorities must make efforts to keep growth alive in Italy."
Juncker\'s exhortations follow a report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development saying Italy\'s economy would contract 0.2 percent this year, and calling for bold reforms to tackle low productivity as well as social and regional inequalities.
The OECD report was especially critical of the basic income scheme backed by the 5-Star Movement, saying it risks weakening work incentives and creating poverty traps given the relatively high payments compared with other member states.


Italy: Candidate says public racism a symptom of social ill

Antonella Bundu, who was born in Florence to parents from Sierra Leone, said in a Facebook post on Monday that "a fascist gang" accosted her cousin with both racial insults and death threats.
Bundu says other passengers in the rail car came to his defense.
She wrote the experience shook up her cousin "because if a fascist gang felt they could act in broad daylight, in public, that means that something isn\'t right, and that this climate of hatred must be stopped before it is too late."
The current mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, says police are reviewing video footage to try to identify the aggressors.

MILAN (AP) — Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte has inaugurated the twisting 44-story Generali Tower designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid.
The 190-meter (623-foot) tower, which will serve as a headquarters for the Italian insurance company Generali, was dedicated Tuesday on the first day of the annual Milan Furniture Fair that celebrates design.
The Generali Tower is one of three skyscrapers that punctuate "CityLife," a redevelopment project of the old fair grounds that incorporates parks, apartments, offices and a vast shopping area. The other towers were designed by Daniel Libeskind and Arata Isozaki.
Hadid\'s tower twists as it rises, with the upper floors facing Milan\'s centerpiece Duomo cathedral in the center of the city.
Generali chairman Gabriele Galateri called the tower "a true element of development for Milan," with a focus on sustainability.

MILAN (AP) — EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker says he is slightly concerned over Italy\'s slowing economy, and expressed hope that the government would take action to accelerate growth.
Juncker spoke Tuesday in Rome at a joint press conference with Premier Giuseppe Conte. He said that "Italian authorities must make efforts to keep growth alive in Italy."
Juncker\'s exhortations follow a report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development saying Italy\'s economy would contract 0.2 percent this year, and calling for bold reforms to tackle low productivity as well as social and regional inequalities.
The OECD report was especially critical of the basic income scheme backed by the 5-Star Movement, saying it risks weakening work incentives and creating poverty traps given the relatively high payments compared with other member states.

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — A Lithuanian man flying to Italy got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane: He was the only passenger on the Boeing 737-800.
Skirmantas Strimaitis, who was flying from capital Vilnius to the northern Italian city of Bergamo for a skiing holiday March 16, had the whole plane — which can usually sit up to 188 people — to himself. The only others onboard were two pilots and five crew members.
The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one.
Strimaitis told The Associated Press Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was "a once in the lifetime experience."


Another infant boy in Italy dies after home circumcision
ROME (AP) — The Italian news agency ANSA is reporting that another infant boy has died in Italy as the result of a circumcision performed at home.
ANSA reported the newborn died overnight near the port city of Genoa after his Nigerian mother and grandmother called for emergency medical help.
A 5-month-old baby died last month in Bologna after his parents performed a circumcision at home, and a 2-year-old boy died of severe blood loss as a result of a botched circumcision in Rome last December.
Circumcision is not practiced among Italy\'s Roman Catholic majority. Many immigrants in Italy are Muslim and practice circumcision for cultural and religious reasons, but sometimes have trouble accessing the practice in hospitals either for cost or because some doctors refuse to perform circumcisions until boys are at least 4.

Italy: Candidate says public racism a symptom of social ill
MILAN (AP) — A mayoral candidate in Italy says a cousin of hers was threatened on a public tram in Florence because of the color of his skin.
Antonella Bundu, who was born in Florence to parents from Sierra Leone, said in a Facebook post on Monday that "a fascist gang" accosted her cousin with both racial insults and death threats.
Bundu says other passengers in the rail car came to his defense.
She wrote the experience shook up her cousin "because if a fascist gang felt they could act in broad daylight, in public, that means that something isn\'t right, and that this climate of hatred must be stopped before it is too late."
The current mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, says police are reviewing video footage to try to identify the aggressors.


Often overshadowed by more scenic Italian cities, Liguria\'s capital is an under-the-radar delight, says Sarah Marshall.
Twisting a pine nut between his fingers in the same way a Hatton Garden jeweller might examine a gem, local food fanatic Mario from culinary events organisers Creattivando, is praising pesto.
“I know every one of these by name,” he jokes with theatrical gesticulations, before crushing the oily kernel with his pestle and mortar. And when the treasured ingredient costs a whopping €80 (£68) per kilo, you’d sincerely hope so.
Under the gaze of marble busts in the elegant surroundings of Genoa’s Palazzo Imperiale, I’m learning how to make the pasta sauce which was first created in the city, and is now a staple in kitchens worldwide.
But Genoa, a port city in northern Italy, deserves to be recognised for much more than a basil-based condiment.
Although it lacks the immediate beauty of other Italian big-hitters – a consequence of concrete flyovers and the demands of a working port – it does have notable treasures, often hiding behind closed doors. Take time to explore the back streets and courtyards, and it’s surprising what you’ll find…
Where to drink
Les Rouges, 1st floor of the Piazza Campetto
Staring up at faded frescoes and the chipped busts of classical philosophers, it’s hard not to feel inspired by the surroundings of this sultry, intimate salon – and that’s even before the cocktails have kicked in. Part of Palazzo Imperiale, one of Genoa’s magnificent Rolli palaces which were built in the 16th century and now have Unesco status, the bar honours its past with a signature drink inspired by the city. The Spritz Genovese (€7/£6) features locally-produced vermouth Asinello Corochinato, topped up with basil soda. Visit lesrouges.it
Where to eat
Il Marin Restaurant, Millo Building Ancient Port Calata Cattaneo
Despite Genoa’s proximity to the water, when it comes to local delicacies, seafood dishes are overshadowed by sturdier carbs like focaccia. But this sleek, dashingly modern restaurant, which overlooks the Porto Antico, serves a great selection of local catch. Crossing through the Eataly food emporium to get here, you’ll need to bypass deliciously-dressed products flirting for attention. But abstinence is definitely worth it. Sitting at long wooden tables encourages diners to share dishes, which include scallops served with turnip greens, rhubarb and hemp seeds (€19/£16), and lobster prepared with grapes and porcini mushrooms (€26/£22). A set lunch menu costs from €34 (£29). Visit genova.eataly.it.
Where to shop
Remember a time when you went to one shop for one thing? An antithesis to the likes of Amazon and Tesco, the Botteghe Storiche di Genova are a collection of historic independent stores which have been producing the same product for decades – often in ornate and beautiful surroundings. There are 39 of these living monuments from the 19th and 20th century dotted around the city, and themed walking itineraries can be found at botteghestorichegenova.it. Here are a few of the highlights:
Romeo Viganotti, Vico dei Castagna
In operation since 1866, this tiny backstreet chocolate shop also has an on-site factory where pralines and candies are produced. Some of the original machinery is still used for certain lines, and the smell of crushed hazelnuts is dizzying to the point of euphoria. At Christmas and Easter, queues can snake through the streets. Visit romeoviganotti.it.
Pissimbono, Via XXV Aprile
(Sarah Marshall/PA)
Selling what appears to be the same men’s jumper in 50 different shades, this narrow, two-floor shop is proof there’s nothing wrong with sticking to tradition. Aside from its cherished wares, the interior alone is worthy of mention. Along with an elaborate, old-fashioned cash register, there are various Singer sewing machines, including one dainty contraption built specifically for shirt cuffs. Visit pissimbono.it.
Where to sample local foods
Mercato Orientale
(iStock/PA)
A rainbow of delicate amber courgette flowers, crisp ruby-red radicchio and bushy forest-green cavolo nero leaves, the vegetables on display at this market are pert and fresh, indicating it’s probably only been a few hours since they were plucked from the ground. Other delights include homemade pesto sauces, best served with thick spirals of pasta known as trofie, and a walnut sauce designed specifically for panzotti, filled parcels similar to ravioli.
Operating in former church cloisters since the 19th century, the cherished market is soon to get a revamp, with a new street food wing due to open in May. Ivano Ricchebono, the chef at Genoa’s only Michelin-starred restaurant The Cook, plans to have a stall selling gourmet panini, and there will also be an area upstairs for cooking lessons and workshops, bookable by the public.
Where to stay
Hotel De Ville, Via Di Sottoripa
Porto Antico (Xedum/PA)
Most of Genoa’s key modern attractions are in the harbour, so this hotel’s location, set slightly back from the waterfront, is ideally suited for those eager to be in the throng of the action. Occupying several floors of a grand palace which once sheltered noble families, the hotel should be steeped in grandeur. But a minimal, simple design makes it far more understated than you might expect, and only the marble staircase hints at an opulent past. Rooms from €143 (£123) per night (two sharing), including breakfast and city tax. Visit hoteldeville.it/en.
How to get there
BA (ba.com) flies from London Gatwick to Genoa, with return flights starting from £86.72, including all taxes, charges and one hold bag.

San Francisco International Airport is once again connected to Italy with nonstop flights after newcomer Air Italy landed on Wednesday afternoon from Milan\'s Malpensa Airport (MXP).
Flights operate four times a week on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays on the carrier\'s fleet of Airbus A330-200 wide body jets.
The 5,947-mile nonstop takes off from SFO at 7:10 p.m. and arrives at the airline\'s hub in Milan at 4:05 p.m. the following day. On the return, the flight departs Milan at 1:35 p.m. and arrive SFO at 5:10 p.m. Flight times are about 12-hours each way.
For a one-week itinerary in mid-June, we found Air Italy fares in the neighborhood of $1,200 round-trip per person in the carrier\'s basic economy fare class. That\'s the fare without checked bags, advance seat selection, and lots of fees if you want to change flights. The itinerary jumps to around $1,450,00 with all those extra benefits included. That\'s a pretty good deal for a summer flight to Italy! Late August fares dip down to around $900 round trip. And in October, they are as cheap as $619 round trip.
In business class, fares range between $4,000-$5,000 round-trip-- about half of what you\'d pay on British Airways or Lufthansa for a one stop business class flight across the pond.
SFO last saw regularly scheduled non-stop flights to Italy in 2001 when Alitalia flew between San Francisco and Milan with a Boeing 767-300. In 2015, Alitalia\'s chairman, Luca di Montezemolo, laid out plans to relaunch service to SFO, but so far, we\'ve yet to see the ailing Italian flag carrier return.
Norwegian Air\'s service between Oakland and Rome\'s Fiumicino Airport is the Bay Area\'s only other non-stop flight to Italy.
Air Italy is Europe\'s newest airline after undergoing a major rebranding in 2017-2018. The carrier was formerly called Meridiana, but new owners gave it a new name, paint job, and ambitious plans to compete against Alitalia.
Its heavy use of the maroon color should look familiar — it\'s a similar hue to what is found on Qatar Airways\' jets. The uniforms worn by Air Italy\'s cabin crew have a striking resemblance to those worn by Qatar\'s too. (See the slideshow at the top of this post for a look inside the plane)
The Gulf carrier, known for its deep pockets, now owns 49 percent of Air Italy — and the company is not shy about exerting its influence or its wealth. For example, its inaugural flight celebration will be held today at the tony Ritz-Carlton, San Francisco on Nob Hill.
Check out the spaghetti-noodle-like approach the Air Italy inaugural flight took as it approached SFO yesterday-- a brilliantly clear day for a low and slow pass over the Golden Gate Bridge and the city. (Read more about these special "Bay Tour" approach flights here.)

Air Italy\'s crazy spaghetti noodle inaugural approach to SFO...
Each Air Italy A330 has 24 business class seats arranged in a 2-2-2 configuration. These seats recline into a 180-degree sleeping surface, but unlike most other carriers, they are slightly angled. Many early generation business class lie-flat seats were angled to maximize space, but most carriers have phased those products out as passengers frequently complain and sliding down the slight incline while sleeping.
In the back, there are 236 economy seats arranged 2-4-2 abreast, each with 31-inches of pitch. Air Italy does not offer a premium economy or extra-legroom economy cabin, as many other airlines flying transatlantic do. All seats come with seat back monitors with free TV and movies, and a universal power outlet. Check out Air Italy\'s A330 seat map on SeatGuru.
Satellite wifi is available for purchase with plans starting at 3 euros (roughly $3.50) for 20MBs of data. A top-tier internet plan of 21 euros (roughly $23.66) gives you 180MBs, but heavy internet browsers might burn though those amounts quickly. More here.
Air Italy is not part of an airline alliance, but you can use and earn Avios points through its Meridiana Club frequent flier program. It also codeshares with OneWorld member airlines British Airways, Iberia and (of course) Qatar Airways.

San Francisco is the latest in Air Italy\'s expansion plans. Last week, it launched four times weekly service to Los Angeles, and next month, Air Italy will begin serving Toronto. In the U.S., Air Italy also flies to New York\'s John F. Kennedy Airport and Miami. Air Italy\'s IATA code is: IG.
From its Milan hub, Air Italy flies several domestic routes providing connections to Rome, Naples, Palermo, Catania, Lamezia Terme and soon Cagliari, the capital city of the picturesque Italian island of Sardinia. The carrier also flies to several cities in the Middle East and Africa, including Accra, Cairo, Dakar, and Lagos.
The carrier has grand plans to add at least 20 addition jets in the coming years, but for the time being, it operates a rather modest fleet, with just five Airbus A330s, five Boeing 737 Next Generation jets, and three Boeing 737 MAXs. The entire MAX fleet has been grounded because of the well-publicized issues surrounding that particular plane.
Would you fly on Air Italy? What\'s your preferred way to get to Italy? Please leave your thoughts in the comments!

MILAN (AP) — EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker says he is slightly concerned over Italy\'s slowing economy, and expressed hope that the government would take action to accelerate growth.
Juncker spoke Tuesday in Rome at a joint press conference with Premier Giuseppe Conte. He said that "Italian authorities must make efforts to keep growth alive in Italy."
Juncker\'s exhortations follow a report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development saying Italy\'s economy would contract 0.2 percent this year, and calling for bold reforms to tackle low productivity as well as social and regional inequalities.
The OECD report was especially critical of the basic income scheme backed by the 5-Star Movement, saying it risks weakening work incentives and creating poverty traps given the relatively high payments compared with other member states.


Another infant boy in Italy dies after home circumcision
\r

\t\r
ROME (AP) — The Italian news agency ANSA is reporting that another infant boy has died in Italy as the result of a circumcision performed at home.
ANSA reported the newborn died overnight near the port city of Genoa after his Nigerian mother and grandmother called for emergency medical help.
A 5-month-old baby died last month in Bologna after his parents performed a circumcision at home, and a 2-year-old boy died of severe blood loss as a result of a botched circumcision in Rome last December.
Circumcision is not practiced among Italy\'s Roman Catholic majority. Many immigrants in Italy are Muslim and practice circumcision for cultural and religious reasons, but sometimes have trouble accessing the practice in hospitals either for cost or because some doctors refuse to perform circumcisions until boys are at least 4.


Italy: Candidate says public racism a symptom of social ill
MILAN (AP) — A mayoral candidate in Italy says a cousin of hers was threatened on a public tram in Florence because of the color of his skin.

\t\r
Antonella Bundu, who was born in Florence to parents from Sierra Leone, said in a Facebook post on Monday that "a fascist gang" accosted her cousin with both racial insults and death threats.
Bundu says other passengers in the rail car came to his defense.
She wrote the experience shook up her cousin "because if a fascist gang felt they could act in broad daylight, in public, that means that something isn\'t right, and that this climate of hatred must be stopped before it is too late."
The current mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, says police are reviewing video footage to try to identify the aggressors.

MILAN (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line vice premier is meeting with like-minded leaders of European right-wing party as he seeks to form a broad alliance ahead of the European elections next month.
Matteo Salvini of the the anti-migrant League says that the coalition that he is forming with Marine Le Pen, leader of France\'s far-right National Rally, "will be a great event for Europe for the next 30 years."
Salvini is meeting Monday in Milan with leaders of the Danish People\'s Party, The Finns Party and Alternative for Germany.
Peter Kofod Poulsen, the Danish People\'s Party\'s top candidate for the European Parliament elections, said in a statement that the parties are looking to form a new group of parties with common interests after the European-wide elections next month.

In route news this week, Air Italy will kick off San Francisco-Milan service in a few days; Maui gets new Southwest service from Oakland and Hawaiian flights from Sacramento; Delta upgrades LAX-Sydney aircraft; new routes to Korea launched from Minneapolis and Boston; The "big move" is on this weekend in Istanbul; Delta and Virgin Atlantic will add new routes to London next year; American begins flying its first new A321neo; Air France begins DFW flights; Ethiopian is coming to Houston and Royal Air Maroc starts Miami service; United debuts its new Polaris cabin from Newark to Hong Kong; Air Canada delays some new U.S. routes; and Colombia\'s Avianca shrinks its U.S. network.
After launching new service on April 3 between Los Angeles International and Milan Malpensa four times a week, Air Italy will do the same at San Francisco International on Tuesday (April 10) also with four weekly roundtrips. Flights will depart SFO at 7:10 p.m. on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, arriving at Malpensa the following afternoon. The carrier is using an Airbus A330-200 on the route, with 24 almost-lie-flat business class seats configured 2-2-2 and 228 economy seats in a 2-4-2 layout. Air Italy, backed by the deep pockets of Qatar Airways, also flies to New York JFK and Miami.
At Oakland, Southwest Airlines is due to kick off its second Hawaii route on April 7, introducing daily roundtrips to Kahului, Maui. The airline\'s first Hawaii route, Oakland to Honolulu, began on March 17. Next month, Southwest takes its Hawaii action to San Jose, with plans to launch SJC-Honolulu service May 5, followed by SJC-Maui on May 26. At Sacramento, meanwhile, Hawaiian Airlines this week inaugurated new daily service to Kahului. Hawaiian is using one of its new A321neos on the route with 16 first class seats, 44 Extra Comfort premium economy seats and 129 in the main cabin. (On the East Coast, meanwhile, Hawaiian on Friday started Boston-Honolulu non-stop A330 service -- the country\'s longest non-stop domestic route at 5,095 miles.)
Delta this week deployed one of its newly "refreshed" 777-200ERs on the Los Angeles-Sydney route. The overhauled aircraft offers all four of the airline\'s international seating products, including the Delta One business class, featuring 28 individual suites with privacy doors; the airline\'s new Premium Select premium economy cabin, with 48 seats; 90 extra-legroom Comfort+ seats and 112 main cabin seats (configured nine-across instead of 10), for a total passenger capacity of 296. The aircraft also has LED ambient lighting and seatback screens throughout with access to the Delta Studio lineup of free entertainment.
Elsewhere, Delta this week began new daily transpacific service from Minneapolis-St. Paul to Seoul Incheon as part of its joint venture partnership with Korean Air. That 13-hour flight also uses a refurbished 777-200ER. And to supplement Delta\'s fast-growing presence at Boston Logan, Korean Air on April 12 will start flying from there to Seoul as part of the joint venture operation. Korean will use a 787-9 Dreamliner to fly the route five days a week.
Delta also announced this week that it will offer a new U.K. option next summer as part of its joint venture partnership with Virgin Atlantic. That new option will be daily flights from both Boston and New York JFK to London\'s Gatwick Airport. Together with the two carriers\' London Heathrow flights, that will give Delta/Virgin a total of 18 daily flights from Boston and New York to London. "Full Gatwick schedule details will be announced later this year," Delta said. The carrier is also upgrading aircraft on Boston-LHR flights this week with an Airbus A330-200, which it already uses on its JFK-LHR route. And starting in November, Delta said, it will deploy refurbished 767-400s on both Heathrow routes, offering Delta One, Premium Select, Comfort+ and main cabin seating options.
This just in from Turkish Airlines: "Turkish Airlines started its great move to Istanbul Airport, the biggest airport project in the world. Following the first opening stage last October, the great move has begun as of 03:00 today. Unique in the global aviation history, the moving operation will take 45 hours in total and will conclude on Saturday, April 6 at 23:59. [The new] Istanbul Airport and [the existing] Ataturk Airport will be closed for all passenger flights during a 12-hour period between the final Turkish Airlines passenger flight departing from Ataturk Airport to Singapore on Saturday, April 6 at 02:00 and the flight from Istanbul Airport to Ankara Esenboga Airport at 14:00 the same day. Following that, the Turkish Airlines flights from Istanbul Airport will be increased in stages according to a set plan." The airline also announced that the new airport will get the old airport\'s IATA code: IST. The older Ataturk airport code will switch to ISL.
American Airlines this week started flying its first brand-new Airbus A321neo on the Phoenix-Orlando route. It has a total of 100 A321neos on order and will phase them in on the Phoenix-Anchorage route this summer and from LAX and Phoenix to Hawaii later this year, replacing 757s. The new engines on these planes will give them about 400 nautical miles of additional range compared with older A321s, American said. AA\'s new "neos" will carry 196 passengers; its current A321s have a capacity of 181 or 187, depending on the model (not counting its A321Ts, which are specially configured for prime transcontinental routes with both a first class and business class cabin; those aircraft have a capacity of just 108 passengers). The new A321s will be equipped with ViaSat Wi-Fi, streaming entertainment including live TV, and with Airbus\' XL overhead bins, which "significantly increase capacity." Its existing A321 fleet will also have those larger bins installed starting later this year, AA said.
In other route news, American this week started new service from Los Angeles International to Louisville, Kentucky, using a 128-seat A319; the eastbound segment is a red-eye, departing LAX at 10:55 p.m. And beginning October 27, American will lay on a second daily departure from Miami to London Heathrow.

Air France this week kicked off new Paris CDG-Dallas/Ft. Worth service, with plans to operate up to five flights a week through the summer season. Air France is using an A330 with 36 fully flat seats in business class, 21 in premium economy and 167 in the main cabin. And the French carrier also put a jumbo 516-seat Airbus A380 into service this week on one of its two daily Atlanta-Paris CDG flights. The other flight uses a 777.
Effective this week, United Airlines\' Newark-Hong Kong route is using a 777-300ER offering its new Polaris business class with 60 lie-flat seats as well as its Premium Plus premium economy cabin. Last year, United opened a Polaris lounge at Newark for international passengers in its new front cabin.
On June 23, Ethiopian Airlines will add Houston Bush Intercontinental as a new U.S. gateway, using a 787-8 Dreamliner to operate three flights a week to Addis Ababa. The new Houston service will operate via a stop in Lome, Togo. In other Africa route news, Royal Air Maroc this week started flying from Miami to Casablanca, using 787 Dreamliners to operate three flights a week.
In the Western Hemisphere, Air Canada is blaming the 737MAX grounding for some changes to its transborder schedule. Seasonal service from Portland to Toronto has been pushed back from May 24 to July 1 and Vancouver-Boston service has been delayed from June 1 to June 16. And Colombia\'s Avianca is making some serious cuts to its U.S. service. On May 1, Avianca will discontinue Boston-Bogota, Chicago-Bogota and New York JFK-Cartagena flights, and on June 1 it will discontinue service from Boston to San Salvador and flights from Chicago, New York JFK and Orlando to Guatemala City.

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — A Lithuanian man flying to Italy got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane: He was the only passenger on the Boeing 737-800.
Skirmantas Strimaitis, who was flying from capital Vilnius to the northern Italian city of Bergamo for a skiing holiday March 16, had the whole plane — which can usually sit up to 188 people — to himself. The only others onboard were two pilots and five crew members.
The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one.
Strimaitis told The Associated Press Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was "a once in the lifetime experience."

MILAN (AP) — Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte has inaugurated the twisting 44-story Generali Tower designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid.
The 190-meter (623-foot) tower, which will serve as a headquarters for the Italian insurance company Generali, was dedicated Tuesday on the first day of the annual Milan Furniture Fair that celebrates design.
The Generali Tower is one of three skyscrapers that punctuate "CityLife," a redevelopment project of the old fair grounds that incorporates parks, apartments, offices and a vast shopping area. The other towers were designed by Daniel Libeskind and Arata Isozaki.
Hadid\'s tower twists as it rises, with the upper floors facing Milan\'s centerpiece Duomo cathedral in the center of the city.
Generali chairman Gabriele Galateri called the tower "a true element of development for Milan," with a focus on sustainability.

MILAN (AP) — EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker says he is slightly concerned over Italy\'s slowing economy, and expressed hope that the government would take action to accelerate growth.
Juncker spoke Tuesday in Rome at a joint press conference with Premier Giuseppe Conte. He said that "Italian authorities must make efforts to keep growth alive in Italy."
Juncker\'s exhortations follow a report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development saying Italy\'s economy would contract 0.2 percent this year, and calling for bold reforms to tackle low productivity as well as social and regional inequalities.
The OECD report was especially critical of the basic income scheme backed by the 5-Star Movement, saying it risks weakening work incentives and creating poverty traps given the relatively high payments compared with other member states.

Italy: Candidate says public racism a symptom of social ill
MILAN (AP) — A mayoral candidate in Italy says a cousin of hers was threatened on a public tram in Florence because of the color of his skin.
Antonella Bundu, who was born in Florence to parents from Sierra Leone, said in a Facebook post on Monday that "a fascist gang" accosted her cousin with both racial insults and death threats.
Bundu says other passengers in the rail car came to his defense.
She wrote the experience shook up her cousin "because if a fascist gang felt they could act in broad daylight, in public, that means that something isn\'t right, and that this climate of hatred must be stopped before it is too late."
The current mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, says police are reviewing video footage to try to identify the aggressors.

Circumcision is not practiced among Italy\'s Roman Catholic majority. Many immigrants in Italy are Muslim and practice circumcision for cultural and religious reasons, but sometimes have trouble accessing the practice in hospitals either for cost or because some doctors refuse to perform circumcisions until boys are at least 4.

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — A Lithuanian man flying to Italy got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane: He was the only passenger on the Boeing 737-800.
Skirmantas Strimaitis, who was flying from capital Vilnius to the northern Italian city of Bergamo for a skiing holiday March 16, had the whole plane — which can usually sit up to 188 people — to himself. The only others onboard were two pilots and five crew members.
The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one.
Strimaitis told The Associated Press Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was "a once in the lifetime experience."

MILAN (AP) — Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte has inaugurated the twisting 44-story Generali Tower designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid.
The 190-meter (623-foot) tower, which will serve as a headquarters for the Italian insurance company Generali, was dedicated Tuesday on the first day of the annual Milan Furniture Fair that celebrates design.
The Generali Tower is one of three skyscrapers that punctuate "CityLife," a redevelopment project of the old fair grounds that incorporates parks, apartments, offices and a vast shopping area. The other towers were designed by Daniel Libeskind and Arata Isozaki.
Hadid\'s tower twists as it rises, with the upper floors facing Milan\'s centerpiece Duomo cathedral in the center of the city.
Generali chairman Gabriele Galateri called the tower "a true element of development for Milan," with a focus on sustainability.

People in this society have animal faces and have forgotten humanity.
\r

The short animated film directed by Mojtaba Mousavi won the \xe2\x80\x98Skeptyricon Special Award\xe2\x80\x99 at the 10th edition of Skepto International Film Festival in Italy.

The festival is focused on short films, and aims to encourage and give exposure to independent filmmakers from all over the world, according to its website. It also means to become a cultural reference point for the city of Cagliari and to widen its horizons to other Italian, European and Mediterranean cities.

The 10 edition of the event was held on 3-6 April 2019 in the Italian city of Cagliari.

MILAN (AP) — EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Tuesday that he is "slightly concerned" over Italy\'s slowing economy, and expressed hope that the government would take action to accelerate growth.
"Italian authorities must make supplementary efforts to keep growth alive in Italy," Juncker said at a joint press conference with Premier Giuseppe Conte.
Juncker noted that when the EU approved Italy\'s controversial budget expanding social spending, the commission projected Italian growth at 1.2 percent for 2019.
Italy has since fallen into a technical recession, and various bodies have lowered growth estimates for the year, including Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which says Italy\'s economy is likely to contract 0.2 percent this year.
In its report this week, the OECD called for bold reforms to tackle low productivity as well as social and regional inequalities.
The OECD was especially critical of the basic income scheme backed by the 5-Star Movement, saying it risks weakening work incentives and creating poverty traps given the relatively high payments compared with similar schemes in other member states.
Conte said that his government this week would approve a decree "with measures that will give impulse to growth."
But he also said that the slowdown was expected, "and that is why we conceived of a budget that wants to follow expansive but responsible policies, approving measures that the country needed for too long to re-establish social equality."

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — A Lithuanian man flying to Italy got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane: He was the only passenger on the Boeing 737-800.
Skirmantas Strimaitis, who was flying from capital Vilnius to the northern Italian city of Bergamo for a skiing holiday March 16, had the whole plane — which can usually sit up to 188 people — to himself. The only others onboard were two pilots and five crew members.
The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one.
Strimaitis told The Associated Press Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was "a once in the lifetime experience."

MILAN (AP) — Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte has inaugurated the twisting 44-story Generali Tower designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid.
The 190-meter (623-foot) tower, which will serve as a headquarters for the Italian insurance company Generali, was dedicated Tuesday on the first day of the annual Milan Furniture Fair that celebrates design.
The Generali Tower is one of three skyscrapers that punctuate "CityLife," a redevelopment project of the old fair grounds that incorporates parks, apartments, offices and a vast shopping area. The other towers were designed by Daniel Libeskind and Arata Isozaki.
Hadid\'s tower twists as it rises, with the upper floors facing Milan\'s centerpiece Duomo cathedral in the center of the city.
Generali chairman Gabriele Galateri called the tower "a true element of development for Milan," with a focus on sustainability.

MILAN (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line vice premier is meeting with like-minded leaders of European right-wing party as he seeks to form a broad alliance ahead of the European elections next month.
Matteo Salvini of the the anti-migrant League says that the coalition that he is forming with Marine Le Pen, leader of France\'s far-right National Rally, "will be a great event for Europe for the next 30 years."
Salvini is meeting Monday in Milan with leaders of the Danish People\'s Party, The Finns Party and Alternative for Germany.
Peter Kofod Poulsen, the Danish People\'s Party\'s top candidate for the European Parliament elections, said in a statement that the parties are looking to form a new group of parties with common interests after the European-wide elections next month.


Italy: Candidate says public racism a symptom of social ill
MILAN (AP) — A mayoral candidate in Italy says a cousin of hers was threatened on a public tram in Florence because of the color of his skin.
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
Antonella Bundu, who was born in Florence to parents from Sierra Leone, said in a Facebook post on Monday that "a fascist gang" accosted her cousin with both racial insults and death threats.
Bundu says other passengers in the rail car came to his defense.
She wrote the experience shook up her cousin "because if a fascist gang felt they could act in broad daylight, in public, that means that something isn\'t right, and that this climate of hatred must be stopped before it is too late."
The current mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, says police are reviewing video footage to try to identify the aggressors.


Another infant boy in Italy dies after home circumcision
\r

\t\r
ROME (AP) — The Italian news agency ANSA is reporting that another infant boy has died in Italy as the result of a circumcision performed at home.
ANSA reported the newborn died overnight near the port city of Genoa after his Nigerian mother and grandmother called for emergency medical help.
A 5-month-old baby died last month in Bologna after his parents performed a circumcision at home, and a 2-year-old boy died of severe blood loss as a result of a botched circumcision in Rome last December.
Circumcision is not practiced among Italy\'s Roman Catholic majority. Many immigrants in Italy are Muslim and practice circumcision for cultural and religious reasons, but sometimes have trouble accessing the practice in hospitals either for cost or because some doctors refuse to perform circumcisions until boys are at least 4.

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — A Lithuanian man flying to Italy got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane: He was the only passenger on the Boeing 737-800.
Skirmantas Strimaitis, who was flying from capital Vilnius to the northern Italian city of Bergamo for a skiing holiday March 16, had the whole plane — which can usually sit up to 188 people — to himself. The only others onboard were two pilots and five crew members.
The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one.
Strimaitis told The Associated Press Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was "a once in the lifetime experience."

MILAN (AP) — Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte has inaugurated the twisting 44-story Generali Tower designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid.
The 190-meter (623-foot) tower, which will serve as a headquarters for the Italian insurance company Generali, was dedicated Tuesday on the first day of the annual Milan Furniture Fair that celebrates design.
The Generali Tower is one of three skyscrapers that punctuate "CityLife," a redevelopment project of the old fair grounds that incorporates parks, apartments, offices and a vast shopping area. The other towers were designed by Daniel Libeskind and Arata Isozaki.
Hadid\'s tower twists as it rises, with the upper floors facing Milan\'s centerpiece Duomo cathedral in the center of the city.
Generali chairman Gabriele Galateri called the tower "a true element of development for Milan," with a focus on sustainability.

MILAN (AP) — Italy\'s hard-line vice premier is meeting with like-minded leaders of European right-wing party as he seeks to form a broad alliance ahead of the European elections next month.
Matteo Salvini of the the anti-migrant League says that the coalition that he is forming with Marine Le Pen, leader of France\'s far-right National Rally, "will be a great event for Europe for the next 30 years."
Salvini is meeting Monday in Milan with leaders of the Danish People\'s Party, The Finns Party and Alternative for Germany.
Peter Kofod Poulsen, the Danish People\'s Party\'s top candidate for the European Parliament elections, said in a statement that the parties are looking to form a new group of parties with common interests after the European-wide elections next month.


Another infant boy in Italy dies after home circumcision

ROME (AP) — The Italian news agency ANSA is reporting that another infant boy has died in Italy as the result of a circumcision performed at home.
ANSA reported the newborn died overnight near the port city of Genoa after his Nigerian mother and grandmother called for emergency medical help.
A 5-month-old baby died last month in Bologna after his parents performed a circumcision at home, and a 2-year-old boy died of severe blood loss as a result of a botched circumcision in Rome last December.
Circumcision is not practiced among Italy\'s Roman Catholic majority. Many immigrants in Italy are Muslim and practice circumcision for cultural and religious reasons, but sometimes have trouble accessing the practice in hospitals either for cost or because some doctors refuse to perform circumcisions until boys are at least 4.

MILAN (AP) — A mayoral candidate in Italy says a cousin of hers was threatened on a public tram in Florence because of the color of his skin.
Antonella Bundu, who was born in Florence to parents from Sierra Leone, said in a Facebook post on Monday that "a fascist gang" accosted her cousin with both racial insults and death threats.
Bundu says other passengers in the rail car came to his defense.
She wrote the experience shook up her cousin "because if a fascist gang felt they could act in broad daylight, in public, that means that something isn\'t right, and that this climate of hatred must be stopped before it is too late."
The current mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, says police are reviewing video footage to try to identify the aggressors.

The price, which confirmed what sources told Reuters on Thursday, was at the bottom of a price range that had narrowed to between 9.0 euros and 9.5 euros.
Nexi said in a statement on Friday the deal valued the company at 7.3 billion euros including debt, the equivalent of 17.2 times its core earnings. That is roughly in line with average industry valuations, according to one analyst\'s report.
It plans to float 35.6 percent of the company on the market, rising to 40.9 percent if an overallotment option is exercised.
Nexi, which runs electronic payments for credit card operator CartaSi, was taken over by private equity funds Bain Capital, Advent International and Clessidra at the end of 2015.
The fast-growing payments business faces competition from newcomers tapping technologies for alternative payment methods. In Italy, only 14 percent of purchases are cashless compared with more than half in the Netherlands, according to data from research house Ambrosetti.
The IPO will raise total proceeds of about 2 billion euros before the overallotment, including 684 million euros in fresh capital which is to be used to cut and refinance Nexi\'s debt.
The offer drew 5.4 billion euros in demand from more than 340 investors across the world, Nexi said.
Nexi shares are due to start trading in Milan on Tuesday.
BofA Merrill Lynch, Banca IMI, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Mediobanca acted as joint global coordinators and bookrunners in the deal.

Tria added that the DEF would respect public finance constraints and that while Italy\'s high debt pile was a burden for the country, it was not a risk for other states.
Asked about speculation that he could quit the coalition government, Tria said he "never thought or threatened to resign".
"My place - as long as I\'m useful - is within the government," he added.

Europe\'s No 3 insurer will hold a majority stake of ThreeSixty Investments in partnership with a team of professionals led by Giordano Lombardo, former CEO of Pioneer Investments.
The news was earlier reported by Italian financial newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore.
Last month, the insurer said it was ready to look around for growth opportunities in Europe, Asia and the United States, and added that it was well-positioned to achieve the targets it set in November for the years until 2021.

Ferrovie dello Stato, the state-owned operator of Italy\'s railways, has been in talks with Delta Air Lines over the rescue of Alitalia but last week said it needed more time to iron out a business plan for Italian flag carrier.
Alitalia was placed under special administration in 2017 after workers rejected the latest in a long line of rescue plans, and Ferrovie has been struggling to find partners ready to inject fresh funds and revamp the airline.
An end of March deadline expired as Ferrovie and its advisers were looking for investors.
"Several potential partners have pulled out ... every option is on the table," one of the sources said.
British budget airline easyJet withdrew from talks last month, with state-controlled Poste Italiane and Leonardo also stating that they are not interested in a deal.
"If the government gives Ferrovie more time it will be a widely agreed political decision to ensure that the solution found is solid and durable, with the best partners for the mission," the second source said.
The special commissioners running Alitalia are due to give their opinion on a postponement soon, but it is up to the industry ministry to take a final decision on a new deadline.
A response by the ministry could arrive in a few days, a third source said.
Last week one of the special commissioners said they could not agree on a deadline that was more than three or four weeks away, warning that the airline could be in danger of falling into liquidation.
The government has granted Alitalia a 900 million euro (769 million pounds) bridging loan that will expire at the end of June.

Moscovici\'s worries were echoed by France\'s finance minister Bruno Le Maire, who openly talked of a recession in Italy arriving at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Bucharest which will also discuss the implications for Italy\'s huge public debt caused by the emigration of skilled workers.
Moscovici said some estimates showed Italy could be in a recession this year. "These are figures that we need to follow very closely," he said.
Earlier this week the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, a club of mostly rich nations, forecast a 0.2 percent output fall in Italy this year.
Moscovici said the Commission will issue new economic forecasts on May 7. In its latest estimates released in February, the Commission predicted a 0.2 percent growth for Italy this year.
He said that the new EU forecasts will acknowledge the current economic slowdown that is most affecting Germany and Italy in the 19-country euro zone.
Italy\'s Finance Minister Giovanni Tria said Italy\'s economic woes were the result of weaker growth in Germany and in Europe, but declined to give new estimates over the country\'s growth.
In its latest forecasts, the Italian government had predicted a 1 percent expansion this year - a figure that was considered too optimistic by most economists as the Italian eurosceptic government embarked on free-spending plans with little impact on growth.
"We must be very careful about this situation, but we must not be too alarmist," Moscovici said.
France\'s Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire expressed concern over Germany\'s slowdown and Italy\'s recession, saying the euro zone\'s future was at stake if reforms were not agreed on quickly to reduce divergences among its economies.
"There is a concern for the future of the euro zone if we are not able to reduce divergences among the 19 economies of the euro zone," Le Maire told reporters, adding that a common budget for the bloc would facilitate convergence and needed to be agreed by June.
Ministers will discuss the issue at their meeting on Friday.
BRAIN DRAIN
They will also discuss a report from Brussels-based think tank CEPS that raises new concerns about Italy\'s debt in relation to the growing emigration of skilled workers from the country.
The report, seen by Reuters, says Italy was experiencing "a clear brain drain" as thousands of high-skilled workers left the country over the last decade without being replaced by immigrants with similar education levels.
If this trend continued, it could result in a fall of more than 10 percent in Italy\'s labour force, the document said.
This could worsen the sustainability of the country\'s large debt, which stands at 130 percent of output, as it would contribute to the ageing of its population and to higher pension costs, the report concluded.
Italy\'s eurosceptic government has increased the country\'s spending on pensions and opposes immigration.

Saipem, in consortium with the French company Eiffage, won a 350-million-euro contract in the Grand Tortue-Ahmeyim gas field, along the maritime border between Mauritania and Senegal. It is an EPIC (Engineering Procurement Construction and Installation) contract for marine infrastructures on the Tortue LNG hub assigned to BP as principal operator, at which they will install berthing and loading facilities for the floating unit that will produce liquefied natural gas, and a breakwater made of 21 concrete caissons (16,500 tonnes each), to protect the facility. The contract won by Saipem includes the berthing infrastructure in the floating unit and an offshore breakwater to shelter those facilities. The construction work will use subsea construction vessel Saipem 3000.


He added that there were concerns about Italy\'s growth as it could be below the 0.2 percent expansion forecast by the Commission, and much lower than the Italian government\'s predictions of 1 percent.

Questioned repeatedly about the acquisition during a U.S. Senate hearing, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday, "We\'re looking very closely at this recent decision by Qatar to take on 49 percent of this airline."
Both Republicans and Democrats at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing said they were concerned that the deal with the Italian carrier violated an agreement Qatar Airways reached with the United States in early 2018.
"There are lots of consultations taking place," Pompeo said. In January, U.S. and Qatari officials met to discuss civil aviation matters, the State Department said earlier this year.
Since 2015 the largest U.S carriers - Delta Air Lines, American Airlines Group and United Airlines - have argued their Gulf rivals are being unfairly subsidized by their governments, distorting competition.
Gulf airlines have always denied those accusations and last year the three major Middle Eastern carriers reached a voluntary agreement, saying they would not add new flights to the United States.
However, Air Italy has been flying to New York and Miami since June last year and was due to start serving San Francisco and Los Angeles from this month and Chicago in May.
Qatar Airways acquired 49 percent of Italian airline Meridiana in 2017, rebranded it Air Italy and transformed it into a carrier with five announced non-stop U.S. destinations from Milan.
Scott Reed, campaign manager for the Partnership for Open & Fair Skies, a group representing the three largest U.S. airlines and aviation unions, said "the future of this industry – and the jobs it supports – depend on the Trump administration holding Qatar accountable for its trade-cheating actions."
In December, 11 Republican senators wrote a letter to Pompeo suggesting the flights from Milan "were consistent with Qatar Airways pattern of adding subsidized capacity in markets where demand is already well served."
Reed said "there is bipartisan concern that Qatar Airways is violating last year’s agreement with the United States - making its finances more opaque instead of less and using Air Italy as a proxy to undermine the U.S. airline industry."
An aide to Senator Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the foreign relations committee, noted that January marked the one-year anniversary of agreements between the United States and Qatar on government subsidies to Qatar Airways.
In a side letter to the agreements, the Qatari government indicated there was no intention to launch additional flights from Qatar to U.S. destinations but said some passengers would board flights in Europe before flying to U.S. destinations.

The BlackRock fund has remained as the only buyer still known to be considering a bid. One of the sources said it needed more time to study a possible offer, given all the moving parts involved.
Carige was placed under special administration at the start of the year after its top investor blocked a planned capital raising, derailing an industry-financed rescue plan.
The ECB has extended by six weeks an original April 5 deadline, one source said. The first source said there was no set deadline but "a process made up of several steps which is expected to conclude in the first part of May."

Brussels had predicted in February a meagre 0.2 percent expansion in Italy this year, but Dombrovskis said that growth could turn out to be "even slower" as global and domestic factors had dampened the outlook.
A possible downward revision would further widen the gap with growth estimates made by Italy\'s eurosceptic government, which based its free-spending 2019 budget on the assumption of a 1 percent expansion.
The European Commission will publish its new economic forecasts on May 7.
"There are concerns as the economy has slowed down," Dombrovskis told a news conference in Bucharest. "We need to see what implications it has for the budget."
Speaking the day after a meeting with Italian Finance Minister Giovanni Tria on the budget, Dombrovskis said in these circumstances Italy would probably be required to freeze 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) of spending this year in order to respect EU fiscal rules.
Rome had agreed with Brussels that those 2 billion euros would be spent only if economic conditions did not deteriorate. Now this safeguard clause "should normally be activated," said Dombrovskis, who is the commissioner in charge of the euro.
The clause was negotiated to make sure Rome remained broadly compliant with EU rules that require countries with large public debts to gradually reduce them. Italy\'s debt stands above 130 percent of output, the second highest ratio in the EU after Greece, which went through three bailouts in recent years.
Dombrovskis added that Tria had assured him Italy would respect EU fiscal rules in its budgetary plans for the coming years that will be submitted to Brussels at the end of April.
Earlier this week the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, a club of mostly rich nations, forecast a 0.2 percent output fall in Italy in 2019.

Italy, whose public debt is proportionally the highest in the euro zone after Greece\'s, is struggling to hold its finances in check while keeping costly promises made by the populist ruling coalition.
The new forecasts will be presented in the annual Economic and Financial Document (DEF) due to be issued by Wednesday, which sets the framework for the 2020 budget.
The current 2020 deficit target, set in December, is 1.8 percent of GDP, down from 2.04 percent this year, but a recent economic downturn means both years will have to be revised up.
Next year\'s GDP growth will be trimmed to just below 1 percent from the current forecast of 1.1 percent, two of the sources said. They asked not to be named because they are not authorised to talk about the DEF.
The numbers in the DEF will not be finalised before the end of ongoing talks between the ruling coalition of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League.
The government will update its targets again in September, when it will have to find a way to avoid some 23 billion euros ($25.81 billion) of hikes in sales tax scheduled to take effect in 2020, but which the ruling parties have promised to scrap.
Claudio Borghi, the League\'s economics spokesman, suggested last month the government might cancel the sales tax hikes simply by increasing public borrowing, which would raise the deficit above the EU\'s 3 percent of GDP ceiling.
This is sure to be resisted by Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, an academic who is not a member of either ruling party.
Promised tax cuts, championed in particular by the League, add to Tria\'s difficulties in keeping a lid on the deficit.
The government will gradually lower income tax and simplify the system by reducing the number of tax bands from five to two, and cut the company tax rate to 20 percent, according to a draft National Reform Programme seen by Reuters, which will be published alongside the DEF.
This year\'s GDP growth forecast will be probably be cut to 0.3 percent or 0.4 percent from 1.0 percent, and the deficit will be raised to around 2.3 percent, Reuters reported on April 3, citing government sources.
The DEF will attempt to set the public debt on a declining path from last year\'s record of 132.1 percent of GDP, Tria said last week, though the economic slowdown makes the task harder.
On Tuesday statistics bureau ISTAT will issue revised debt figures for 2018 and 2017, which are expected to show an even higher debt-to-GDP ratio.

Political wrangling over the finances of heavily indebted Italy has seen the euro weaken versus the dollar.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Rome will this month likely cut its 2019 growth estimate to 0.3 percent or 0.4 percent.
The news was circulating for almost a day before the markets appeared to react to a Bloomberg report that said the government is preparing to cut its GDP forecast to 0.1 percent from 1 percent previously.
"The euro stabilized soon after the Italy news triggered an initial move lower... that suggests that the negative sentiment towards the Eurozone may be priced in and that the single currency may have carved out a near-term bottom against the U.S. dollar," said Fawad Razaqzada, a market analyst at Forex.com.
The euro was also pressured on Thursday by more signs of weakness in the German economy.
The euro has remained in a range of $1.12-$1.16 in 2019 despite a slowdown in the euro zone economy prompting new stimulus from the European Central Bank.
The euro was trading at $1.122, flat on the day. It has fallen in six of the previous eight sessions.
Investors were focused on minutes from the ECB\'s March meeting -- especially for details on the ECB\'s plans to issue new cheap loans to banks and a debate about tiering interest rates.
Hopes of a softer British exit from the European Union have weakened the appeal of defensive assets. The safe-haven yen touched a two-week low of 111.575 yen against the dollar late on Wednesday.
The lower house of the British parliament on Wednesday approved legislation that would force Prime Minister Theresa May to seek a Brexit delay to prevent a departure on April 12 without a deal.
The pound last stood at $1.3160, up 0.2 percent on the day.
Positive risk sentiment this week has helped boost the commodity-linked Australian and New Zealand dollars.

ROME -- Italy\'s populist government conceded it won\'t hit the budget-deficit target agreed on with European Union authorities, setting the stage for renewed tensions with Brussels.
Italy\'s finance ministry on Wednesday said this year\'s deficit will be 2.4% of gross domestic product, rather than 2% as agreed with the EU in December after tense negotiations that rattled financial markets.
The Italian government also cut its 2019 economic-growth forecast to 0.2%, including a boost from its latest fiscal proposals, compared with an earlier forecast of 1%.
Some private-sector economists have predicted an even worse year. Italy\'s economy has been in recession since late 2018, because of the combined effects of Europe\'s growth slowdown, global trade tensions and Italy\'s financial tensions.
Markets are sensitive to Italy\'s deficit because of the country\'s lack of growth and a government debt of around EUR2.3 trillion ($2.6 trillion), or 132% of GDP, that is the world\'s third-biggest after that of the U.S. and Japan.
The Rome government, a coalition of the antiestablishment 5 Star Movement and the nativist League, took office last summer vowing to deliver on its election promises of more-generous pensions and welfare spending and to break EU rules on fiscal discipline if necessary. The parties\' verbal attacks on the EU spooked investors, leading to capital flight from Italian government bonds.
The resulting rise in borrowing costs for Italian banks, businesses and households hurt the economy while reviving memories of the eurozone\'s 2010-12 debt crisis, from which Italy has yet to fully recover.
Although the new government de-escalated its anti-Brussels rhetoric, the compromise it reached in December with the EU executive, the European Commission, reflected both sides\' desire to avoid further confrontation, rather than a realistic assessment of Italy\'s finances.
Economic data continue to weaken, leaving Italy\'s government with an uphill task of meeting even its new deficit projection, many analysts believe.
The deficit could prove even harder to control in 2020, some economists say. Rome will need to find around EUR23 billion of savings to avoid a hefty increase in value-added tax, the equivalent of U.S. sales tax, which is scheduled to kick in unless the government finds alternative measures.
Italy has to send updated fiscal forecasts to Brussels in September, followed by a draft budget for 2020, which the Commission must approve as compliant with EU rules. European treaties require all EU countries to keep their deficit below 3% of GDP, while eurozone countries have also signed a pact to nearly eliminate so-called structural deficits, stripping out temporary and cyclical effects.
The 5 Star and League argue that welfare policies passed in December -- a lowering of the retirement age for some, and a new benefit for the poor and jobless -- will start to stimulate the economy this year. But several international organizations have said the two measures are likely to create a bigger hole in Italy\'s budget without generating much growth.

Arriving to a meeting of Euro Zone finance ministers in Bucharest, Moscovici cited non-EU figures pointing to no growth or even recession for Italy. "These are figures that we need to follow very closely," he said.
He added the Commission will issue new economic forecasts on May 7. In its latest estimates released in February, the Commission predicted a 0.2 percent growth for Italy this year.
He said that the new EU forecasts will acknowledge the current economic slowdown that is most affecting Germany and Italy in the 19-country Euro Zone.
Moscovici said that Germany\'s slowdown "may be temporary", while Italy is in recession or close to recession, depending on the institutions that make the forecasts.
"We must be very careful about this situation, but we must not be too alarmist," he said.

MILAN (AP) — Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte has inaugurated the twisting 44-story Generali Tower designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid.
The 190-meter (623-foot) tower, which will serve as a headquarters for the Italian insurance company Generali, was dedicated Tuesday on the first day of the annual Milan Furniture Fair that celebrates design.
The Generali Tower is one of three skyscrapers that punctuate "CityLife," a redevelopment project of the old fair grounds that incorporates parks, apartments, offices and a vast shopping area. The other towers were designed by Daniel Libeskind and Arata Isozaki.
Hadid\'s tower twists as it rises, with the upper floors facing Milan\'s centerpiece Duomo cathedral in the center of the city.
Generali chairman Gabriele Galateri called the tower "a true element of development for Milan," with a focus on sustainability.

MILAN (AP) — EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker says he is slightly concerned over Italy\'s slowing economy, and expressed hope that the government would take action to accelerate growth.
Juncker spoke Tuesday in Rome at a joint press conference with Premier Giuseppe Conte. He said that "Italian authorities must make efforts to keep growth alive in Italy."
Juncker\'s exhortations follow a report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development saying Italy\'s economy would contract 0.2 percent this year, and calling for bold reforms to tackle low productivity as well as social and regional inequalities.
The OECD report was especially critical of the basic income scheme backed by the 5-Star Movement, saying it risks weakening work incentives and creating poverty traps given the relatively high payments compared with other member states.


Another infant boy in Italy dies after home circumcision
\r
\t\t \r
\t \r
\r
\t\r
ROME (AP) — The Italian news agency ANSA is reporting that another infant boy has died in Italy as the result of a circumcision performed at home.
ANSA reported the newborn died overnight near the port city of Genoa after his Nigerian mother and grandmother called for emergency medical help.
A 5-month-old baby died last month in Bologna after his parents performed a circumcision at home, and a 2-year-old boy died of severe blood loss as a result of a botched circumcision in Rome last December.
Circumcision is not practiced among Italy\'s Roman Catholic majority. Many immigrants in Italy are Muslim and practice circumcision for cultural and religious reasons, but sometimes have trouble accessing the practice in hospitals either for cost or because some doctors refuse to perform circumcisions until boys are at least 4.

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — A Lithuanian man flying to Italy got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane: He was the only passenger on the Boeing 737-800.
Skirmantas Strimaitis, who was flying from capital Vilnius to the northern Italian city of Bergamo for a skiing holiday March 16, had the whole plane — which can usually sit up to 188 people — to himself. The only others onboard were two pilots and five crew members.
The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one.
Strimaitis told The Associated Press Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was "a once in the lifetime experience."


Italy: Candidate says public racism a symptom of social ill

MILAN (AP) — A mayoral candidate in Italy says a cousin of hers was threatened on a public tram in Florence because of the color of his skin.
Antonella Bundu, who was born in Florence to parents from Sierra Leone, said in a Facebook post on Monday that "a fascist gang" accosted her cousin with both racial insults and death threats.
Bundu says other passengers in the rail car came to his defense.
She wrote the experience shook up her cousin "because if a fascist gang felt they could act in broad daylight, in public, that means that something isn\'t right, and that this climate of hatred must be stopped before it is too late."
The current mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, says police are reviewing video footage to try to identify the aggressors.


\r
\tHistoric wins for Italy and Kosovo
\r
\t\t\r
\t\t\r
\r
\t\r
\t\t\r
\r
\tItaly and Kosovo both celebrated their first sets of two points in round 3 of the Men\xe2\x80\x99s EHF EURO 2020 Qualifiers, defeating Slovakia and Israel, respectively. Kosovo thereby joined Israel and Poland on two points in Group 1. Italy moved up to third place in Group 7, while Slovakia slipped to fourth.
\r
\t
\r
\tSwitzerland continued their strong form with a victory over Belgium, which took them to four points alongside Croatia in Group 2.
\r
\r
\tGROUP 1
\r
\tKosovo vs Israel 27:24 (12:8)
\r
\r
\tKosovo enjoyed a commanding win to put their first points of the qualifiers on the table. The home side, who were in control from start to finish, scored four goals before Israel hit the net for the first time. The slow start cost Israel their chance of winning the game, as they were left chasing their opponents throughout the entire match.
\r
\t
\r
\tIsrael did threaten to eliminate the deficit more than once and came within two goals inside the last 10 minutes of the half, 7:5, before Kosovo reopened a four-goal lead that they maintained until the break. Israel again closed the gap to two, 12:10, when the match resumed, but Kosovo allowed them no hope after that.
\r
\t
\r
\tBy the time the clock ticked into the last five minutes, Kosovo were comfortably in control at 24:19 and easily withstood the final efforts from their guests that narrowed the final score line.
\r
\r
\tGROUP 2
\r
\tBelgium vs Switzerland 25:28 (10:16)
\r
\r
\tIn the EHF EURO 2018 Qualifiers, Switzerland were defeated in all six matches. At the end of round 3 of the 2020 Qualifiers, they have won two games and lost one narrowly, against Croatia.
\r
\t
\r
\tSwitzerland are in a favourable position to reach their first EURO since 2006 after taking a win in the first match of the double-header against Belgium, particularly considering it was an away win.
\r
\t
\r
\tIt was a level contest early on before Switzerland began to take command. By the 25th minute, the visitors led 14:9, and they stretched that advantage to six goals by half-time.
\r
\t
\r
\tBelgium played a stronger second period and decreased the score line significantly to 21:23 near the 50-minute mark, but after that Switzerland pulled ahead to a five-goal lead and were sure of the win minutes before the buzzer.
\r
\r
\tGROUP 7
\r
\tItaly vs Slovakia 26:23 (12:9)
\r
\r
\tItaly celebrated an historic evening with their home crowd in Faenza, as they claimed their first ever win in phase 2 of the EHF EURO Qualifiers. Since the current system was introduced for the EHF EURO 2012, Italy have always bowed out in phase 1, making the victory in a phase 2 match even more momentous.
\r
\t
\r
\tThere seemed little doubt that the home side would take the win, even as early as the first quarter, when they led 6:3. After a three-goal advantage at the break, Italy cruised to a 17:12 lead in the 40th minute \xe2\x80\x93 but Slovakia proved it is never too late to fightback.
\r
\r
\t
\r
\r
\tItaly held a 25:20 lead before Slovakia scored three consecutive goals that meant the difference stood at just 25:23 with two minutes remaining. However, Italy stayed calm and had the final say, opening up a three-goal gap that earned them their first two points.

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — A Lithuanian man flying to Italy got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane: He was the only passenger on the Boeing 737-800.
Skirmantas Strimaitis, who was flying from capital Vilnius to the northern Italian city of Bergamo for a skiing holiday March 16, had the whole plane — which can usually sit up to 188 people — to himself. The only others onboard were two pilots and five crew members.
The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one.
Strimaitis told The Associated Press Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was "a once in the lifetime experience."

ROME (AP) — The Italian news agency ANSA is reporting that another infant boy has died in Italy as the result of a circumcision performed at home.
ANSA reported the newborn died overnight near the port city of Genoa after his Nigerian mother and grandmother called for emergency medical help.
A 5-month-old baby died last month in Bologna after his parents performed a circumcision at home, and a 2-year-old boy died of severe blood loss as a result of a botched circumcision in Rome last December.
Circumcision is not practiced among Italy\'s Roman Catholic majority. Many immigrants in Italy are Muslim and practice circumcision for cultural and religious reasons, but sometimes have trouble accessing the practice in hospitals either for cost or because some doctors refuse to perform circumcisions until boys are at least 4.

MILAN (AP) — EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker says he is slightly concerned over Italy\'s slowing economy, and expressed hope that the government would take action to accelerate growth.
Juncker spoke Tuesday in Rome at a joint press conference with Premier Giuseppe Conte. He said that "Italian authorities must make efforts to keep growth alive in Italy."
Juncker\'s exhortations follow a report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development saying Italy\'s economy would contract 0.2 percent this year, and calling for bold reforms to tackle low productivity as well as social and regional inequalities.
The OECD report was especially critical of the basic income scheme backed by the 5-Star Movement, saying it risks weakening work incentives and creating poverty traps given the relatively high payments compared with other member states.

Matteo Salvini of the the anti-migrant League says that the coalition that he is forming with Marine Le Pen, leader of France\'s far-right National Rally, "will be a great event for Europe for the next 30 years."
Salvini is meeting Monday in Milan with leaders of the Danish People\'s Party, The Finns Party and Alternative for Germany.
Peter Kofod Poulsen, the Danish People\'s Party\'s top candidate for the European Parliament elections, said in a statement that the parties are looking to form a new group of parties with common interests after the European-wide elections next month.

MILAN (AP) — Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte has inaugurated the twisting 44-story Generali Tower designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid.
The 190-meter (623-foot) tower, which will serve as a headquarters for the Italian insurance company Generali, was dedicated Tuesday on the first day of the annual Milan Furniture Fair that celebrates design.
The Generali Tower is one of three skyscrapers that punctuate "CityLife," a redevelopment project of the old fair grounds that incorporates parks, apartments, offices and a vast shopping area. The other towers were designed by Daniel Libeskind and Arata Isozaki.
Hadid\'s tower twists as it rises, with the upper floors facing Milan\'s centerpiece Duomo cathedral in the center of the city.
Generali chairman Gabriele Galateri called the tower "a true element of development for Milan," with a focus on sustainability.

Italy: Candidate says public racism a symptom of social ill
MILAN (AP) — A mayoral candidate in Italy says a cousin of hers was threatened on a public tram in Florence because of the color of his skin.

Antonella Bundu, who was born in Florence to parents from Sierra Leone, said in a Facebook post on Monday that "a fascist gang" accosted her cousin with both racial insults and death threats.
Bundu says other passengers in the rail car came to his defense.
She wrote the experience shook up her cousin "because if a fascist gang felt they could act in broad daylight, in public, that means that something isn\'t right, and that this climate of hatred must be stopped before it is too late."
The current mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, says police are reviewing video footage to try to identify the aggressors.
