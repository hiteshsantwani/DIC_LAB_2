BRUSSELS (AP) — The Latest on Britain\'s exit from the European Union (all times local):
11:35 a.m.
Groups representing manufacturers in the U.K. and across the continent have appealed to European leaders to work with Britain to avoid a divorce from the bloc without a deal.
Make UK and sister organization Ceemet issued a joint letter to heads of state and chief negotiator Michel Barnier warning of economic shock in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The groups say that while they recognize efforts have been made to address the chaos that a no-deal scenario would cause, "it must be clear that neither the EU nor the UK are ready, and as a consequence European industry is also not adequately prepared, for this cliff edge scenario."
Prime Minister Theresa May travels to Brussels Wednesday to ask for another extension to Britain\'s departure, until June 30. Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU on Friday.
___
9:30 a.m.
European Council President Donald Tusk is meeting leaders including British Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of an emergency summit to decide whether to grant the United Kingdom a further delay in its departure from the European Union.
Donald Tusk meets the leaders of Lithuania, Latvia, The Netherlands and finally May shortly before Wednesday evening\'s summit begins.
It\'s likely to be a rough day for the embattled British leader as she pleads for a second extension until June 30, to prevent Britain\'s departure now scheduled for Friday.
Tusk has suggested an even longer delay of up to a year with conditions attached to ensure Britain does not stymie EU decision making if it remains a member.
EU countries have become increasingly exasperated with the political division and uncertainty in Britain.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on Brexit (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
European Council President Donald Tusk has urged European Union member states to offer the U.K. a flexible extension of up to a year to make sure the nation doesn\'t crash out of the bloc in a chaotic and costly way.
Two EU officials, who requested anonymity because they weren\'t authorized to disclose information before it was made public, said that Tusk wants a one-year "Flextention" and get it approved at next Wednesday\'s EU summit.
Such a move would mean that the U.K. needs to take part in the May 23-26 European elections, something which British Prime Minister Theresa May has long argued against.
May asked Tusk for a short extension until June 30 earlier Friday. Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU on April 12.

An anti-fascist protest in Rome last Saturday (Pic: Andrea Guerrizio) \r

\t\t\t\t
\t\t\t\t\r
\r
Racist protests started in the Italian capital of Rome on Tuesday of last week after the council announced a bus would transfer 70 Roma to a reception centre in Torre Maura, an eastern suburb of the city.
\r
\r
Nearly half of the Roma people were children.
\r
\r
About 300 protesters gathered within a few hours in front of the entrance to the building, setting fire to cars and bins.
\r
\r
Fascist groups were at the heart of the protests.
\r
\r
The protesters were shown trampling on food destined for the Roma, and could be heard shouting, “They must die of hunger.”
\r
\r
“Fucking apes should be burned alive,” was written on the wall of the building and the car of a worker at the centre burnt out.
\r
\r
On Wednesday, Rome’s city council, which is controlled by the populist Five Star Movement (M5S), capitulated and announced it had decided to relocate the Roma in another area. The fascists of CasaPound described the decision as a great victory. The fascist Forza Nuova party announced “a permanent garrison until the last Roma has left”.
\r
\r
Expel
\r
\r
In July last year, the far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, vowed to “turn words into action” in his drive to expel thousands of Roma from Italy.
\r
\r
The number of racially motivated attacks has risen sharply, tripling between 2017 and 2018, when the racist League party entered government in coalition with M5S.
\r
\r
Marcello Zuinisi, of the National Association of the Roma said, “The racist, fascist and Nazi squads organised in the CasaPound and Forza Nuova parties are allowed to act with impunity amid the crimes committed by government leaders.
\r
\r
“Italy is on the brink of a new abyss—that of the ‘racial laws’. At a distance of 81 years from the beginning of the Holocaust the essence of humanity is still at stake.
\r
\r
“It is necessary to defend the life of the Roma, Sinti and Caminanti threatened by barbarians and to release Italy from racism, fascism and Nazism.”
\r
\r
There has been some opposition. “I’m not okay with it! No!” has become popularised as a slogan after 15 year old Simone was filmed standing up to the fascists. It was the slogan of an anti-fascist demo held last Saturday in Torre Maura. It was backed by a number of NGOs and the CGIL union.
\r
\r
The protest saw a number of local residents voice their opposition to the fascists.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on Brexit (all times local):

Prime Minister Theresa May says Britain will make contingency plans to take part in European Parliament elections in May if no Brexit deal is reached in the interim.
She said in her letter Friday to the EU that she is making these preparations even though she believes it\'s not in Britain\'s interest or the European Union\'s interest for Britain to take part in the elections because it is a departing member state.
May says she "accepts" the EU position that if Britain hasn\'t left the 28-nation bloc by May 23, it will have a legal obligation to take part in the elections.
The prime minister says she is still hopeful of reaching a compromise agreement that could take Britain out of the EU before that time.
___
9:20 a.m.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is requesting that the deadline for her country to leave the European Union be extended until June 30.
In a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk Friday, May said that "the United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June, 2019."
EU leaders agreed late last month to prolong the Brexit date from March 29 until April 12, unless May could push their mutually agreed divorce deal through Parliament.
The Europeans would prefer that Britain don\'t take part in the May 23-26 EU elections if it is going to leave. April 12 is the last day for Britain to signal whether it will field candidates.


LONDON,
Britain has begun issuing passports with the words "European Union" removed from the front cover -- despite Brexit being delayed and uncertainty over when the country will leave the bloc.
The interior ministry confirmed that some passports introduced from March 30, the day after Britain was originally due to depart, no longer include references to the EU following a 2017 decision.
However, it said some newly-issued travel documents would still bear the bloc\'s name -- which has sat atop British passport covers -- in a bid to save public money.
"In order to use leftover stock and achieve best value for the taxpayer, passports that include the words \'European Union\' will continue to be issued for a short period," a spokeswoman said.
"There will be no difference for British citizens whether they are using a passport that includes the words European Union, or a passport that does not," she added, noting both designs would be "equally valid for travel".
DELAYED EXIT
Britain was set to leave the EU on March 29 but has been forced to delay its exit amid political paralysis in Westminster over the terms of the divorce deal.
Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday was forced to ask the bloc for another extension, until June 30, to prevent the country crashing out next Friday without an accord.
But it is unclear whether the other 27 EU members, which must give unanimous backing, will grant the request or insist on an even longer delay.
BREXIT DIVISIONS
British passports have become ensnared in the country\'s Brexit divisions after the government announced in 2017 it would return to traditional blue passports "to restore national identity".
The travel documents had dark blue covers from 1921, but Britain switched to burgundy from 1988, in common with other passports in what was then the European Community.
Brexit backers are thrilled by the highly symbolic change, while those who support remaining in the bloc have mocked their excitement.
Last year it emerged that Franco-Dutch company Gemalto had won the contract to make the new blue passports, prompting fury from Brexit campaigners and more ridicule from Remainers that a British company was not chosen.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on Brexit (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
European Council President Donald Tusk has urged European Union member states to offer the U.K. a flexible extension of up to a year to make sure the nation doesn\'t crash out of the bloc in a chaotic and costly way.
Two EU officials, who requested anonymity because they weren\'t authorized to disclose information before it was made public, said that Tusk wants a one-year "Flextention" and get it approved at next Wednesday\'s EU summit.
Such a move would mean that the U.K. needs to take part in the May 23-26 European elections, something which British Prime Minister Theresa May has long argued against.
May asked Tusk for a short extension until June 30 earlier Friday. Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU on April 12.
--By Raf Casert in Brussels
___
9:25 a.m.
Prime Minister Theresa May says Britain will make contingency plans to take part in European Parliament elections in May if no Brexit deal is reached in the interim.
She said in her letter Friday to the EU that she is making these preparations even though she believes it\'s not in Britain\'s interest or the European Union\'s interest for Britain to take part in the elections because it is a departing member state.
May says she "accepts" the EU position that if Britain hasn\'t left the 28-nation bloc by May 23, it will have a legal obligation to take part in the elections.
The prime minister says she is still hopeful of reaching a compromise agreement that could take Britain out of the EU before that time.
___
9:20 a.m.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is requesting that the deadline for her country to leave the European Union be extended until June 30.
In a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk Friday, May said that "the United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June, 2019."
EU leaders agreed late last month to prolong the Brexit date from March 29 until April 12, unless May could push their mutually agreed divorce deal through Parliament.
The Europeans would prefer that Britain don\'t take part in the May 23-26 EU elections if it is going to leave. April 12 is the last day for Britain to signal whether it will field candidates.

BRUSSELS (AP) — The Latest on Britain\'s exit from the European Union (all times local):
12:45 p.m.
The European Union\'s legislature has warned British Prime Minister Theresa May to come to the Brexit summit with clear indications on how she hopes to turn the cross-party talks with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn into a success.
The European Parliament said in a statement Wednesday that May "cannot come empty-handed."
And the legislators told the EU leaders that they have to make sure that Britain will not become obstructionist if a long extension to their departure is granted.
They said the summit "would be advised to provide the U.K. with an extension which should be appropriately framed to respect the principle of sincere cooperation."
The European Parliament will need to approve any deal May reaches with the EU to make it binding.
___
11:35 a.m.
Groups representing manufacturers in the U.K. and across the continent have appealed to European leaders to work with Britain to avoid a divorce from the bloc without a deal.
Make UK and sister organization Ceemet issued a joint letter to heads of state and chief negotiator Michel Barnier warning of economic shock in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The groups say that while they recognize efforts have been made to address the chaos that a no-deal scenario would cause, "it must be clear that neither the EU nor the UK are ready, and as a consequence European industry is also not adequately prepared, for this cliff edge scenario."
Prime Minister Theresa May travels to Brussels Wednesday to ask for another extension to Britain\'s departure, until June 30. Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU on Friday.

European Council President Donald Tusk is meeting leaders including British Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of an emergency summit to decide whether to grant the United Kingdom a further delay in its departure from the European Union.
Donald Tusk meets the leaders of Lithuania, Latvia, The Netherlands and finally May shortly before Wednesday evening\'s summit begins.
It\'s likely to be a rough day for the embattled British leader as she pleads for a second extension until June 30, to prevent Britain\'s departure now scheduled for Friday.
Tusk has suggested an even longer delay of up to a year with conditions attached to ensure Britain does not stymie EU decision making if it remains a member.
EU countries have become increasingly exasperated with the political division and uncertainty in Britain.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on Brexit (all times local):
9:25 a.m.
Prime Minister Theresa May says Britain will make contingency plans to take part in European Parliament elections in May if no Brexit deal is reached in the interim.
She said in her letter Friday to the EU that she is making these preparations even though she believes it\'s not in Britain\'s interest or the European Union\'s interest for Britain to take part in the elections because it is a departing member state.
May says she "accepts" the EU position that if Britain hasn\'t left the 28-nation bloc by May 23, it will have a legal obligation to take part in the elections.
The prime minister says she is still hopeful of reaching a compromise agreement that could take Britain out of the EU before that time.

British Prime Minister Theresa May is requesting that the deadline for her country to leave the European Union be extended until June 30.
In a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk Friday, May said that "the United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June, 2019."
EU leaders agreed late last month to prolong the Brexit date from March 29 until April 12, unless May could push their mutually agreed divorce deal through Parliament.
The Europeans would prefer that Britain don\'t take part in the May 23-26 EU elections if it is going to leave. April 12 is the last day for Britain to signal whether it will field candidates.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on Brexit (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
European Council President Donald Tusk has urged European Union member states to offer the U.K. a flexible extension of up to a year to make sure the nation doesn\'t crash out of the bloc in a chaotic and costly way.
Two EU officials, who asked not to be identified because the offer had not been made official, said that Tusk wants a one-year "Flextention" and get it approved at next Wednesday\'s EU summit.
Such a move would mean that the U.K. needs to take part in the May 23-26 European elections, something which British Prime Minister Theresa May has long argued against.
May asked Tusk for a short extension until June 30 earlier Friday. Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU on April 12.

BRUSSELS (AP) — The Latest on Britain\'s exit from the European Union (all times local):
12:45 p.m.
The European Union\'s legislature has warned British Prime Minister Theresa May to come to the Brexit summit with clear indications on how she hopes to turn the cross-party talks with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn into a success.
The European Parliament said in a statement Wednesday that May "cannot come empty-handed."
And the legislators told the EU leaders that they have to make sure that Britain will not become obstructionist if a long extension to their departure is granted.
They said the summit "would be advised to provide the U.K. with an extension which should be appropriately framed to respect the principle of sincere cooperation."
The European Parliament will need to approve any deal May reaches with the EU to make it binding.

Prime Minister Theresa May says Britain will make contingency plans to take part in European Parliament elections in May if no Brexit deal is reached in the interim.
She said in her letter Friday to the EU that she is making these preparations even though she believes it\'s not in Britain\'s interest or the European Union\'s interest for Britain to take part in the elections because it is a departing member state.
May says she "accepts" the EU position that if Britain hasn\'t left the 28-nation bloc by May 23, it will have a legal obligation to take part in the elections.
The prime minister says she is still hopeful of reaching a compromise agreement that could take Britain out of the EU before that time.

British Prime Minister Theresa May is requesting that the deadline for her country to leave the European Union be extended until June 30.
In a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk Friday, May said that "the United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June, 2019."
EU leaders agreed late last month to prolong the Brexit date from March 29 until April 12, unless May could push their mutually agreed divorce deal through Parliament.
The Europeans would prefer that Britain don\'t take part in the May 23-26 EU elections if it is going to leave. April 12 is the last day for Britain to signal whether it will field candidates.

BRUSSELS (AP) — The Latest on Britain\'s exit from the European Union (all times local):
12:45 p.m.
The European Union\'s legislature has warned British Prime Minister Theresa May to come to the Brexit summit with clear indications on how she hopes to turn the cross-party talks with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn into a success.
The European Parliament said in a statement Wednesday that May "cannot come empty-handed."
And the legislators told the EU leaders that they have to make sure that Britain will not become obstructionist if a long extension to their departure is granted.
They said the summit "would be advised to provide the U.K. with an extension which should be appropriately framed to respect the principle of sincere cooperation."
The European Parliament will need to approve any deal May reaches with the EU to make it binding.

Groups representing manufacturers in the U.K. and across the continent have appealed to European leaders to work with Britain to avoid a divorce from the bloc without a deal.
Make UK and sister organization Ceemet issued a joint letter to heads of state and chief negotiator Michel Barnier warning of economic shock in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The groups say that while they recognize efforts have been made to address the chaos that a no-deal scenario would cause, "it must be clear that neither the EU nor the UK are ready, and as a consequence European industry is also not adequately prepared, for this cliff edge scenario."

Donald Tusk meets the leaders of Lithuania, Latvia, The Netherlands and finally May shortly before Wednesday evening\'s summit begins.
It\'s likely to be a rough day for the embattled British leader as she pleads for a second extension until June 30, to prevent Britain\'s departure now scheduled for Friday.
Tusk has suggested an even longer delay of up to a year with conditions attached to ensure Britain does not stymie EU decision making if it remains a member.
EU countries have become increasingly exasperated with the political division and uncertainty in Britain.

9:30 a.m.
European Council President Donald Tusk is meeting leaders including British Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of an emergency summit to decide whether to grant the United Kingdom a further delay in its departure from the European Union.
Donald Tusk meets the leaders of Lithuania, Latvia, The Netherlands and finally May shortly before Wednesday evening\'s summit begins.
It\'s likely to be a rough day for the embattled British leader as she pleads for a second extension until June 30, to prevent Britain\'s departure now scheduled for Friday.
Tusk has suggested an even longer delay of up to a year with conditions attached to ensure Britain does not stymie EU decision making if it remains a member.
EU countries have become increasingly exasperated with the political division and uncertainty in Britain.


British politicians have rejected Theresa May\'s divorce deal with the European Union for a third time leaving Brexit in uncertainty.
British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday sought to delay Brexit until June 30 to avoid a chaotic withdrawal from the European Union in one week, but a key leader of the bloc suggested an even longer pause in the difficult divorce proceedings.
The question over timing is vital because Britain is set to leave the EU without a withdrawal deal in place on April 12 unless an agreement is reached at a Brussels summit set to take place two days earlier.
In a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk, Mrs May asked for an extension until June 30 and agreed to make contingency plans to take part in European parliament elections on May 23-26 if necessary.
Mr Tusk proposed a longer time frame. He urged the 27 remaining EU nations to offer the UK a flexible extension of up to a year to make sure the nation doesn’t leave the bloc in a chaotic way that could undermine commerce.
Two EU officials said Mr Tusk wants a one-year period, which has been dubbed a “flextension,” and hopes to get it approved at the EU summit on April 10. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorised to disclose information before it was made public.
Such a move would mean that the UK would need to take part in the elections to the European parliament, something the UK prime minister has long argued would not be in either side’s interest.
The elections pose a substantial stumbling block because Britain would be expected to take part, if it is still an EU member, so its people have representation in the European parliament. Officials worry that the legitimacy of European institutions could be jeopardised if the population of a member state is not involved in the process.
Any extension to the deadline will need unanimous approval from the rest of the EU. French President Emmanuel Macron has thus far seemed cautious about giving Britain more time, saying the bloc cannot be held hostage by Britain’s political deadlock over Brexit.
There are also concerns in Europe that some British politicians who want to provoke a “no-deal” Brexit might try to make trouble from inside the bloc, a course that outspoken Brexit advocate Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested Friday.
He tweeted that “if a long extension leaves us stuck in the EU, we should be as difficult as possible.” The Conservative Party politician suggested using Britain’s position to veto any EU budget increases, block the establishment of an EU army, and make it impossible for Macron to push further EU integration.
Brexit backer Nigel Farage, who has long ridiculed Europe’s institutions, also said he would campaign in European parliament elections.
If any EU nation refuses to back an extension, Britain will be expected to leave as scheduled on April 12.
There are concerns that such an abrupt exit without a deal could lead to economic slowdown and a breakdown in food and medical supplies as border checks and tariffs are added overnight. Massive traffic jams could also be expected on highways leading to major ferry ports.
An earlier British request for a delay until June 30 was rejected, and officials are disappointed May has again sought an extension until that date, said Larissa Brunner, an analyst with European Policy Center.
“The EU has already said ‘no’ once, so I think Theresa May knows that EU is probably not going to grant her that extension,” she said.
She said Mrs May could be able to blame the EU for rejecting an extension if Britain leaves the bloc next week without an agreement.
The complex manoeuvring comes as Britain’s parliament considers legislation designed to prevent such a “no-deal” departure.
Britain’s upper House of Lords is set to resume debate on the measure on Monday. It was endorsed earlier by the lower House of Commons by just one vote.
Despite the apparent support in parliament for a new law to prevent a no-deal exit, the decision is in the hands of the EU, not Britain.
It is the first country to try to leave the bloc, and the formal “Article 50” exit procedure has never been tested before.
The Europeans would prefer that Britain not take part in the European parliament elections if it is going to leave. April 12 is the last day for Britain to signal whether it will field candidates.
Mrs May said in her letter that Britain is reluctantly ready to begin preparations for the European elections if no Brexit deal is reached in the interim.
She said she is making the preparations even though she believes it is not in the interest of either Britain or the EU for her country to participate because it is leaving the bloc.
Mrs May said she “accepts” the EU position that if Britain has not left by May 23, it will have a legal obligation to take part in the voting.
She said she hopes to reach a compromise agreement that could take Britain out of the EU before that.
Mrs May’s withdrawal plan, reached with the EU over more than two years of negotiations, has been rejected by the UK parliament three times. She is now seeking a compromise in a series of talks with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and his deputies, with hopes of winning opposition support for a new divorce deal.
If that doesn’t work, May plans a series of votes in parliament to see if a majority-backed plan can emerge.
Ideas being discussed include keeping Britain in a customs union with the EU after it leaves the bloc, as well as the possibility of a second referendum. There is fierce opposition from Brexit backers in the Conservative Party to these options.


UK MPs will again attempt to find a new alternative to Prime Minister Theresa May\'s Brexit plan.
The House of Commons will hold a second round of \'indicative votes\' to see if any option is backed by a majority.
The British Labour Party has backed continued free movement of people after Brexit, the party has confirmed.
Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has ordered his MPs to back plans to keep Britain in the single market when the Commons votes on the way ahead for Brexit on Monday night (local time).
According to The Sun, the move sparked a backlash within Labour as furious MPs accused the party of breaking its promises to voters.
The House of Commons will hold a second round of “indicative votes” from 8pm (6am AEDT) after Theresa May’s deal was defeated for the third time last week.
They will cast votes on four different options — the customs union, single market, a second referendum and cancelling Brexit altogether.
During the first set of indicative votes last week, MPs failed to find a majority for any of the outcomes they voted on.
But backers of the customs union and “Common Market 2.0” plans are confident they can win support this evening.
And this afternoon Labour confirmed their MPs will be voting for Common Market 2.0 — even though that means accepting continued free movement of people.

MORE: May mulls fourth try on Brexit deal
MORE: Brexit chaos as MPs reject plans
Tory MP Nick Boles, the brains behind the plan, said his motion “now has a real chance of winning the majority that has eluded the PM”.
But Brexiteer Charlie Elphicke blasted: “We need to be clear this means Labour are voting for uncontrolled EU immigration to continue.”
And Labour veteran Kevin Barron vowed to rebel, pointing out the party’s manifesto “clearly states that we will end freedom of movement when we leave the EU”.
Mrs May is hoping to make MPs choose between a soft Brexit and her deal later this week, in a last-ditch bid to save her plan.
FOUR ALTERNATIVES
British politicians are considering four alternatives to Mrs May’s rejected Brexit deal, in hopes of finding a plan that can command majority support.
The options up for votes Monday night (local time) in parliament include two proposals that aim to retain close economic ties between Britain and the European Union.
One would keep the UK in a customs union for goods with the EU after Brexit, while another calls for Britain to stay in the bloc’s single market for both goods and services.
Another option wants any Brexit deal to be submitted to a public referendum, and the fourth says Britain should cancel its departure from the EU if it comes within two days of crashing out of the bloc without an agreement. House of Commons Speaker John Bercow chose the options from eight ideas submitted.
It comes as a leading credit ratings agency has reiterated the array of economic difficulties it foresees Britain encountering if the country crashes out of the European Union without an exit deal.
Standard & Poor’s said in an update that a disorderly Brexit would “adversely affect income levels and growth prospects, as well as government finances.”
S&P also is warning that Britain’s withdrawal could “significantly limit” access to key European markets. The ratings agency says if that happens, it would expect “downward pressure” on house prices, a significant increase in the country’s debt and a further drop in the value of the pound. S&P has said such a scenario could lead it to downgrade Britain’s AA long-term credit rating.
— with The Sun


Brexit has descended into chaos as Theresa May offered to resign to achieve her deal but this along with eight other amendments were rejected.
The British government is optimistic about reaching some form of deal with the opposition Labour Party to end a deadlock on Brexit, Britain\xe2\x80\x99s finance minister Philip Hammond says.
But Labour says the governing Conservatives needed to be more flexible and have not shown any movement on a political declaration of intent on the future relationship between London and Brussels once Britain has left the EU.
No talks have been arranged yet between the two sides for this weekend, a Labour source told Reuters.
Prime Minister Theresa May has asked EU leaders to postpone Britain’s exit from the bloc next Friday until June 30 but the EU insists she must first show a viable plan to secure agreement on her thrice-rejected divorce deal in the British parliament.
It is the latest twist in a saga which leaves Britain, the world’s fifth-biggest economy, struggling to find a way to honour a 2016 referendum vote to take the country out of the globe’s largest trading bloc.
Mr Hammond, however, told reporters overnight he was upbeat about breaking the impasse.
“I am optimistic that we will reach some form of agreement with Labour,” he said on the sidelines of a meeting of EU finance ministers in Bucharest.
Mr Hammond added he expected the exchange of “some more texts” on Saturday. But Labour’s home affairs spokeswoman said the Conservatives needed to show a willingness to compromise on Prime Minister Theresa May’s red lines, which include no more membership of the EU’s customs union or single market.
“My understanding is that there has been no movement from the government on the actual concept of the political declaration and that is key,” Diane Abbott told BBC radio on Saturday.
“The government perhaps has to show a little more flexibility than it seems to have done so far.” Mr Hammond, who is one of the most pro-European members of May’s government, also signalled optimism about next Wednesday’s EU summit on Brexit.
He said most EU states agreed there was a need to delay Brexit.
“Most of the colleagues that I am talking to accept we will need longer to complete this process,” he said.
Britons voted in 2016 by a 52 to 48 per cent margin for Brexit and the two main parties, parliament, and the nation at large remain profoundly split over the terms for departure as well as over whether to leave at all.
Many within the Conservative Party are increasingly worried that any delay obliging Britain to again take part in elections for the European parliament on May 23-26 would be deeply divisive.
“Going to the EU elections for the Conservative Party, or indeed for the Labour Party, and telling our constituents why we haven’t been able to deliver Brexit I think would be an existential threat,” junior education minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC on Saturday.
“I would go further and say … it would be the suicide note of the Conservative Party.”

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on Brexit (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
European Council President Donald Tusk has urged European Union member states to offer the U.K. a flexible extension of up to a year to make sure the nation doesn\'t crash out of the bloc in a chaotic and costly way.
Two EU officials, who asked not to be identified because the offer had not been made official, said that Tusk wants a one-year "Flextention" and get it approved at next Wednesday\'s EU summit.
Such a move would mean that the U.K. needs to take part in the May 23-26 European elections, something which British Prime Minister Theresa May has long argued against.

She said in her letter Friday to the EU that she is making these preparations even though she believes it\'s not in Britain\'s interest or the European Union\'s interest for Britain to take part in the elections because it is a departing member state.
May says she "accepts" the EU position that if Britain hasn\'t left the 28-nation bloc by May 23, it will have a legal obligation to take part in the elections.
The prime minister says she is still hopeful of reaching a compromise agreement that could take Britain out of the EU before that time.

British Prime Minister Theresa May is requesting that the deadline for her country to leave the European Union be extended until June 30.
In a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk Friday, May said that "the United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June, 2019."
EU leaders agreed late last month to prolong the Brexit date from March 29 until April 12, unless May could push their mutually agreed divorce deal through Parliament.
The Europeans would prefer that Britain don\'t take part in the May 23-26 EU elections if it is going to leave. April 12 is the last day for Britain to signal whether it will field candidates.

BRUSSELS (AP) — The Latest on Britain\'s exit from the European Union (all times local):
12:45 p.m.
The European Union\'s legislature has warned British Prime Minister Theresa May to come to the Brexit summit with clear indications on how she hopes to turn the cross-party talks with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn into a success.
The European Parliament said in a statement Wednesday that May "cannot come empty-handed."
And the legislators told the EU leaders that they have to make sure that Britain will not become obstructionist if a long extension to their departure is granted.
They said the summit "would be advised to provide the U.K. with an extension which should be appropriately framed to respect the principle of sincere cooperation."
The European Parliament will need to approve any deal May reaches with the EU to make it binding.

11:35 a.m.
Groups representing manufacturers in the U.K. and across the continent have appealed to European leaders to work with Britain to avoid a divorce from the bloc without a deal.
Make UK and sister organization Ceemet issued a joint letter to heads of state and chief negotiator Michel Barnier warning of economic shock in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The groups say that while they recognize efforts have been made to address the chaos that a no-deal scenario would cause, "it must be clear that neither the EU nor the UK are ready, and as a consequence European industry is also not adequately prepared, for this cliff edge scenario."
Prime Minister Theresa May travels to Brussels Wednesday to ask for another extension to Britain\'s departure, until June 30. Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU on Friday.

9:30 a.m.
European Council President Donald Tusk is meeting leaders including British Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of an emergency summit to decide whether to grant the United Kingdom a further delay in its departure from the European Union.
Donald Tusk meets the leaders of Lithuania, Latvia, The Netherlands and finally May shortly before Wednesday evening\'s summit begins.
It\'s likely to be a rough day for the embattled British leader as she pleads for a second extension until June 30, to prevent Britain\'s departure now scheduled for Friday.
Tusk has suggested an even longer delay of up to a year with conditions attached to ensure Britain does not stymie EU decision making if it remains a member.
EU countries have become increasingly exasperated with the political division and uncertainty in Britain.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on Brexit (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
European Council President Donald Tusk has urged European Union member states to offer the U.K. a flexible extension of up to a year to make sure the nation doesn\'t crash out of the bloc in a chaotic and costly way.
Two EU officials, who requested anonymity because they weren\'t authorized to disclose information before it was made public, said that Tusk wants a one-year "Flextention" and get it approved at next Wednesday\'s EU summit.
Such a move would mean that the U.K. needs to take part in the May 23-26 European elections, something which British Prime Minister Theresa May has long argued against.
May asked Tusk for a short extension until June 30 earlier Friday. Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU on April 12.

LIVERPOOL supporter Sean Cox has spoken on camera for the first time since a horror attack left him for dead outside Anfield.
FIGHTING BACK: Sean Cox has spoken on camera for the first time to say \'thank you\' (Pic: FACEBOOK/GETTY)
The big Reds fan have thanked the public for their support in a touching video – a year after he was savagely attacked before a Liverpool game. He is heard in the clip saying "thank you" and holding his thumbs up as he continues to recover after the assault in 2018 left him in a coma. The Irishman\'s words come ahead of a charity match being held by his boyhood club in Dublin tomorrow between Liverpool FC Legends and a Republic of Ireland XI. Sean, 53, suffered life-changing injuries when he was targeted by opposition "ultras" ahead of a Champions League semi-final clash against Roma last April 24.

His wife, Martina, recently revealed how the dad-of-three from Dunboyne had been dealt a “life sentence” during the “17 seconds of madness” unprovoked attack last April 24. Cox is under the care of top experts at a rehabilitation hospital in Ireland where he receives round the clock treatment, and is now having to learn how to speak and move again. But his friend recently revealed how Sean will take the huge milestone of leaving hospital for the first time to attend tomorrow\'s "Legends for Sean Cox" match at Dublin\'s Aviva Stadium. The tribute game will see Sean\'s Liverpool heroes managed by Kenny Dalglish and captained by Ian Rush, who will go head to head with Republic of Ireland legends led by Mick McCarthy.

All proceeds raised from the match tomorrow night will be donated to the Sean Cox Rehabilitation Trust. Sean\'s friend Stephen Felle said: “We’re delighted to say that Sean is going to be there in person. “It’s going to be Sean’s first move outside a medical environment in almost 12 months, so it’s very special for the family and it’s very emotional for Martina. “She says he does (know he’s going)…and he’s excited…he keeps smiling, he can’t wait.”
HEARTBREAKING: These were the scenes outside Anfield when the attack took place (Pic: TWITTER)
BIG SUPPORT: Liverpool FC have gotten behind Sean and his family ever since the attack (Pic: GETTY)
The pal added that Sean has shown signs of progress but is on a “very slow and long journey”. “(When) we talk about progress, or we talk about Seán’s recovery… I think people need to understand the degrees of magnitude are very, very small," he said. “It is heartening that Seán can say more words, or that he may be more alert, or that his movement might be improving. “In terms of being able to watch matches or being able to tune in on a daily basis to what the league rankings are… it would be a stretch to think Seán can do that.

Italy news: The Italian government has slashed its growth forecast for this year
The Italian government has slashed its growth forecast for this year, highlighting the economic woes facing the debt-ridden nation, as Rome braced for a slowdown in growth to dent public finances. Italy is expecting 0.2 percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth for this year, down for a previous projection made in December of 1.0 percent. Announcing the downgrade yesterday, the Treasury also announced ramped up the 2019 budget deficit target to 2.4 percent of GDP, up from a 2.04 percent goal fixed in December following a bitter spat with the European Commission. The new deficit target is likely to enrage EU finance chiefs, with it being the same rejected by the Commission last autumn as being too high and breaking EU rules.
Vincenzo Longo, analyst at IG Markets, said: ”The deficit is the most thorny issue for Italy and could spark tensions with the European Union.” The Italian Treasury later said the “structural deficit”, adjusted for GDP growth fluctuations, would be 1.5 percent of GDP this year and in line with commitments made to Brussels. Italy spent much of the latter half of last year wrangling with the EU over its budget, with Rome being threatened with disciplinary action unless it takes action against its debt. The monetary agreement was finally passed at the end of December, after Italy agreeing to lower its deficit target for this year.

It comes after Italy fell into recession after a second consecutive quarter of decline was recorded for the last three months of 2018. The economy contracted by 0.2 percent in October to December of last year, after a decrease of 0.1 percent in July to September. Earlier this week the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast a 0.2 percent output fall in Italy this year. David Lipton, deputy director general of the International Monetary Fund, warned last week how Italy could record a new contraction for the first quarter of 2019, deepening the woes of the economy. Speaking in Lisbon, Portugal, Mr Lipton highlighted Italy as he spoke of the “glaring vulnerabilities" of some nations in the European Union which leave the bloc unprepared for future economic risks.

Donald Trump is slapping huge tariffs on the EU
A European Commission source said on Tuesday the level of proposed US countermeasures was "greatly exaggerated", adding the amount of retaliation could only be determined by a World Trade Organisation arbitrator. "In the parallel Boeing dispute, the determination of EU retaliation rights is also coming closer and the EU will request the WTO-appointed arbitrator to determine the EU\'s retaliation rights," the Commission source said, adding the Commission was preparing so that it could take action after the arbitrator\'s decision. Airbus said it saw no legal basis for the US move and warned of deepening transatlantic trade tensions. The European Union is already facing US tariffs on its steel and aluminium exports and President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to hit EU cars with punitive duties.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told a conference in Paris that the two sides needed to reach a friendly agreement. "When I see the situation global growth is in, I don\'t think we can afford to have a trade conflict even if only on the specific issues of the aircraft industry in the United States and Europe," he said. The two sides are closing in on the climax of a record subsidy dispute that has been grinding its way through the WTO for almost 15 years. Both sides have won partial victories in claiming Airbus and Boeing received unlawful subsidies but disagree on the amount involved and whether each has complied with earlier WTO rulings. The US tariffs proposal put pressure on shares in European makers of aircraft and aerospace suppliers, wine, cheese and luxury goods. This morning Airbus shares were down 1.6 percent. Airbus suppliers such as Safran and Leonardo lost between 1.0 percent and 1.2 percent. MTU Aero Engines was 2.5 percent weaker and Rolls-Royce down 1.3 percent.

Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer, who succeeded Angela Merkel as party leader, warned that Britain’s turbulent departure from the EU should silence European campaigns to quit the Brussels project. The new CDU leader is attempting to use Brexit to quash eurosceptic movements in her own country ahead of the European Parliament elections. She accused Theresa May for allowing the British Government’s agenda to be hijacked by populists.
Pro-European candidates fear that Brexit and the UK’s continued presence in the EU could wreak havoc to their campaigns ahead of the May vote. In an interview with Germany’s Welt am Sonntag newspaper, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer said: “It should be clear to everyone what happens when the populists can set the agenda. “There are also parties in Germany that support leaving the EU. “Everyone can see in the example of Britain what consequences that would have.”
Angela Merkel successor Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (L) says Brexit is an example to eurosceptics
Her comments were echoed by Germany’s European affairs minister Michael Roth, who described the Brexit negotiations as a “s***show”. In an undiplomatic attack on Britain, he said: “Brexit is a big s***show, I say that now very undiplomatically.” He also suggested “90 percent” Mrs May’s Cabinet have “no idea how workers think, live, work and behave” and politicians “born with silver spoons in their mouths, who went to private schools and elite universities” won’t suffer the consequences. MPs will attempt to seize control of Brexit this evening in a second attempt to challenge Mrs May\'s controversial EU withdrawal deal.
Politicians will vote on, depending on the Speaker John Bercow’s choices, up to nine alternative Brexit options. Included in the current list a second referendum, remaining in the EU’s customs union and the so-called ‘Common Market 2.0’ approach, which would see the UK remain in the single market with a complex customs arrangement. Any of tonight’s winners could be pitched against the Prime Minister in a fourth vote on her Brexit deal tomorrow. Downing Street will likely confirm its own plans after the indicative votes scheduled for around 8pm tonight. Liz Truss, chief secretary to the Treasury, claimed "it\'s not clear something like a customs union actually commands support". Remainer MPs would crash Mrs May\'s Government if they force the Prime Minister to pursue a customs union.


Brexit news: Nadhim Zahawi warned entering EU elections would be a \'suicide note\' for the Tories
The Conservative Party has been engaged in Brexit talks with the Labour Party after the Prime Minister reached out to Jeremy Corbyn last week to help try to deliver Britain’s exit from the EU. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Education minister, Nadhim Zahawi, warned a further Brexit delay which sees the UK fighting the EU elections in May would be a "suicide note" for the Tory Party. Mr Zahawi added the talks with the Labour Party are "ongoing and we hope that they deliver an outcome that allows Labour to support the withdrawal agreement".
But the Tory frontbencher added that if Labour could not sign up to a joint approach with the Government, MPs should be forced to find a compromise through a preferential voting system in order to resolve the deadlock. He said: “If we can\'t get Labour to agree I think it\'s important that Parliament acts quickly now to decide what it is in favour of - whether it is through some voting mechanism where we have a single transferable vote and we vote on all the different deals. "We need to do that quickly because I think going into the EU elections for the Conservative Party, or indeed for the Labour Party, and telling our constituents why we haven\'t been able to deliver Brexit I think would be an existential threat. "I would go further and say it would be the suicide note of the Conservative Party."

The Conservative minister also said the UK faced a "seismic" political shift with the rise of the hard-left and hard-right if Brexit was not delivered. He said: “I could easily see a scenario in our politics where populist parties on the hard-left and the hard-right would say ‘your mainstream politicians have lied to you, not delivered on their promise’. “\'They promised you they would deliver the instruction you gave them at the referendum, 17.4 million people voted for\', it was a close run thing, which is why I think Mrs May’s deal such a good compromise, but since we don’t deliver that, I think there could easily be a seismic change in our politics.” He added: “We need to find out what Parliament will accept and then make a judgment as to whether that delivers Brexit.
“If we do not deliver Brexit we would be unleashing forces that I think could get this country, and indeed the rest of Europe, into a very bad place.” Mr Zahawi claimed Parliament\'s opposition to a no-deal Brexit meant "we are at the mercy of the 27 other countries" in the EU. He said: ”If we do pass the withdrawal agreement and ratify it then we can leave. All other options will be ceding control to the EU27.” It comes as Chancellor Philip Hammond said there were "no red lines" from the Government side in the ongoing talks with Labour.


Unchecked migration has been blamed for creating ghost towns populated only by the elderly
German chancellor Angela Merkel lobbied hard for mass migration after it became clear in 2015 German industry could grind to a halt without a million-strong injection of cheap labour. But, as the young and ambitious next generation of wealth-creators headed from smaller, poorer states in the east to bigger wealthier nations like the Germany, France and the UK the countries they left behind were left facing economic hardship and financial ruin. Today Romania’s finance minister Eugen Teodorovici again blamed European Union’s unchecked migration policy for a crippling “brain drain” which was crushing his country’s ability to compete and called on the EU to end the brain drain. Express.co.uk highlighted this cruel spin-off of western nations taking eastern Europe’s brightest and best in a series of exclusive articles, written by reporter Zoie O’Brien. We are reprinting a key article below as it remains as relevant – perhaps more relevant – today as it was three years ago. It focuses on Albania – slated to become a member of the EU in 2020 – but the plight of that nation’s towns is mirrored across swathes of eastern Europe. GHOST TOWNS of Albania – the terrible cost of Merkel’s unchecked Euro migration ANGELA Merkel’s EU policy encouraging unchecked mass movement of young people from poor European areas to rich ones is creating GHOST TOWNS across the continent. THE TRUE cost of the EU’s controversial push for unchecked migration was laid bare again today as it became clear rich western nations like Germany were gobbling up the wealth- creating resources of smaller, poorer counties leaving them facing economic ruin. The massive unchecked migration, encouraged by EU policies, is turning already financially weak nations into economic basket cases and leaving a glut of dying towns and villages populated only by old people. In Albania – which is tabled to become an EU member by 2020 - almost ALL young people dream of new lives in Britain or Germany. Many of them are already working here illegally. Germany in particular needs massive inward migration to keep its powerhouse economy moving and, as Express.co.uk reporter Zoie O’Brien discovered as she travelled in Albania, young Albanians are only to happy to provide that labour. But the knock-on effect is that their home nations are left with little or no young labour force to create the wealth for the next generation.
The reality of this situation was made evident to our reporter triggering fears nations like Albania would never recover and have to be propped up by EU cash. Talks between the EU and Albania about the Balkan state joining are at an advanced stage after a meeting last night.
Yes, I want to go to England. I love the UK Albanian teen Visa Llah
Already thousands of Albanian nationals have flocked to the UK in search of better wages and living conditions, and the impact on their struggling economy is being felt across the nation. But, decision makers in Europe are taking their bid to join the union seriously, with some saying they could be a member state as soon as 2020. And thousands are counting on membership, so they can leave their homeland legally. Poverty in the country is described by its people as \'catastrophic\' with huge numbers of unemployed young people. In the last six years, 30 per cent of the 3 million population has left the country and are living abroad.
But the stats paint a false picture according to the younger members of society who admit they work illegally in Europe. And the authorities claim they have no idea how many have left illegally. Visa Llah, 17, dreams of working in the UK as his older brother does now. He said: "The young people here it is difficult for them to find a job. Some of them they just leave Albania and go to wherever they can find a little work. "My friends, they don\'t earn anything. This is our chance to join Europe. We are really trying to get going in the union and really I want to join, I will enjoy it so much. "It will bring more money and more jobs here in Albania. My brother is in London. He really had good work, he is winning money and he really loves the UK.

"My cousins, two of them, they went illegally to the UK and now they are trying to arrange their proper papers. "I try to pay attention in my studies and to learn English because it is the most important language in the world. I have lived in Italy for seven years and sometimes I return to Albania. "Yes, I want to go to England. I love the UK. Maybe because my brother is there but I want to go." A Government employee who did not wished to be named revealed the UK is the destination of choice for the young people, claiming thousands will head for Britain rather than easier to reach countries.

He said: "The UK is heaven for Albanians. It is their favourite destination, who cares about Italy and Germany? "They work like dogs and at the end of the month they say it was worth it. Thousands will come. The first wave will be people with family in the UK and the second will be when people raise funds for the trip." The average earnings in Albania are €350 per month. But jobs are rare and rent can be expensive. One man told Express.co.uk he has no choice but to work in Italy for three months at a time.
Many young Albanians already work in the EU illegally
Besi, 28, said: "Young people in Albania are just drinking coffee every day. It is very difficult to find a job here. "If you don\'t have friends with benefits, like business, it is very hard. So we go to Itlay and Germany to earn money and we come home. "The people in the north of Albania and emigrating to the UK. Thousands, because they are very poor. They go to London." Albanians can visit EU countries without a visa for three months at a time legally, since they were given Schengen membership. But this does not entitle them to work.

Arta, 33, who once lived with Albania\'s many street families in ramshackle huts outside of the city centre, moved to Italy with her son for a new life. She said: "Everything is catastrophic. "There is no work. I live in Italy now, when I compare it, the situation here is devastating. Life is so difficult. "Life in Europe to here is incomparable. The people here they really look forward to leaving for another country. They are hoping one day they will leave."


Germany news: The German economy has been hit by a downgrade in growth forecast
The sharp revision has seen the growth forecast for Europe’s biggest economy downgraded to 0.8 percent from a previous estimate of 1.9 percent.
The report warned how a hard Brexit, if Britain should leave the European Union with a deal in place, would further damped the prospects of the German economy.
It comes after a string of weak data releases in recent months pointed to an economic downturn in Germany.
The report read: ”The long-term upswing of the German economy is over.”

Theresa May said she would seek a longer extension past next week to allow talks with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to ensure Britain leaves the EU. But, the move has angered Brexit supporters, with some members of the Conservative Party’s eurosceptic European Research Group claiming it is time for Mrs May to step down. Speaking on Channel 4 News, Conservative Brexiteer Anne Marie Morris claimed Mrs May had “sacrificed” the 17.4million people who voted Leave, and issued a warning to the Prime Minister.
She said: “I think it is the 17.4million people who have been sacrificed because what now is on the table, frankly is simply not Brexit. “It is not delivering a Leave result, because what she is clearly looking at is a deal with Labour which effectively will be a customs union. “This does not deliver Brexit. It is something which is unacceptable. I expected her at this point…to recognise there would not be a deal and we would be better off outside negotiating from a better position.” The Brexiteer added: “We have far from given up and I think you will find there are lots of deeply frustrated Conservatives whatever way they voted on the withdrawal agreement that frankly will never vote for again.

“I would hold your conclusions and wait to see what unrolls and unravels. There are all sorts of moving parts here. It is partly what goes on in Parliament, and remember whatever has to get through both Houses. “It is partly about Europe, and whether or not they will grant an extension. I think she is a bit hopeful to think Brussels will grant her an extension until May 22 to avoid the European elections.” After a mammoth Cabinet meeting discussing the future of Brexit, the Prime Minister reached out to the Labour Party leader to help deliver Britain’s exit from the bloc. Mrs May said: “The ideal outcome of this process would be to agree an approach on a future relationship that delivers on the result of the referendum, that both the leader of the Opposition and I could put to the House for approval and which I could then take to next week\'s European Council.
"However, if we cannot agree on the single unified approach, then we would instead agree a number of options for the future relationship that we could put to the House in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue. "Crucially, the Government stands ready to abide by the decision of the House. But to make this process work, the opposition would need to agree to this too." In response, Mr Corbyn said he would not set any "limits" ahead of the meeting with the Prime Minister, but that his principles ahead of it were to recognise the "needs of the people that elected all MPs to Parliament and the need to avoid the dangers of crashing out". European Research Group (ERG) chairman Mr Rees-Mogg criticised the Prime Minister for planning to collaborate with "a known Marxist" in the Labour leader. He said: "I think getting the support of a known Marxist is not likely to instil confidence in Conservatives. This approach to Government is an unsuccessful one and it also lacks democratic legitimacy.


Theresa May met with Jeremy Corbyn last week after the Prime Minister reached out to the Labour Party leader to try to deliver Brexit. Mrs May has warned that no Brexit at all remains a possibility and claimed she has done “everything in my power” to persuade Tory MPs and DUP MPs to back her withdrawal agreement, which has been rejected three times. Leading Brexit supporter and Conservative MP for North East Somerset, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has claimed the Prime Minister only has herself to blame for not delivering Brexit.
Jacob Rees-Mogg told Sophy Ridge: “I would question the failure to get enough support for no deal. You are quite right, Parliament has passed motions objecting to a no deal Brexit. “But, it passed two laws which provided for us to leave on March 29 which was subsequently delayed. Law trumps motions and the Prime Minister could have taken us out on March 29, it was the Prime Minister who asked for an extension. “It was the Prime Minister who changed the date by prerogative power from March 29 to April 12. This all rests with her and on her shoulders. “She has made, the Prime Minister Mrs May has made active choices to stop us leaving and she deserves to be held to account for that, because people ought to know the truth of the position, rather than trying to blame everybody else.”

Mrs May has made active choices to stop us leaving and she deserves to be held to account for that Jacob Rees-Mogg
He added: “If the Prime Minister had done what she said in the first place and stuck to the law as set out in two acts we would have left the European Union by now.” The Prime Minister said she had done "everything in my power" to persuade Tory and DUP MPs to back her deal but acknowledged the withdrawal agreement had been rejected by the Commons three times and "there is no sign it can be passed in the near future". She said: ”Because Parliament has made clear it will stop the UK leaving without a deal, we now have a stark choice: leave the European Union with a deal or do not leave at all. "My answer to that is clear: we must deliver Brexit and to do so we must agree a deal. If we cannot secure a majority among Conservative and DUP MPs we have no choice but to reach out across the House of Commons.
"The referendum was not fought along party lines and people I speak to on the doorstep tell me they expect their politicians to work together when the national interest demands it. "The fact is that on Brexit there are areas where the two main parties agree: we both want to end free movement, we both want to leave with a good deal, and we both want to protect jobs. "That is the basis for a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament and winning that majority is the only way to deliver Brexit." On Friday, Mrs May wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to the Article 50 process until June 30.


Right-wing eurosceptics are set to dominate the polls in France and Italy, Nigel Farage could return to Brussels and the fight to become Jean-Claude Juncker’s successor could turn nasty – a growing list of potential disasters await the upcoming European elections. Matteo Salvini’s League are set to return the largest number of seats in Italy and Marine Le Pen’s National Rally is in a close battle to win the top spot from Emmanuel Macron’s La Republique En Marche in France, according to Politico. Mr Salvini is already manoeuvring to position himself as the unofficial leader of a populist bloc when the EU Parliament’s new MEPs first convene in July.
The Italian deputy prime minister hopes to bring together right-wing MEPs from Hungary, Austria and Poland, where populists are in power, and France and the Netherlands, where support for them is growing. Lega’s European election manifesto will “underline and reaffirm common Christian roots, defend national identity and the supremacy of the Italian constitution over European laws and directives”. The right-wingers will oppose European integration and austerity policies. According to reports in Italian media, Mr Salvini will host a event in Milan next week to secure the support of eurosceptics from over 20 countries for his parliamentary alliance. European eurosceptics could be joined by their British counterparts in the new Parliament, if Theresa May agrees to participate in the election in exchange for a long delay to Brexit.
EU Parliament elections set to give Brussels a massive headache
Mr Farage’s Brexit Party are primed and ready to put candidates forward for the ballot, which could take place on May 23 in the UK. Last month the former Ukip leader told MEPs in what he hoped was his “penultimate” speech in a European Parliament plenary session but said he would return if the Prime Minister and Brussels agree a long Brexit delay. Mr Farage said: “You’ve got your plan. You want the United States of Europe, you want your army, you want everyone to join the Euro, you want to get rid of the nation-states. We are just a damned nuisance. “In the European elections, you don’t want me coming back here, or hordes of Eurosceptics coming back here.” Yesterday Guy Verhofstadt, the EU Parliament\'s Brexit co-ordinator, told MEPs: "We cannot risk giving the keys of the EU’s future to a Boris Johnson, or a Michael Gove, the architects of this Brexit disaster. A long extension would do exactly that."
But the biggest row amongst pro-Europeans could breakout in the effort to replace Mr Juncker as European Commission president, with the 64-year-old set to step down in October. German MEP Manfred Weber successfully became the so-called Spitzenkandidat for the centre-right European People\'s Party – the process that hands the top job to the lead candidate from the biggest EU Parliament group. However, his credentials have been challenged and even Michel Barnier, the EU\'s chief Brexit negotiator, has been touted as a last-minute candidate for the role. Mr Weber has claimed any attempt to oust him from the running for Commission president would be seen as anti-democratic by EU citizens.


Prime Minister Theresa May will make a personal plea to France’s Emmanuel Macron in Paris today not to veto her request for a further delay to Brexit. Mrs May will also hold talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin to try and bolster support for her request to delay Brexit until June 30. EU leaders will be under pressure to decide whether to grant Britain another delay, a decision that can be vetoed by any of the other 27 member states.
Emmanuel Macron really has sold himself as Mr Europe and that’s the message that he keeps pushing Catherine Nicholson
But France 24’s Catherine Nicholson said the French President is set to take a hard line against the UK at an EU summit on Wednesday over fears the Brexit deadlock is destabilising the EU. She told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “Emmanuel Macron, he keeps repeating that it’s Europe’s interests that really has to come first here. “He really has sold himself as Mr Europe and that’s the message that he keeps pushing.” President Macron could demand there be no extension of the Article 50 process unless the Prime Minister signs up to binding commitments to stand aside from the EU decision-making process.

Whereas Max Hoffman, who is Bureau Chief at Deutsche Welle in Brussels, said Angela Merkel is likely to be more patient than any other EU leader. Mr Hoffman added: “Angela Merkel is most likely one of those willing to have the most patience with the UK Government. “She has repeatedly said that there is still time. “And I have no doubt, just like many colleagues here in Brussels, that she will try and up until the last minute to avoid a no deal Brexit.”


Police clashed with thousands of migrants in disturbing scenes
Greek officers fired tear gas as angry migrants hoping to make their way to northern Europe hurled stones and bottles after being barred from reaching a nearby border crossing, witnesses said. Syrian refugee Yaser said: “We don\'t want to fight with the Greek police. We want to go to Europe, we don\'t want to stay in Greece.” Wife Fatemeh, who was carrying their six-month old baby, said the family was determined to stay at the makeshift camp. She added: “We will stay here until the borders open, we don\'t have any other choice.”
Spurred by a fake rumour about border openings that had spread on social media, hundreds of migrants and refugees arrived and pitched tents on Thursday in a field next to the Diavata migrant camp near Greece\'s border with North Macedonia. In neighbouring Turkey, nearly 1,200 migrants heading toward the border with Greece following false rumours that Ankara had opened its frontier were detained on Friday, Turkish media said.There were dozens of tents in the field and riot police formed a cordon to block an access route, parking 20 buses to stop the migrants from leaving the field. Authorities also sent buses to take people back to housing settlements.
Greek officers fired tear gas as angry migrants
At midday, riot police fired teargas at dozens of people - some carrying children - who hurled stones and bottles as they tried to break through the police cordon and reach the main road leading to the border. The scuffles lasted for several hours and thick plumes of smoke rose over the fields as police fired flares to disperse the crowds and angry migrants started small fires. Jana Frey, country director for the International Rescue Committee Greece, said the unrest highlighted "the amount of false information being presented to asylum seekers and refugees."

Aerial footage from Saltdean, Brighton captured protestors lining up over a cliff to launch a "symbolic SOS call" against Brexit. More than 400 people came together on the south coast of England to ask for the help of the European Union with mirrors to flash their distress call across the Channel. Artist Duncan McKellar set up the anti-Brexit stunt with the help of several volunteers who pitched up their mirrors around midday on Monday.
Mr McKellar acted with the permission of the local coastguard branch. The British artist last year organised a similar protest with volunteers standing at the US-Mexico border wearing mirror masks. The footage was shared on social media where the lineup sparked a hilarious response from the British public. One social media user said: "Makes a change. Those SOS messages have more traditionally come in the opposite direction." Another also cited historical events to suggest the protestors will not receive support from Brussels: "If they know anything about history they will be waiting a very long time to be rescued by Europe. On the other hand when Europe came calling..." LISTEN HERE: Latest Brexit news from the Express.co.uk Final Countdown podcast

Another took a dig at the French specifically, commenting: "Apparently the French mistook it for gunfire and surrendered." As emotions continue to run high among British voters, with Leave and Remain supporters holding protest marches within days of each other last week to either demand an immediate Brexit or a revocation of Article 50, Theresa May is hoping to find out the will of MPs with a series of indicative votes on Monday evening. MPs will consider rival options including the idea of staying in a customs union with the bloc, and a so-called Common Market 2.0. EU officials have accused them of being “detached from reality” - and warned the choice comes down to Mrs May’s divorce deal or a lengthy delay to the process of leaving the EU. Diplomats have said the Prime Minister’s deal is non-negotiable, and with the UK’s exit currently scheduled for April 12, they have warned rival plans would not excuse Britain from taking part in elections to the European Parliament, scheduled for May 23-26.

The Ukip leader and MEP shocked the European Parliament with his speech in which he ridiculed European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker and Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier for working with Remainer “traitors” in Britain to scupper Brexit. During a fiery European Parliament speech, the MEP said the Brexit vote is “the only weapon the ordinary people have” as he urged Britons to vote for his party in EU elections. Mr Batten said: “Has the whole Brexit process fiasco been an elaborate conspiracy between Mrs May and the EU or is it just due to her monumental incompetence?
By all means ban me and watch my vote go up in the United Kingdom Gerard Batten
“Either way we have to hand it to you Mr Juncker and Mr Barnier – you have done what Philip of Spain, what Napoleon, what Kaiser Wilhelm and Hitler couldn’t do. “You have brought Britain to its knees without firing a single shot.” SNP MEP Alyn Smith branded Mr Batten’s speech a “disgrace” and was greeted with a round of applause as he told MEPs: “He does not speak for the people of the United Kingdom. “He barely speaks for his own party such as it still exists. “To use that sort of rhetoric in this house of democracy utterly shameful.

“Can I suggest that you and the presidency think whether or not this house should continue to give a platform to these to recurse for their poison. Thank you.” In response, Vice President of the European Parliament Mairead McGuinness shut down the MEP’s attempts to respond and said: “Excuse me, Mr Batten, I have the microphone and I will speak and then I may allow you to speak. “Can I say that I will definitely bring your issue to the president? I was also concerned about the use of another term, punishment beating, I find that a difficult term in the context of my own country. Sir, do you have a point?” Mr Batten then was given the microphone and roared: “This gentleman represents the party it claims it wants independence and yet it is happy to be subservient to the European Union.” The British MEP then raised his voice once more and shouted: “By all means ban me and watch my vote go up in the United Kingdom.” Britain is set to leave the EU without a deal on April 12 but leaders will convene with Theresa May days before in an attempt to negotiate another Brexit delay.


BBC host Martha Kearney pointed out to the Independent Group politician that MPs had rejected every proposal, apart from avoiding a no deal, in the Commons. None of the Brexit alternative amendments reached a majority in the Commons on Monday evening, prompting the Prime Minister to call a mammoth Cabinet meeting to try to find a way forward. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Ms Kearney quizzed Ms Soubry as the Independent Group voted against Ken Clarke’s proposal for a permanent customs union.
The host said: “You have had two days now of indicative votes and MPs have completely failed to unite around any kind of compromise.” The MP for Broxtowe said she did “not accept” that analysis, saying: “We have made progress in a days worth of debate than two years of this Government.” The BBC presenter Kearney snapped back: “But, all the votes have been lost haven’t they. “No single option has come forward. You have rejected everything.

All the votes have been lost haven’t they Martha Kearney
“The only thing that MPs are agreeing on is that they don’t want no deal.” During the BBC interview, the Independent Group MP outlined why they did not back the customs union amendment which was rejected by a majority of three votes. Ms Soubry said: “It doesn’t deliver the regulatory alignment which is needed for the frictionless trade. “I made that very clear point to Ken last week and I made it again last night.” The Prime Minister and her senior ministers met on Tuesday morning after MPs failed to find a majority for any Brexit alternative. A call for a customs union with the EU was rejected by just three votes, while demand for a second referendum was defeated by 12 and a Norway-style deal put forward by Nick Boles by 21.


Julian Smith, the Conservative Party chief whip launched a furious attack on the cabinet over the way they have managed the Brexit process. Mr Smith claimed the discipline within the divided cabinet was “not as good as it should be” adding he was growing “frustrated”. The Conservative Party chief whip also claimed the Government should have been clearer about the consequences of the 2017 general election result and that it would “inevitably” lead to “a kind of softer type of Brexit”.
He told the BBC: “The thing that people forget is that the Conservative Party went to get a majority in order to deliver Brexit, failed to get a majority. “The Government as a whole probably should have just been clear on the consequences of that. “The Parliamentary arithmetic would mean that this would be inevitably a kind of softer type of Brexit.” He added: “The EU are playing pretty hardball. I’m knackered dealing with colleagues 24/7.

The worst example of ill-discipline in cabinet in British political history Julian Smith
“Frustrated with the fact that people don’t see the light as clearly as I do. “As you’re aware, discipline is not as good as it should be. This is, I think, the worst example of ill-discipline in cabinet in British political history.” The revealing interview with Laura Kuenssberg will air on Monday evening as MPs prepare to hold further indicative votes to find a solution to the Brexit stalemate. Responding to the interview, former Conservative Party MP and now the interim leader of Change UK - The Independent Group, Heidi Allen, tweeted: “He’s not wrong! A few us have been saying it and saying it……”
Political correspondent for ITV News, Paul Brand, tweeted: “Understand Chief Whip agreed to BBC documentary assuming it would be retrospective. Hence he is so candid. But in the end delayed events mean it’s being aired before any Brexit deal has passed / resolution has been found.” He later added: “Although am also told final interview with him was on Friday, so maybe he’s quite happy to let rip!” The Prime Minister’s Brexit withdrawal agreement was defeated on Friday afternoon by MPs in the House of Commons by 344 votes to 286. Speaking after the defeat, Mrs May said: “This House has rejected no deal. It has rejected no Brexit. On Wednesday it rejected all the variations of the deal on the table. “And today it has rejected approving the withdrawal agreement alone and continuing a process on the future. “This Government will continue to press the case for the orderly Brexit that the result of the referendum demands."


Germany news: The German economy has been hit by a downgrade in growth forecast
The sharp revision has seen the growth forecast for Europe’s biggest economy downgraded to 0.8 percent from a previous estimate of 1.9 percent. The report warned how a hard Brexit, if Britain should leave the European Union with a deal in place, would further damped the prospects of the German economy. It comes after a string of weak data releases in recent months pointed to an economic downturn in Germany. As well as the threat of a no-deal Brexit, the German economy has been facing headwinds from a slowing world economy and international trade disputes between the United States and China.
The report read: ”The long-term upswing of the German economy is over.” However, the news was not all bad with the economic researchers forecasting a strong increase in growth in 2020. The report is predicting gross domestic product (GDP) for Germany to increase by 1.8 percent for next year. Last year, the German economy grew by 1.4 percent, while in 2017, GDP had risen by 2.2 percent.
The release of the report came at the same time as yet another disappointing data set heightened concerns over Germany enduring a weak start to 2019. German industrial orders fell at their sharpest rate in more than two years in February as they were hit by a slump in foreign demand. According to the Economy Ministry, contracts for German goods slumped by 4.2 percent. This is a significant increase from the fall of 2.1 percent in January, revised from a drop of 2.6 percent. The unexpected fall was the sharpest since January 2017 and confounded forecasts for a 0.3 percent increase. ING economist Carsten Brzeski said: “Awful new order data suggests that German industry is still suffering from Brexit woes and global uncertainties."


The European Union may let Britain “resign to its own fate” and leave the Brussels bloc without a Brexit agreement, Bernard Purcell from The Irish World has claimed. Theresa May sent a letter to EU Council President Donald Tusk on Friday asking for an extension to Article 50 until June 30, as she continues talks with the Labour Party to try to find a solution to Brexit. Speaking on BBC’s Dateline London, Mr Purcell warned of a “certain kind of fatalism” from some member states to allow the UK to leave with no deal.
He said: “Yes, Macron has said that Ireland and France are the two that would face the most disruption. “The Netherlands has been putting arrangements in place for the last two years. “The Dutch are supportive of Britain. They feel affection towards it, they do not like to see what is happening. “Ireland is the same, you have the same with Germany. You have the same with the Scandinavian states.

There is a certain kind of fatalism that people might have to allow Britain to resign to its own fate Bernard Purcell
“But, at the moment, there is a certain kind of fatalism that people might have to allow Britain to resign to its own fate.” On Friday, Mrs May wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to the Article 50 process until June 30. The Prime Minister said she will seek to ratify her withdrawal agreement before the European Parliament elections on May 23, but will make "responsible preparations" to take part if that does not prove possible. Mrs May said if ongoing talks with Labour do not lead to a "single unified approach soon" then the Government would instead look to establish a "consensus" on options on a future relationship that could be put to the Commons.
In her letter, she wrote: "I am writing therefore to inform the European Council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty. "The United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June 2019. If the parties are able to ratify before this date, the Government proposes that the period should be terminated early. "The Government will want to agree a timetable for ratification that allows the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union before 23 May 2019 and therefore cancel the European Parliament elections, but will continue to make responsible preparations to hold the elections should this not prove possible." Reports suggest Mr Tusk is recommending a longer postponement of one year, with a break clause in the case of earlier ratification, in a so-called "flextension" deal.


With May’s vote just weeks away, experts say anti-EU parties have a chance to impact the future of the European Union if they join forces to work together. Far-right leaders share the broad ideological goals of curbing the EU\'s perceived liberal course and returning power to the member states\' capitals. But they differ in other areas. Investors expect heightened political uncertainty after the May 26 election, in which 705 members of the European Parliament MEPs will be elected, or 751 if Britain fails to leave the EU as planned.
General dissatisfaction over slow economic growth, security threats posed by Islamist militants and a backlash against migration across open EU borders have boosted support for eurosceptic nationalists in many member states. Susi Dennison, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said: "There is a growing confidence of voters to go against the norm. "The \'anti- forces\' are much more motivated right now than the pro-Europeans." Their gains and Brexit will mean a shake-up of the pan-national groups created by parties in the EU parliament, whose main role is checking and amending EU laws drawn up by the executive European Commission. Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini will launch his election campaign tomorrow in Milan, with a call to other eurosceptic parties across the continent to join forces with his League to form a new alliance within Brussels.
The EU elections are set to see a rise in eurosceptic parties, experts say
Buoyed by his own success and voter fatigue with mainstream parties, Salvini is trying to build bridges with the likes of French far-right leader Marine Le Pen and Austrian far-right politician Heinz-Christian Strache the May 26 vote. With the two biggest political blocs expected to lose their combined majority, he and other far-right leaders hope to form an opposition, eurosceptic alliance with enough seats in the assembly to block or hold up legislation. Salvini\'s foreign affairs advisor Marco Zanni said: "Our idea is to come together ... into a new party that better reflects the eurosceptical views that unite us. "Now is our chance to unite forces once and for all." Salvini\'s anti-immigrant League is forecast to more than quadruple its representation in the EU assembly with 27 seats.

Along with the projected rise for Le Pen\'s National Rally and Strache\'s Freedom Party of Austria, which is in a coalition government with Strache as vice-chancellor, the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) group to which they belong could be boosted to 61 seats from 37. Salvini, whose party co-rules Italy, wants to embrace other leaders whose parties are in rival groups. Even if parties do not come together, their presence in the European Parliament could create cracks in the EU. Mr Zanni of Salvini\'s League said there will be greater cooperation to try to influence or thwart EU policy. Ms Dennison added: "The risk is longer-term paralysis, that over time will erode the idea of EU as an effective actor." Duncan McDonnell, Professor of Politics in the School of Government and International Relations at Griffith University said the far-right increasingly saw itself as "part of a new wave".

Alastair Campbell revealed Brexit supporter Julia Hartley-Brewer was the “Leaver” former British Prime Minister Tony Blair “liked” during a radio interview. Mr Blair’s former head of communications, Mr Campbell claimed he could “destroy” Julia’s credibility by revealing the former prime minister’s admission. The Brexiteer radio host burst out laughing once hearing the remark, before pointing out one thing “in common” she shares with Mr Blair.
Mr Campbell told talkRADIO: “I have just been on the phone to the leader of the last strong and stable government that Britain had - namely Tony Blair. “I said to him, ‘Tony, I have to go because I am just about to do a radio interview’. “He said ‘who is that with’ and I said Julia Hartley-Brewer’. “Do you know what he said? Because this is going to destroy your credibility, Julia.

“He said ‘she is the Leaver I like’.” The radio host burst out laughing, before saying: “Well, I did do an event with Tony Blair some months ago, and we discovered something in his speech, we do have something in common because he is not allowed to go to Labour Party conference either.” It comes following another chaotic evening in the House of Commons after MPs voted to seek a delay to Brexit rather than risk the UK crashing out of the bloc on April 12, which was passed by 313 votes to 312. Tory Mark Francois, the MP for Rayleigh and Wickford, reacted to the Bill\'s passing with anger, calling it a "constitutional outrage" On Thursday Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will meet with the Prime Minister again to try to find a solution to the Brexit deadlock. Theresa May reached out to the opposition earlier this week after a mammoth 7-hour Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.


The former Italian leader warned the European Union a surge of support for populist parties could spark a quick succession of Brexit-like departures among member states. The warning from Enrico Letta came as deputy Italian Prime Minister Matteo Salvini pledged to form a coalition of eurosceptic member states to end the EU "nightmare." Speaking to CNBC, Mr Letta said: "It is clear the victory of populist parties will bring, one after the other, 28 Brexits.
"The day after Brexit, if you take now the cause of Le Pen, Salvini, these people were happy of Brexit and they were saying to their countries ‘look at the British, they took the right decision, we have to do the same’. "Take the quotes of Salvini and di Maio on Italy. They were saying that we need to have a referendum, too, we have to decide in the same way." With May’s vote just weeks away, experts say anti-EU parties have a chance to impact the future of the European Union if they join forces to work together. Investors expect heightened political uncertainty after the May 26 election, in which 705 members of the European Parliament MEPs will be elected, or 751 if Britain fails to leave the EU as planned.

Mr Letta however insisted the changes of a complete change of structure of the European Parliament in favour of eurosceptic parties is unlikely. He continued: "My point is that I’m sure that populists won’t win the next European election. "They will be marginalised by the vote because they are divided and the European Parliament is a parliament where, if you are in a minority, you only have droit de tribune, nothing more." Buoyed by his own success and voter fatigue with mainstream parties, Mr Salvini has been trying to build bridges with the likes of French far-right leader Marine Le Pen and Austrian far-right politician Heinz-Christian Strache.

Nigel Farage claimed he was “absolutely” sure Brexit would be delivered after a Sky News host asked him if “his vision had died”. Mr Farage also said the longer extension allowed the British people go to out and vote in European elections and show their frustration. Speaking on Sky News, host Isabel Webster, said: “Just the very fact we are talking about delays to Brexit, down that in many ways mean that Brexit is over really.
“That it is a pipe dream, that your vision has died now.” Mr Farage replied: “Well, let’s be frank, the Prime Minister and most people in the Houses of Parliament have done their best to try to kill Brexit stone dead. “They have done it by endlessly kicking the can down the road. “But, what they haven’t noticed is the growing anger in this country, and not just among Leave voters, a lot of Remain voters are saying ‘what kind country are we if we don’t keep to our democratic principles’.”
Brexit news: Nigel Farage delivered an epic response after being told his vision had \'died\'
So, do I think Brexit will happen? Absolutely Nigel Farage
He added: “The world is looking on astonished at what has happened to our nation. “So, do I think Brexit will happen? Absolutely, I think Brexit will happen. “I think the genie is out of the bottle, I just fear there are more battles to fight until we get there”. Mr Farage claimed the “one good thing” about extending Article 50 further is “it gives the British people the opportunity on May 23 in a European election to express their view.”
On Friday, Mrs May wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to Article 50 until June 30. The Prime Minister said she will seek to ratify her withdrawal agreement before the European Parliament elections on May 23, but will make "responsible preparations" to take part if that does not prove possible. In her letter, she wrote: "I am writing, therefore, to inform the European Council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty. "The United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June 2019. If the parties are able to ratify before this date, the Government proposes that the period should be terminated early. "The Government will want to agree a timetable for ratification that allows the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union before 23 May 2019 and therefore cancel the European Parliament elections, but will continue to make responsible preparations to hold the elections should this not prove possible." Mrs May said if ongoing talks with Labour do not lead to a "single unified approach soon" then the Government would instead look to establish a "consensus" on options on a future relationship that could be put to the Commons.


Theresa May is set to meet with the Labour Party leader for further Brexit talks after she reached out to Jeremy Corbyn to try to get a deal through the House of Commons. The move from the Prime Minister frustrated many Conservative MPs with some members of the Tory party’s eurosceptic European Research Group calling for Mrs May to step down. Speaking on ITV’s Peston on Wednesday evening, Brexit supporter and Conservative MP Nadine Dorries shocked Alastair Campbell by pointing out that voting for Britain to remain in the customs union would be worse than leaving the bloc.
She said: “She invited Jeremy Corbyn to Number 10 weeks ago. That’s when he walked out when he saw Chuka Umunna. “I think Parliament and Parliamentarians are letting the public down. “They voted in a referendum, they voted for Brexit. Parliamentarians are not getting behind the deal, they are not doing what they are supposed to. “Everybody is holding on to their own political ideology and not putting the country first. That is the problem.”

I would not vote for a customs union because we may as well stay in Nadine Dorries
She added: “If Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May between them can come up with something that is acceptable, which is Brexit, which lets us free to go onto the next stage.” ITV’s Peston interrupted the Tory MP asking whether she would accept the UK remaining in the customs union. Ms Dorries replied: “I would not vote for a customs union because we may as well stay in.” Mr Campbell threw his hands into the air before he smirked shaking his head while sitting on the panel.


Emmanuel Macron was challenged for his opposition to a lengthy Brexit delay after European leaders discussed nine-hours before conceding Britain a six-month extension. The French President has had to contend with growing dissent toward his leadership during the past year, with protesters rioting across France for 19 weekends in a row to oppose his tax and reform plans. Swedish MEP Peter Lundgren warned Mr Macron to focus on issues facing him at home and to avoid bringing "that mess" to European institutions.
Mr Lundgren told Channel 4 News: "President Macron, he has his hands full at home, I would say. "If you look at what happened, he promised everything to everyone and then he found out it’s not that easy to deliver that. "Now he has massive riots all over France to deal with. So, sorry Mr Macron, we don’t want that mess in the rest of Europe." The Swedish Democrat MEP also suggested the EU had provided the Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage with a boost ahead of the European parliamentary election with their decision to grant an extension.

Brexit news: Lundgren warned Macron not to bring France\'s "mess" to Brussels
The European Parliament elections in 2014 saw Ukip come out on top in a tight contest with 27.49 percent of the vote and 24 MEPs, followed by the Labour Party (25.4 percent and 20 MEPs) and Conservative Party (23.93 percent and 19 MEPs). But with the Brexit crisis engulfing the Tories since the EU referendum results in June 2016, and huge internal splits deepening over their handling of negotiations, the results could look very different in a few weeks time. Mr Lundgren continued: "I think it will be a massive support for Farage. "If they don’t deliver the Brexit as promised, and they go into a second referendum, they will see Farage back in the building with a lot of MEPs with him. "I am sure of that."


Diane Abbott refused to say whether Brits having the final say on any Brexit deal had to be the outcome of EU talks with the Government as she was pressed by a BBC host. The Labour Party has been engaged in negotiations with the Government this week after Theresa May reached out to Jeremy Corbyn to try to get Brexit over the line, which sparked fury among many in the Conservative Party. Speaking on BBC’s Today programme, the shadow home secretary was quizzed over whether a second Brexit vote was a “necessity” of the negotiations with the Government, before she admitted Leave would likely win again.
Ms Abbott said: “The Labour Party is united on the fact a People’s Vote is still on the table, that is the conference position.” Pressed by Webb on whether any agreement with the Government must have a second vote attached to it, Ms Abbott said: "We are not saying anything definitively but we have a position." The BBC host snapped back: “Hold on a second, if you had a position you would be saying it definitively wouldn’t you? “Lots of your support, I imagine quite a lot of people listening now, would be saying, ‘we need another vote and we need Labour, which is overwhelmingly supported actually by people who would like another opportunity to say they want to remain in the EU, we need to have an opportunity to say that’.”
Brexit news: Diane Abbott clashed with BBC\'s Justin Webb
Ms Abbott replied: “People’s Vote was part of the policy package we passed at conference. Of course, you can have different types of People’s Vote, you can have what is called a confirmatory ballot, where you get a deal and you put it back to the people. That’s a standard trade union process, you negotiate a deal, then you bring it back to your members for a vote. “Or you could have a People’s Vote if you thought it was the only way to stop a no deal Brexit, but the principle of the Labour Party supports some kind of People’s Vote was set out in the policy agreed at conference.” The BBC host demanded to know if the British people having another vote after negotiations was a “red line”. Ms Abbott said Labour was a “member led party and the members are being clear on this question of some kind of People’s Vote, so it has to be part of our negotiations with the Government.” The BBC host asked whether it “had to be part of the outcome”, to which the Labour frontbencher replied: “It has to be part of our negotiations.”
We are not saying anything definitively but we have a position Diane Abbott
Webb said: “Hold on a minute Diane, that’s crazy, isn’t it? I understand you go in with various things, but what I am trying to get from you, because it is so important to so many of your supporters, is another referendum an absolute necessity of doing a deal with the Government or is it something that you might say ‘no it’s okay it’s a good enough deal, we will just go with it’.” Ms Abbott replied: “I have said to you we have not gone into these negotiations being dogmatic we have gone into these talks with a preexisting position, and there are different types of People’s Vote that you can have. “There is no question of the Labour Party leadership dismissing the views of the party as expressed at party conference.” Labour’s shadow home secretary said she thought a People’s Vote “has its difficulties” claiming that “if we had that vote tomorrow I believe Leave would win.” During the interview, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: "We engaged in these talks in good faith. Keir Starmer has written to the Government to say he wants to continue the talks, so in that sense, they are going on. There is concern that the Government doesn\'t want to alter the political declaration.” She added: "There\'s no question that the mess we are in is Theresa May\'s mess, even Tory MPs accept that. The Labour Party has stepped up, we want to help. “We are engaged in these talks in good faith but the Government perhaps has to show a little more flexibility than it seems to have done so far."


Theresa May travelled to Brussels on Wednesday to meet with EU leaders after she requested an extension to Britain’s departure from the Brussels bloc. But, Alex Deane a Conservative Party political commentator, has called for Mrs May to “resurrect” her demand of no deal is better than a bad Brexit deal. He told Sky News: “On the Parliamentary side, it would be to resurrect the prospect of no deal.
“For some time our Prime Minister rightly said that no deal is better than a bad deal. “It is the most efficient weapon in her arsenal, the best club in the bag for our side of negotiations, we should never let that prospect go.” The political commentator also called for the EU to take a fresh look at the controversial backstop mechanism within the withdrawal agreement, which posed a major issue for some pro-Brexit Conservative MPs. As she arrived at the EU summit, Mrs May was asked if she was “embarrassed” about having to ask for an extension.

On the Parliamentary side, it would be to resurrect the prospect of no deal Alex Deane
The Prime Minister said: “I know many people will be frustrated that the summit is taking place at all because the UK should have left the EU by now. “I greatly regret the fact that Parliament has not been able to pass a deal that would enable us to leave in a smooth and orderly way.” She added: “But, I and the Government continue to work to find a way forward. We have been talking with the opposition and there have been serious constructive talks. They will continue tomorrow. “The purpose of this summit is to agree to an extension which gives us more time to agree to a deal to enable us to leave the EU in that smooth and orderly way.
“What matters I think is that I have asked for an extension to June 30, but what is important is that any extension enables us to leave at the point of which we ratify the withdrawal agreement. So we could leave on the 22 May and start to build our brighter future.” Speaking in Brussels, EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that any extension to the Article 50 process “must serve a purpose”. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte opened up on the division among the EU27 over the length of any extension. He told reporters: “It is very well possible that we will decide to prevent a no deal Brexit tonight. "We will have several important discussions, on how long will an extension be and what conditions will be attached to it. "There are differing opinions about that. We need to make sure that the EU can function, that all member states cooperate loyally."


The Government announced on Monday they have launched preparations to hold European elections in the United Kingdom should Britain be stuck into a long Brexit extension. A note from a Cabinet Office spokesman suggested the UK would however not be bound to take part in the vote if a deal were to be struck with the European Union before May 22, a day before the expected start of the vote. Nigel Farage suggested the announcement indicates Britain will effectively take part in the vote unless MPs agree to pass through Parliament Theresa May\'s proposed Brexit deal.
Responding to the note on his daily LBC show, Mr Farage said: "Folks, we are having European elections, we are having European elections. "She’ll go to the summit, she’ll beg in Berlin first, she’ll beg in Paris later on, she will then go on to prostrate herself in front of 27 other European leaders and, of course, the big boys like Barnier and Tusk and Juncker. "On Thursday, the legislation will be moved and the nomination for candidates will open this Friday. That’s pretty certain." Theresa May is expected to meet with German leader Angela Merkel on Tuesday ahead of a crunch meeting of the EU27 during which they will decide whether to accept a request for a further Brexit delay until June 30.

Brexit news: Farage warned May will use the European election to pressure MPs to back her deal
But Mr Farage argued the statement from Number 10 could be part of a strategy to force MPs to back the withdrawal agreement has been trying to deliver through the Commons since November. He continued: "What she’s saying is, and this is really classic Theresa May in a sense, is we’ll start the European election campaign but if you agree to my treaty in the intervening period we won’t actually hold the poll on the day. "Is this leadership? No wonder we’re the world’s laughing stock." Brussels has offered a longer extension to Article 50 to the Prime Minister, who is set to agree to it, meaning Brexit will be delivered around Christmas and the new year period. Christopher Hope, chief political correspondent for the Daily Telegraph, said on Twitter: “LATEST rumour swirling around the House of Commons: the EU and UK could agree to a nine-month extension to #Brexit to the end to the year.”


Donald Trump is slapping huge tariffs on the EU
A European Commission source said on Tuesday the level of proposed US countermeasures was "greatly exaggerated", adding the amount of retaliation could only be determined by a World Trade Organisation arbitrator. "In the parallel Boeing dispute, the determination of EU retaliation rights is also coming closer and the EU will request the WTO-appointed arbitrator to determine the EU\'s retaliation rights," the Commission source said, adding the Commission was preparing so that it could take action after the arbitrator\'s decision. Airbus said it saw no legal basis for the US move and warned of deepening transatlantic trade tensions. The European Union is already facing US tariffs on its steel and aluminium exports and President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to hit EU cars with punitive duties.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told a conference in Paris that the two sides needed to reach a friendly agreement. "When I see the situation global growth is in, I don\'t think we can afford to have a trade conflict even if only on the specific issues of the aircraft industry in the United States and Europe," he said. The two sides are closing in on the climax of a record subsidy dispute that has been grinding its way through the WTO for almost 15 years. Both sides have won partial victories in claiming Airbus and Boeing received unlawful subsidies but disagree on the amount involved and whether each has complied with earlier WTO rulings. The US tariffs proposal put pressure on shares in European makers of aircraft and aerospace suppliers, wine, cheese and luxury goods. This morning Airbus shares were down 1.6 percent. Airbus suppliers such as Safran and Leonardo lost between 1.0 percent and 1.2 percent. MTU Aero Engines was 2.5 percent weaker and Rolls-Royce down 1.3 percent.

BBC host Martha Kearney pointed out to the Independent Group politician that MPs had rejected every proposal, apart from avoiding a no deal, in the Commons. None of the Brexit alternative amendments reached a majority in the Commons on Monday evening, prompting the Prime Minister to call a mammoth Cabinet meeting to try to find a way forward. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Ms Kearney quizzed Ms Soubry as the Independent Group voted against Ken Clarke’s proposal for a permanent customs union.
The host said: “You have had two days now of indicative votes and MPs have completely failed to unite around any kind of compromise.” The MP for Broxtowe said she did “not accept” that analysis, saying: “We have made progress in a days worth of debate than two years of this Government.” The BBC presenter Kearney snapped back: “But, all the votes have been lost haven’t they. “No single option has come forward. You have rejected everything.

“The only thing that MPs are agreeing on is that they don’t want no deal.” During the BBC interview, the Independent Group MP outlined why they did not back the customs union amendment which was rejected by a majority of three votes. Ms Soubry said: “It doesn’t deliver the regulatory alignment which is needed for the frictionless trade. “I made that very clear point to Ken last week and I made it again last night.” The Prime Minister and her senior ministers met on Tuesday morning after MPs failed to find a majority for any Brexit alternative. A call for a customs union with the EU was rejected by just three votes, while demand for a second referendum was defeated by 12 and a Norway-style deal put forward by Nick Boles by 21.


Police clashed with thousands of migrants in disturbing scenes
Greek officers fired tear gas as angry migrants hoping to make their way to northern Europe hurled stones and bottles after being barred from reaching a nearby border crossing, witnesses said. Syrian refugee Yaser said: “We don\'t want to fight with the Greek police. We want to go to Europe, we don\'t want to stay in Greece.” Wife Fatemeh, who was carrying their six-month old baby, said the family was determined to stay at the makeshift camp. She added: “We will stay here until the borders open, we don\'t have any other choice.”
Spurred by a fake rumour about border openings that had spread on social media, hundreds of migrants and refugees arrived and pitched tents on Thursday in a field next to the Diavata migrant camp near Greece\'s border with North Macedonia. In neighbouring Turkey, nearly 1,200 migrants heading toward the border with Greece following false rumours that Ankara had opened its frontier were detained on Friday, Turkish media said.There were dozens of tents in the field and riot police formed a cordon to block an access route, parking 20 buses to stop the migrants from leaving the field. Authorities also sent buses to take people back to housing settlements.
Greek officers fired tear gas as angry migrants
At midday, riot police fired teargas at dozens of people - some carrying children - who hurled stones and bottles as they tried to break through the police cordon and reach the main road leading to the border. The scuffles lasted for several hours and thick plumes of smoke rose over the fields as police fired flares to disperse the crowds and angry migrants started small fires. Jana Frey, country director for the International Rescue Committee Greece, said the unrest highlighted "the amount of false information being presented to asylum seekers and refugees."

The European Parliament’s agriculture committee voted to approve a ban on vegetarian and vegan food products carrying the same names as their meat-based alternatives. Steaks, sausages, escalope and burgers are all set for protected status after the committee voted 80 percent in favour of the changes. The decision will see meat-related terms and names “exclusively for edible parts of the animals”.
The proposal still needs to be approved by the full European Parliament after May’s Euro election, as well as the European Commission and remaining 27 member states. Eric Andrieu, the French socialist MEP tasked with overseeing the legislation, said the bizarre changes are just “common sense”. He said: “It has generated a considerable debate among the political groups and a large majority wanted to clarify things. “Particularly in the light of history, the history we share, you can have a steak or burger, you can’t call it something else.”
EU Parliament agriculture committee vote to rename veggie burgers
He added: “We felt that steak should be kept for real steak with meat and come up with a new moniker for all these products. There is a lot to be done in this front, a lot of creativity will be needed. “People need to know what they are eating. So people who want to eat less meat know what they are eating – people know what is on their plate.” The legislation will likely take years to implement, and that is if it is even considered worthwhile by the EU’s institutions. Mr Andrieu has urged Brussels to “get on with it”.
Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder suggested that the plan was just another “weird” proposal to emerge from the EU Parliament’s agriculture committee. She said: “This is just an Agricultural committee decision. They come out with a fair amount of bizarre proposals. “It’s highly unlikely this decision will pass the full Parliament.” Britain will be forced to follow EU guidelines on food labelling and safety even after Brexit.


The young Brexiteer argued remaining in the European Union - should the result of a second referendum reverse that of the 2016 vote - would have significant consequences on the country\'s status quo. Ms Westley dismissed the claim "everything will stay the same" if Brexit was revoked as she stressed the Brussels bloc would rapidly become a "superstate" under which the UK would lose its independence.
Farage has \'SURPRISE\' for Remainers – ’this is the FIGHT BACK\'
She told TalkRADIO: “This idea that somehow by staying in the EU nothing would change, it’s the status quo, the EU is moving at a very quick pace towards a centralised power.
“They’re moving towards federalisation. They want to centralise tax policies, they want to centralise all sorts of things.
“They want a European Army. It’s not the status quo.
“And so it’s really actually quite dishonest to come on the radio and say ‘oh we can just turn back the clock and remain and everything will stay the same’.
“This country will change significantly if we stay in the EU.

Iain Anderson, an expert in global political risk, said the “real story” to have emerged following the European Union’s decision to add a six-month delay to Brexit, is the bloc’s newfound willingness to reopen Brexit talks. Speaking on the BBC’s Brexicast podcast on Thursday evening, Mr Anderson said: “I think we are going into these European elections – that’s my calculation at the minute. But that this bespoke idea – it is being talked about in the UK it is clearly also being talked about in Brussels right now – frankly, we have entered a new dynamic.
The real story that has emerged is this possibility of the whole thing being opened up again Iain Anderson
“As Katya said earlier, people are sort of focussing on Macron versus Merkel, I think that’s a Government completely right. It is a total sideshow. “The real story that has just emerged in the past 20 hours or so, since the early hours of this morning, is this possibility of the whole thing being opened up again.” When asked by BBC Europe editor Katya Adler whether he was referring to both the withdrawal agreement and backstop, Mr Anderson replied: “Very possibly. Whispered tones about that starting to emerge.” But the BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming insisted “they are whispering because it is not going to happen”.
Brexit news: EU could reopen Brexit deal, says politics expert
Ms Adler continued: “I cannot imagine that EU countries would say ‘forget it, we don’t want to talk about it’.” The public affairs consultant insisted Ms Adler was “exactly right” in saying the EU could reopen talks. But she continued and said the EU will demand “realistic and workable proposals”, adding: “That’s not, for example, the Malthouse Compromise.” Mr Anderson replied: “I am getting in front of a whole bunch of folk right now and I’ve seen more movement and possibilities in the past week to ten days than I think we have seen in the last two years.” But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg insisted there is unlikely to be an agreement reached between the Tories and Labour, which would open the door to a Brexit renegotiation. Ms Kuenssberg said: “That’s really interesting because at the moment, talking to people who have been involved in the cross-party talks, I just find it really hard to see how they are ever going to get there. “Someone who has been in the talks said ‘the thing is, the more we talk, the more it reveals how big the scale of the task is’. “Because it wouldn’t just be about getting the withdrawal agreement through.”


Alastair Campbell revealed Brexit supporter Julia Hartley-Brewer was the “Leaver” former British Prime Minister Tony Blair “liked” during a radio interview. Mr Blair’s former head of communications, Mr Campbell claimed he could “destroy” Julia’s credibility by revealing the former prime minister’s admission. The Brexiteer radio host burst out laughing once hearing the remark, before pointing out one thing “in common” she shares with Mr Blair.
Mr Campbell told talkRADIO: “I have just been on the phone to the leader of the last strong and stable government that Britain had - namely Tony Blair. “I said to him, ‘Tony, I have to go because I am just about to do a radio interview’. “He said ‘who is that with’ and I said Julia Hartley-Brewer’. “Do you know what he said? Because this is going to destroy your credibility, Julia.

“He said ‘she is the Leaver I like’.” The radio host burst out laughing, before saying: “Well, I did do an event with Tony Blair some months ago, and we discovered something in his speech, we do have something in common because he is not allowed to go to Labour Party conference either.” It comes following another chaotic evening in the House of Commons after MPs voted to seek a delay to Brexit rather than risk the UK crashing out of the bloc on April 12, which was passed by 313 votes to 312. Tory Mark Francois, the MP for Rayleigh and Wickford, reacted to the Bill\'s passing with anger, calling it a "constitutional outrage" On Thursday Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will meet with the Prime Minister again to try to find a solution to the Brexit deadlock. Theresa May reached out to the opposition earlier this week after a mammoth 7-hour Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.


BBC Weather has warned of a massive cloud system sweeping across the continent keeping temperatures low this weekend. BBC Weather’s Nick Miller claimed many places across Europe do not feel like “spring has sprung” yet with “chilly” conditions present. Miller also warned of “big storms” crashing into eastern parts of Europe this weekend bringing unsettled weather.
According to the latest weather charts, the likelihood of snow falling across central Europe increases on Saturday. BBC Weather forecaster Miller said: “A flow of air coming down from the northeast with high pressure in control. “For many western areas, some decent sunshine to be had, it is still unsettled though across parts of the east of Europe with some big storms in places and a big area of cloud, where it is feeling chilly across central parts of the continent.” He added: “From Turkey across Bulgaria, Romania, into the Balkans, Greece and Italy, we are going to some downpours at times, as we look at the forecast for Friday.

“Plenty of sunshine across Iberia through the western side of France, some cloud building in the British Isles. “Notice temperatures not too special, but particularly where you have got the cloud here. Where you’re clear though, frosty nights to come, not just the next couple of nights, but also through the weekend, as well.” Moving into Saturday, the BBC Weather forecaster added: “Notice no big change in the picture for Saturday. “Still this big area of cloud still the storms the further east you are. And you go a long way south to find temperatures just into the low 20Cs.” Looking at the weather forecast into next week, Miller claimed things would “pick up” temperature wise for Paris and London.
Snow chart shows where is likely to see snowfall this weekend
According to the latest weather charts, parts of Germany are likely to see some snowfall at lower levels over the weekend. It comes as the UK is expected to be hit with wintry showers this weekend as bitterly cold conditions from Scandinavia reach the British Isles. Met Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern warned hail and sleet showers will hit East Anglia and the south-east of England on Saturday and could continue onto Sunday. McGivern said: “On Friday we still have that large area of high pressure from Scandinavia, we still have easterly air floating from the North Sea, one or two showers cropping up across eastern Britain. “Otherwise, it’s another dry and bright day. best of the sunshine to the west with 12C or 13C. 8C or 9C on that chilly North Sea coast. And you can see the extent of that chilly air floating. “These blues coming from Scandinavia. If this was the winter it would be really quite cold but it’s April so things are slowly warming up. Nevertheless, heading into the weekend we actually start to pull in even darker blues.


Italy news: Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte
The Italian Treasury will announce it expects the economy to expand by little over zero in 2019, Bloomberg reported, citing senior officials who referenced a draft report due for approval on 10 April. News of the lower growth forecast, which is down from a previous prediction for a 1 percent expansion, send the euro and Italian FTSE MIB lower. The single currency fell 0.19 percent against the US dollar to $1.1213. The euro is nearing the $1.1174 level reached on March 7, which if broken would send the currency to its weakest levels since June 2017.
As of just after 3pm UK time, the FTSE MIB is at 21,727, down 0.13 percent. Bloomberg went on to report the Italian Government is targeting a deficit of 2.3 or 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), from a projected 2.04 percent previously forecast in its controversial budget. The forecasts could still be revised before they are approved by the cabinet next week, the officials said. Il Sole 24 Ore daily reported last week how Italian finance chiefs are hopeful a planned growth boosting package may lift this estimate to 0.2 percent.
A serious recession could be very damaging for these countries David Lipton, IMF
The Italian economy has felt the brunt of a turbulent few months after plunging into recession territory following months of wrangling with the European Union (EU) over its budget. Italy fell into recession after a second consecutive quarter of decline was recorded for the last three months of 2018. The economy contracted by 0.2 percent in October to December of last year, after a decrease of 0.1 percent in July to September. Rome was warned yesterday by David Lipton, deputy director general of the International Monetary Fund, that the nation could record a new contraction for the first quarter of 2019, deepening the woes of the economy.

Theresa May is set to meet with the Labour Party leader for further Brexit talks after she reached out to Jeremy Corbyn to try to get a deal through the House of Commons. The move from the Prime Minister frustrated many Conservative MPs with some members of the Tory party’s eurosceptic European Research Group calling for Mrs May to step down. Speaking on ITV’s Peston on Wednesday evening, Brexit supporter and Conservative MP Nadine Dorries shocked Alastair Campbell by pointing out that voting for Britain to remain in the customs union would be worse than leaving the bloc.
She said: “She invited Jeremy Corbyn to Number 10 weeks ago. That’s when he walked out when he saw Chuka Umunna. “I think Parliament and Parliamentarians are letting the public down. “They voted in a referendum, they voted for Brexit. Parliamentarians are not getting behind the deal, they are not doing what they are supposed to. “Everybody is holding on to their own political ideology and not putting the country first. That is the problem.”
Brexit news: Alastair Campbell was left shaking his head during a Brexit debate
I would not vote for a customs union because we may as well stay in Nadine Dorries
She added: “If Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May between them can come up with something that is acceptable, which is Brexit, which lets us free to go onto the next stage.” ITV’s Peston interrupted the Tory MP asking whether she would accept the UK remaining in the customs union. Ms Dorries replied: “I would not vote for a customs union because we may as well stay in.” Mr Campbell threw his hands into the air before he smirked shaking his head while sitting on the panel.


Phil Hogan, the European Commission’s agriculture chief, claimed a no deal Brexit would have consequences on both sides of the Channel. The Irish eurocrat described the prospect of a hard divorce as “simply crazy” as he set out implications for no deal. He warned that there would be “significant disruption” to the agri-food market if Britain quits the EU without a deal, causing significant financial upset across the bloc.
“Despite the madness of Brexit, I still believe common sense will prevail,” he said. “No deal makes no sense, it’s simply crazy. “There’s no such thing as a good outcome in relation to Brexit, but I believe that a no-deal Brexit is the worst of all outcomes.” The largest hit will likely come to EU farmers, who currently sell more to Britain than any other country in the world. Mr Hogan said: “The EU27 and United Kingdom are very significant trading partners. The EU27 enjoys a €25 billion surplus with the UK for agri-food products, with exports of €41bn on an annual basis.
EU official Phil Hogan warns of £20 billion hit to European farmers in no-deal Brexit
“This surplus is higher than the overall EU trade surplus of €21bn with the rest of the world.” Britain could leave the EU without a deal as soon as Friday unless Theresa May can agree another Brexit delay with EU leaders this week. The European Commission has vowed to offer farmers on the Continent financial support in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Brussels-based executive has tried to shift the emphasis of hard Brexit damage onto Britain, suggesting the country’s farmers would be hit the hardest.
“One should not underestimate the importance of the EU market for the UK. given that the EU will treat the UK as any other third country, with application of tariffs and SPS checks, this presents a significant challenge for UK producers and exporters,” Mr Hogan added. Commission officials have suggested that a no-deal Brexit would likely trigger a food shortage in Britain. Sources claim that there is no “alternative ready source” for Britain to import agri-food products outside of the EU. They said: “The UK is hugely reliant on imports from the EU and for particular products, for example fruit and vegetables.


Brexit supporter Jacob Rees-Mogg has vowed to continue fighting for a true exit from the EU, even if MPs pass an amendment attached to the Prime Minister’s deal. On Monday MPs will vote again in the House of Commons on finding a path moving forward after the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal was rejected on Friday. But, the Conservative MP for North East Somerset warned about the prospect of a customs union amendment being passed by the Commons - which could destroy any chance of the UK striking post-Brexit trade deals with countries around the world.
Speaking on LBC, Mr Rees-Mogg said: “I am against the customs union option, because, you have got to remember the history of the European Union. “The customs union is the cornerstone of the European Union. It was why we joined in the early 1970s to join in this trading bloc which protected itself from the rest of the world. “That was under very different trading conditions when you needed to be in trading blocs. “That’s changed. If we are in the customs union we will not be able to do deals with other countries. We won’t get the benefits of cheaper food, clothing and footwear. We will still be tied into the high cost, inefficient, anti-consumer EU. So a customs union is a bad outcome.”
Brexit news: Jacob Rees-Mogg warned Theresa May could adopt the customs union amendment
My concern is the Prime Minister is more concerned to avoid a no deal Brexit than anything Jacob Rees-Mogg
He added: “I wouldn’t accept it. The problem is if we don’t leave the European Union properly, people like me will carry on campaigning for us to leave properly just at a different date. “My concern is the Prime Minister is more concerned to avoid a no deal Brexit than anything, therefore I am very concerned she could decide to go for a customs union tacked onto her deal. “If that happens people like me will continue campaigning to get out of this customs union.” Mr Rees-Mogg also said Friday\'s vote on the Brexit deal would "probably have gone through" if it has been Mrs May\'s deal versus a general election. The Prime Minister’s Brexit withdrawal agreement was defeated on Friday afternoon by MPs in the House of Commons by 344 votes to 286.


Speaking to Euronet, the Commission chief claimed he was working "persistently" to avoid a hard Brexit outcome with the UK but blasted Theresa May\'s Government over its failure to provide clarity during the negotiations. President Juncker branded Britons\' decision to leave the European Union a "bad decision" and argued the Conservative Prime Minister has failed to put her country\'s interests before her party.
He said: “I am working - I would not say every single minute because it would be ridiculous - but I am working persistently to avoid a hard Brexit. “If we compare the British Parliament with an Egyptian Sphinx, the Sphinx is an open book. “We do not know where the UK wants to head to. “We are not in a spirit of revenge towards the UK, after the sovereign decision of leaving the EU by the British people.

“A really bad decision, but the decision of the British people. “If I say today who is to be blamed, would that allow us to be closer to a deal? No. “But it is true that the Conservative Government in the UK had in its mind the interests of the party before those of the country." It comes as MPs rejected Theresa May\'s deal for the third time last week as well as voting down all other alternatives to the deal put forward by various members of the House in a series of indicative votes. After a long meeting with her Cabinet on Tuesday, the Prime Minister announced her invitation to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to reach a cross-party solution to the Brexit impasse.


Leader of Angela Merkel’s German Christian Democratic Union party, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, has suggested Ireland are to blame for the Brexit stalemate. Speaking with BBC’s Katya Adler, the Europe Editor asked whether Germany might have been willing to add an end date to the controversial backstop mechanism within the withdrawal agreement. BBC’s Adler said: “Isn’t it foolhardy to stay on these very tough red lines in negotiations such as when it came to the famous Irish backstop, that guarantees to keep the Irish border open.
“Wouldn’t it have been more sensible to say ‘yes okay we will put an end date on the backstop’, or ‘we will put it far enough in the future really we don’t think it will be realistic it will ever get to that’. “I have heard internally Germany might have been open to that idea, but there was push back from other member states, particularly Ireland, is that correct?” Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer said: “It was clear from the start that all EU countries wanted to work together. “Particularly listening to the point of view of Ireland and the Irish Government to try to avoid no deal.

It was clear from the start that all EU countries wanted to work together Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer
“But, if the UK now came to us and said ‘let’s spend five-days negotiating non-stop on how to avoid the backstop’, I can’t imagine anyone in Europe saying no. “If there were new watertight proposals for the border, I don’t think anyone in the EU would say we don’t want to talk about it.” Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer added that she likes to think another Brexit referendum “might be possible” but said it “had to be acceptable to the people of the UK”. Members of the Conservative Party’s eurosceptic European Research Group were deeply critical of the backstop element of the withdrawal agreement and it was one of the crucial reasons many of them could not back Mrs May’s agreement. This week the Prime Minister has been meeting with the Labour Party leader after Theresa May reached out to Jeremy Corbyn to help try and get Britain’s exit from the EU over the line.
The move from the Prime Minister enraged a number of Conservative Party colleagues with some in the Tory party’s European Research Group calling for Mrs May to step down. On Friday, Mrs May wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to Article 50 until June 30. The Prime Minister said she will seek to ratify her withdrawal agreement before the European Parliament elections on May 23, but will make "responsible preparations" to take part if that does not prove possible. In her letter, she wrote: "I am writing, therefore, to inform the European Council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty. "The United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June 2019. If the parties are able to ratify before this date, the Government proposes that the period should be terminated early.


A BBC Question Time audience member snapped at the Remain backing MP claiming a second Brexit vote would be “undemocratic”. Mr Lammy has repeatedly demanded a People’s Vote and delivered a speech at last months anti-Brexit march. Speaking on Question Time, the audience member claimed the UK would be playing a “dangerous game” if it advocated another referendum.
The Question Time audience member said: “Let’s put Brexit aside for one moment. A lot of things that have been said on the panel are sounding slightly undemocratic. “We have had the largest turn out ever in British politics where 17.4million people voted to the simple question of ‘Remain in the EU’ or ‘Leave in the EU’. “The dangerous game we are playing here is you are going against the will of the people and to even mention a second referendum Mr Lammy is just undemocratic.” The Labour MP for Tottenham tried interrupting as he shouted out, “no it’s not”.

The BBC Question Time audience member replied: “Hold on. Hear me out. Hear me out. “If we go to the next election and we are not too happy with the result because Labour got in or another party got in, what do we do? “Oh, ‘let’s put it back to the people’, I am not happy. Best out of three, best out of five, best out of ten.” He added: “Before we had democracy, does anyone recall the system we had before democracy? It was violence.
“The majority rule came in, you accept what the majority say because otherwise, people won’t follow any rules.” This week the Prime Minister has been meeting with the Labour Party leader after Theresa May reached out to Jeremy Corbyn to help try and get Britain’s exit from the EU over the line. The move from the Prime Minister enraged a number of Conservative Party colleagues with some in the Tory party’s European Research Group calling for Mrs May to step down. Discussions around a second Brexit vote have taken place, and Ministers have considered the possibility of giving MPs a vote on holding a referendum on a deal as part of the talks with Labour, the Daily Telegraph reported.


The Government announced on Monday they have launched preparations to hold European elections in the United Kingdom should Britain be stuck into a long Brexit extension. A note from a Cabinet Office spokesman suggested the UK would however not be bound to take part in the vote if a deal were to be struck with the European Union before May 22, a day before the expected start of the vote. Nigel Farage suggested the announcement indicates Britain will effectively take part in the vote unless MPs agree to pass through Parliament Theresa May\'s proposed Brexit deal.
Responding to the note on his daily LBC show, Mr Farage said: "Folks, we are having European elections, we are having European elections. "She’ll go to the summit, she’ll beg in Berlin first, she’ll beg in Paris later on, she will then go on to prostrate herself in front of 27 other European leaders and, of course, the big boys like Barnier and Tusk and Juncker. "On Thursday, the legislation will be moved and the nomination for candidates will open this Friday. That’s pretty certain." Theresa May is expected to meet with German leader Angela Merkel on Tuesday ahead of a crunch meeting of the EU27 during which they will decide whether to accept a request for a further Brexit delay until June 30.

Brexit news: Farage warned May will use the European election to pressure MPs to back her deal
But Mr Farage argued the statement from Number 10 could be part of a strategy to force MPs to back the withdrawal agreement has been trying to deliver through the Commons since November. He continued: "What she’s saying is, and this is really classic Theresa May in a sense, is we’ll start the European election campaign but if you agree to my treaty in the intervening period we won’t actually hold the poll on the day. "Is this leadership? No wonder we’re the world’s laughing stock." Brussels has offered a longer extension to Article 50 to the Prime Minister, who is set to agree to it, meaning Brexit will be delivered around Christmas and the new year period. Christopher Hope, chief political correspondent for the Daily Telegraph, said on Twitter: “LATEST rumour swirling around the House of Commons: the EU and UK could agree to a nine-month extension to #Brexit to the end to the year.”


Theresa May met with Jeremy Corbyn last week after the Prime Minister reached out to the Labour Party leader to try to deliver Brexit. Mrs May has warned that no Brexit at all remains a possibility and claimed she has done “everything in my power” to persuade Tory MPs and DUP MPs to back her withdrawal agreement, which has been rejected three times. Leading Brexit supporter and Conservative MP for North East Somerset, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has claimed the Prime Minister only has herself to blame for not delivering Brexit.
Jacob Rees-Mogg told Sophy Ridge: “I would question the failure to get enough support for no deal. You are quite right, Parliament has passed motions objecting to a no deal Brexit. “But, it passed two laws which provided for us to leave on March 29 which was subsequently delayed. Law trumps motions and the Prime Minister could have taken us out on March 29, it was the Prime Minister who asked for an extension. “It was the Prime Minister who changed the date by prerogative power from March 29 to April 12. This all rests with her and on her shoulders. “She has made, the Prime Minister Mrs May has made active choices to stop us leaving and she deserves to be held to account for that, because people ought to know the truth of the position, rather than trying to blame everybody else.”

Mrs May has made active choices to stop us leaving and she deserves to be held to account for that Jacob Rees-Mogg
He added: “If the Prime Minister had done what she said in the first place and stuck to the law as set out in two acts we would have left the European Union by now.” The Prime Minister said she had done "everything in my power" to persuade Tory and DUP MPs to back her deal but acknowledged the withdrawal agreement had been rejected by the Commons three times and "there is no sign it can be passed in the near future". She said: ”Because Parliament has made clear it will stop the UK leaving without a deal, we now have a stark choice: leave the European Union with a deal or do not leave at all. "My answer to that is clear: we must deliver Brexit and to do so we must agree a deal. If we cannot secure a majority among Conservative and DUP MPs we have no choice but to reach out across the House of Commons.
"The referendum was not fought along party lines and people I speak to on the doorstep tell me they expect their politicians to work together when the national interest demands it. "The fact is that on Brexit there are areas where the two main parties agree: we both want to end free movement, we both want to leave with a good deal, and we both want to protect jobs. "That is the basis for a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament and winning that majority is the only way to deliver Brexit." On Friday, Mrs May wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to the Article 50 process until June 30.


The EU official will “take stock of the developments in London” during several meetings in Dublin. He will also meet with Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, and finance minister Paschal Donohue. Britain could leave the EU without a deal as early as Friday if leaders fail to agree another Brexit extension when they meet on Wednesday.
The meetings will focus on preparations for emergency European Council summit and no deal plans for the Irish border, according to a European Commission spokesman. They said: “This is part of his frequent visits to the 27 capitals, ahead of the European Council, of course. “This visit reflect the ongoing and intensive discussions on the planning of no-deal scenarios, and he’s accompanied by Commission officials to cover all of the Article 50 state of play.” Ahead of Mr Barnier’s Dublin trip, Mr Coveney said the visit represents the Commission and EU’s ongoing show of “solidarity” with Ireland.
Michel Barnier to hold no-deal Brexit talks with Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar today
Mr Coveney said: “What he will want to do first of all is show solidarity with Ireland. “But also I think he’ll want a detailed conversation in terms of Ireland’s perspective on the most recent ask from the prime minister for an extension of time. “Ireland is, of course, willing to give the process more time, but we, like many other EU member states, will want to see a plan to go with that to show that there is a proposed way of finding a majority of support in Westminster for a way forward.” Mr Varadkar and Mr Barnier are expected to host a joint press event after their meeting this afternoon.
Theresa May last week requested to delay Brexit until June 30 in order to give her more time to win the support of MPs for her deal. Mr Coveney said he could support a short or long extension, he said: ‘We’re open to either in truth. “As long as there is a credible plan to get a deal across the line, then I think European leaders will look at an extension positively. “But they will need to see a credible plan to go with the ask.” Mrs May will also hold her own pre-summit meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday.
Over the weekend, Mr Varadkar attempted to address the possibility of France vetoing another extension of the EU’s Article 50 exit clause. The Irish leader said he does not believe another member state would veto the delay as “they would never be forgiven”. Luxembourg’s foreign minister Jean Asselborn suggested the Prime Minister was to blame for the impending no-deal Brexit. He told reporters: “The British hard turned a deal into a no deal. And now they want to turn the no deal into a deal.


Iain Anderson, an expert in global political risk, said the “real story” to have emerged following the European Union’s decision to add a six-month delay to Brexit, is the bloc’s newfound willingness to reopen Brexit talks. Speaking on the BBC’s Brexicast podcast on Thursday evening, Mr Anderson said: “I think we are going into these European elections – that’s my calculation at the minute. But that this bespoke idea – it is being talked about in the UK it is clearly also being talked about in Brussels right now – frankly, we have entered a new dynamic.
The real story that has emerged is this possibility of the whole thing being opened up again Iain Anderson
“As Katya said earlier, people are sort of focussing on Macron versus Merkel, I think that’s a Government completely right. It is a total sideshow. “The real story that has just emerged in the past 20 hours or so, since the early hours of this morning, is this possibility of the whole thing being opened up again.” When asked by BBC Europe editor Katya Adler whether he was referring to both the withdrawal agreement and backstop, Mr Anderson replied: “Very possibly. Whispered tones about that starting to emerge.” But the BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming insisted “they are whispering because it is not going to happen”.
Brexit news: EU could reopen Brexit deal, says politics expert
Ms Adler continued: “I cannot imagine that EU countries would say ‘forget it, we don’t want to talk about it’.” The public affairs consultant insisted Ms Adler was “exactly right” in saying the EU could reopen talks. But she continued and said the EU will demand “realistic and workable proposals”, adding: “That’s not, for example, the Malthouse Compromise.” Mr Anderson replied: “I am getting in front of a whole bunch of folk right now and I’ve seen more movement and possibilities in the past week to ten days than I think we have seen in the last two years.” But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg insisted there is unlikely to be an agreement reached between the Tories and Labour, which would open the door to a Brexit renegotiation. Ms Kuenssberg said: “That’s really interesting because at the moment, talking to people who have been involved in the cross-party talks, I just find it really hard to see how they are ever going to get there. “Someone who has been in the talks said ‘the thing is, the more we talk, the more it reveals how big the scale of the task is’. “Because it wouldn’t just be about getting the withdrawal agreement through.”


Speaking from Downing Street, Mrs May suggested she would make any further Brexit delay “as short as possible”. But her request, which contains little detail, is likely to infuriate EU leaders ahead of an emergency summit in Brussels next week. Responding, Mr Tusk promised to listen to the Prime Minister’s latest plan and urged European colleagues to do the same.
The European Council president said: “Even if, after today, we don’t know what the end result will be, let us be patient.” Mrs May vowed not to hold European Parliament elections in the UK in her address to the nation. Mrs May said: "I have always been clear that we could make a success of no deal in the long term but leaving with a deal is the best solution. "So we will need a further extension of Article 50 – one that is as short as possible and which ends when we pass a deal.
EU set to reject Theresa May Brexit delay unless UK holds EU Parliament elections
"And we need to be clear what such an extension is for – to ensure we leave in a timely and orderly way. "This debate, this division, cannot drag on much longer." This will limit any extension until May 22, which is the day before Britain would have to participate in the euro ballot. An EU diplomat told Express.co.uk: "There must be European Parliament elections in the UK. May will need to produce a good reason to convince leaders of a short extension. It\'s not very likely."


After hours of intense debate, EU leaders agreed Brexit will now be delayed until October 31 with a review to happen at the June 21 European Council summit. Following the talks, Czech prime minister Andrej Babiš outlined his wish to stop Brexit on BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme. Mr Babiš said: “Me, personally, I hope you will stay in the EU finally. Maybe we will have elections and a second referendum, I don’t know.
I hope you will stay in the EU finally
“It’s my own personal wish. It’s very negative for the EU that you are leaving.”
BBC host Nick Robinson asked the Czech prime minister whether he hopes the British people will change their minds on Brexit.
In response, Mr Babiš chuckled and said: “You have to think I have a clear position. The British people have to think about the future of your country.”
The Brexit delay will still see Britain forced to hold European Parliament elections on May 23 as one of the guarantees demanded by Brussels.
Britain will be expected to leave the bloc by June 1 if the country fails to participate in the EU elections.
Prime Minister of Slovakia Peter Pellegrini has also said the extension would allow Britain to have a second referendum.
Mr Pellegrini said: “I think now we gave Great Britain a chance and enough time to make some final decision and to say to citizens in the United Kingdom and also in the whole of Europe, ‘what is the future of our future relationship?’”


BBC Weather forecaster Ben Rich warned of unsettled weather across Europe as a brutal weather system heads towards the continent. Mr Rich said: “There’s a lot of rain to come here over the next few days. Also, bands of wet weather sliding out of Spain and Portugal and into southern France. We will once again see some snowfall over the Alps. We have had a lot of snow here over recent days so there is the potential for avalanches.”

Turkey and Italy are set to remain dry while Greece suffers from heavy rain on Saturday. But the BBC forecaster warned a band of rain will then move in across southern France, adding: “A lot of heavy showers across Spain and Portugal where it will also be very windy, particularly gusty conditions close to the coast. “But amidst all of that there is some fine weather to be had. Germany for the most part seeing sunshine. “Temperatures in Berlin up to 21C – not bad at all for this time of year. It stays fine here as we go on into Sunday.
BBC Weather warns of avalanche risk in the Alps over the weekend
“You’ll see some further snowfall across the Alps. Although, generally, this frontal system weakening as it drifts its way northwards. Still, some outbreaks of showery rain into southern Italy and across the south east of Europe. “Some rain, sleet and snow affecting parts of Sweden over the next few days. It should dry up in Stockholm as we get into Tuesday and Wednesday but it will turn an awful lot colder. “Equally, in Moscow it will turn showery but mild over the next five days. “The weather gradually improves in Athens.”


The furious Brexiteer demanded the European Union show “mutual respect” as he warned the British people are growing “increasingly angry” at the lack of Brexit progress. During a passionate speech at a Bruges Group event on Tuesday, Mr Francois said: “We are generally slow to anger. Not for us, the donning of yellow jackets and setting fire to Oxford Street.
UK must \'look beyond EU\' for trade growth – \'world going GANGBUSTERS\'
Brexit has already gone on long enough
“But nevertheless, we do, in our very British way, have a strong sense of fair play and what is and isn’t right.
“And I believe that the British people are growing increasingly angry at attempts by some of their own Government, in cahoots with those in Parliament and the European Union, to essentially keep us in against our will.”
The Brexiteer MP reiterated that Britain voted to Leave in the 2016 referendum, adding: “Let’s just do it.”
Mr Francois concluded the speech with a stern message to the EU and said: “My earnest message to the European Council is simple. Brexit has already gone on long enough.


Brexit supporter and Conservative MP for Rayleigh and Wickford, Mark Francois, demanded Theresa May “resign” when asked what the Prime Minister should do next. Mr Francois also insisted the UK should still leave the Brussels bloc on April 12 at 11pm. When asked about who should replace the Prime Minister, Mr Francois told Express.co.uk: “I am not particularly fussed about that.
“All I am concerned with is that we leave the European Union and honour the promise we made to 17.4million people. “They are getting angrier and angrier out there because they can see what a stitch up this all is. “I think, if we were to fight European elections, we are not going to do very well. Nigel Farage is licking his lips, isn’t he? “The way through all this is that we don’t ask for an extension of any length.

“We just leave the European Union at 11pm on Friday, 12 April.” Last Friday the Prime Minister wrote to the President of the European Council asking for an extension to the Article 50 process until June 30. European Council president Donald Tusk warned, "neither side should be allowed to feel humiliated at any stage in this difficult process". Mr Tusk originally called for a "flexible extension" lasting "as long as necessary and no longer than one year".
On Tuesday the Prime Minister met with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss a Brexit extension. The unanimous agreement of all 27 EU states is needed to avoid a no deal Brexit on at 11pm on Friday. Arriving at the EU summit on Wednesday, the Prime Minister was asked if she was "embarrassed" about asking for an extension. Mrs May said: “I know many people will be frustrated that the summit is taking place at all because the UK should have left the EU by now.


After a mammoth Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Prime Minister Theresa May spoke directly to the country where she reached out to the Labour Party leader to try to deliver Brexit. But, the decision by the Prime Minister has sparked fury among some Brexit supporters within her own party, with some members of the Conservative’s European Research Group calling for her to step down. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay was accused of “handing the keys to Corbyn” with many describing the decision by Mrs May as a “betrayal”.
Host, Nick Robinson said: “What do you say to many Conservatives, some Members of Parliament, many activists, who say to you a Leaver, appointed to the Cabinet, and you know the words they use, they use words like a coup, they use words like treason. They use words like traitor. “They think you are betraying the 17million who voted to Leave by handing the keys to Brexit to a man they loathe and don’t trust.” Mr Barclay replied: “Well, firstly, I think those sort of emotive words are not helpful given some of the things we have seen around the debate. “But, I would use one word back, which is numbers. The reality is that the House of Commons has not voted for any of the options.

“Many of us on the Brexiteer wing have been saying that if you don’t support the Prime Minister’s deal, then the risk was a softer Brexit. “It’s regrettable that what we have been saying for several months is coming to pass, but that is the remorseless logic of not backing the Prime Minister’s deal.” He also said: “The Prime Minister\'s deal won\'t go through and no deal in law is taken off the table, then the consequence of that is either a soft Brexit or no Brexit at all." Speaking to the country on Tuesday evening, the Prime Minister said that she should reach out to Mr Corbyn to try to deliver Brexit.
Mrs May said: “The ideal outcome of this process would be to agree on an approach on a future relationship that delivers on the result of the referendum, that both the leader of the Opposition and I could put to the House for approval and which I could then take to next week\'s European Council. "However, if we cannot agree on the single unified approach, then we would instead agree on a number of options for the future relationship that we could put to the House in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue. "Crucially, the Government stands ready to abide by the decision of the House. But to make this process work, the opposition would need to agree to this too." In response, Mr Corbyn said he would not set any "limits" ahead of the meeting with the Prime Minister, but that his principles ahead of it were to recognise the "needs of the people that elected all MPs to Parliament and the need to avoid the dangers of crashing out".


Theresa May said from Downing Street on Tuesday she will have to ask the European Union for a short extension to the Article 50 process as she attempts to break the Brexit deadlock by reaching out to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Hosting his LBC show, Nigel Farage reacted to the comments and said the statement simply prolongs the Brexit impasse. Mr Farage warned: “That was the Prime Minister basically saying we need national unity to deliver the national interest. Prime Minister, I would respond by saying we need leadership.
We may stay part of the customs union forever Nigel Farage
“My view is what we got from that statement was yet more fudge. “So, basically whatever happens in the future depends on Labour to a very large extent, the House of Commons has to agree, we must pass the withdrawal agreement, it must all be done by the 22nd May because otherwise people like that nasty Farage might stand in the European elections. “And I am basically going to accept that in the future political declaration we may stay part of the customs union forever. “My take on that is that that statement from the Prime Minister probably takes us no further forward whatsoever and maybe leads us even deeper into crisis because it’s all dependent upon her withdrawal treaty with amended, as it seems to me, political declarations passing and it may have taken us no further forward at all.”
Brexit news: Nigel Farage said Theresa May is leading Britain "into crisis"
In a statement from Downing Street following a marathon Cabinet meeting in Westminster today, the Prime Minister said she will meet with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to try and come up with a plan they can both agree on. Theresa May said in a statement from Downing Street that the UK could make a "success" of a no deal Brexit but insisted leaving with the EU is still the "best solution". She added the extension to Article 50 should be "as short as possible". Mrs May said: "I have always been clear that we could make a success of no-deal in the long term but leaving with a deal is the best solution. "So we will need a further extension of Article 50 - one that is as short as possible and which ends when we pass a deal.

A tiny number of accounts backing anti-EU parties such as Spanish right-wingers Vox and Alternative for Germany make up the majority of Twitter, Facebook and YouTube posts. While less than 0.1 percent of social media users across Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Poland actually support a populist party, around 10 percent of online content relating to the euro ballot backed eurosceptics. Research firm Alto Data Analytics analysed the top 200 keywords and found the five most popular focused on key eurosceptic and populist campaign efforts.
Immigration, European asylum policy, Islam and European election made up over half the output of the social media content analysed. In Germany, Alto’s data shows from December 15, 2018, to March 15, 2019, that 31.6 percent of mentions refer to the AfD and its associated politicians. Angela Merkel’s CDU fell drastically behind with only 22.9 percent of the political social media posts focused on the government. Facebook and YouTube are the most popular platforms with AfD-related posts and Kremlin-backed Russia Today and Sputnik are most likely destinations.
Eurosceptic presence on social media trumps pro-EU accounts
Ben Nimmo, a senior research fellow at the Atlantic Council, told Politico: “To get a relatively small group generating such a large percentage of content is emblematic of fringe parties. “The goal is to break out of their echo chambers and research other people.” Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg last week shared a video of Alice Weidel, the AfD\'s parliamentary leader, on a YouTube page focused on anti-EU and right-wing views. Ahead of the EU elections, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg refused to guarantee his platform cutting out all interference in the ballot. He said: “We’ve certainly made a lot of progress. But no, I don’t think anyone can guarantee in a world where you have nation states that are trying to interfere in elections, there’s no single thing we can do and say okay we’ve now solved the issue.


A BBC Question Time audience member snapped at the Remain backing MP claiming a second Brexit vote would be “undemocratic”. Mr Lammy has repeatedly demanded a People’s Vote and delivered a speech at last months anti-Brexit march. Speaking on Question Time, the audience member claimed the UK would be playing a “dangerous game” if it advocated another referendum.
The Question Time audience member said: “Let’s put Brexit aside for one moment. A lot of things that have been said on the panel are sounding slightly undemocratic. “We have had the largest turn out ever in British politics where 17.4million people voted to the simple question of ‘Remain in the EU’ or ‘Leave in the EU’. “The dangerous game we are playing here is you are going against the will of the people and to even mention a second referendum Mr Lammy is just undemocratic.” The Labour MP for Tottenham tried interrupting as he shouted out, “no it’s not”.

The BBC Question Time audience member replied: “Hold on. Hear me out. Hear me out. “If we go to the next election and we are not too happy with the result because Labour got in or another party got in, what do we do? “Oh, ‘let’s put it back to the people’, I am not happy. Best out of three, best out of five, best out of ten.” He added: “Before we had democracy, does anyone recall the system we had before democracy? It was violence.
“The majority rule came in, you accept what the majority say because otherwise, people won’t follow any rules.” This week the Prime Minister has been meeting with the Labour Party leader after Theresa May reached out to Jeremy Corbyn to help try and get Britain’s exit from the EU over the line. The move from the Prime Minister enraged a number of Conservative Party colleagues with some in the Tory party’s European Research Group calling for Mrs May to step down. Discussions around a second Brexit vote have taken place, and Ministers have considered the possibility of giving MPs a vote on holding a referendum on a deal as part of the talks with Labour, the Daily Telegraph reported.


Conservative Party MP Steve Baker has warned that he may vote with the Labour Party in a confidence motion in the Government if the Prime Minister was to accept Britain staying in the customs union. MPs are set to vote on potential future steps of the Brexit process on Monday after the Prime Minister’s withdrawal agreement was voted down last week. One of the indicative votes includes the possibility of the UK staying in the customs union, with the original proposal only losing by six votes last Wednesday.
Speaking on Politics Live, BBC presenter Jo Coburn said: “If Theresa May does that if she bolts on a customs union, would you vote against her Government in a no-confidence motion?” Deputy Chair of the Conservative Party\'s eurosceptic European Research Group, Mr Baker, said he was “hoping not to reach that point” and would “expect to always vote with the Government in a confidence motion.” The BBC host continued: “You said that the party would be shattered. If in the end, she does what you absolutely verdantly oppose, would you, at that 11th hour, if Labour brings forward a no-confidence motion, vote for it?” Mr Baker replied: “Look, at this point, I can foresee no circumstances while as a Conservative MP I voted against the Government in a confidence motion.

“But, we are approaching the point where the stakes are now so very high and so transcend party politics and what this country is about, and the fundamental British value, that political power rests on consent, that I think these things are coming onto the table.” When pressed, Mr Baker added: “It’s on the table.” It comes after the Brexiteer wrote a threat on Twitter showing how much his side had already compromised since the historic 2016 EU referendum. He wrote: "1. We are still in the EU nearly 3 years after the Referendum. We accepted the Art 50 route. We then accepted another 18 months of the implementation period.
"2. We accepted ECJ jurisdiction over the agreement including over how much we pay and EU citizens rights. "3. We accepted £39bn as a price to get to trade talks. "4. We found we had to accept the Number 10 negotiating team negotiating in secrecy. "5. UK fish were to be treated as outside of the single customs territory for trade purposes as a prelude to fishing rights for trade deal. "6. This was always a bad deal. We compromised and compromised but we were not prepared to accept the threat to our constitution and democracy resulting from the Northern Irish backstop and the acceptance of EU laws over which we would have no say."


Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, threw out plans to make it easier for Britain to maintain an open border in a pledge to instead protect the single market. After crunch talks with the European Commission, Dublin rejected the possibility of customs checks being undertaken away from the border in the event of no deal. Britain has vowed to ensure no hardening of the Irish border but Brussels and Dublin are yet to reveal their own concrete plans.
Mr Coveney told a parliamentary debate: “We have to find a way of ensuring that we protect the single market\'s integrity and that we avoid physical infrastructure on the Irish border. “Ireland is not going to allow a situation where the UK leaving the European Union without a deal drags Ireland out of the single market with it. “What I mean by that is checks in EU ports on all Irish products, that is not a runner and would cause significant damage to our economy so we will not allow it." Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar has met with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in Paris ahead of the emergency Brexit summit.
Ireland mounts pressure on Theresa May to implement backstop in event of no-deal Brexit
Mr Varadkar warned: “As things stand the UK will leave the EU on April 12 without a deal. “However there is still time for the Prime Minister to come to the European Council with proposals that are credible and have a clear pathway to success and I think we need to be open to any proposals that she may bring forward to us.” Privately, Paris has warned Dublin that border checks will have to be implemented in the event of no deal in order to protect the EU’s single market. But no concrete plans have emerged despite months of negotiating hard Brexit contingency plans.
An EU diplomat said: “The EU, according to WTO rules, is forced to protect its custom borders.” Previously EU officials have pondered plans that could see customs checks carried out away from the border to prevent infrastructure being reintroduced. Another plot being worked up in Brussels would see Britain forced to implement the hated Irish backstop, guarantee citizens’ rights and pay its £39billion Brexit bill as the price to return to negotiations after a no-deal divorce. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, told a Brussels audience: “So we have to find operational solutions. The two parameters are number one, the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions, number two for us the respect for the integrity of the single market.


Jacob Rees-Mogg was quizzed on BBC’s Today programme about retweeting a video of German AfD co-leader Alice Weidel speaking in Germany’s parliament about Brexit. The far-right AfD is Germany’s main opposition party and has campaigned for tougher immigration controls. In response, Jacob Rees-Mogg claimed it was “typical” of the Today programme to ask him about the tweet as he brought up BBC radio presenter James Naughtie who apologised after comparing the European Research Group to France’s National Front.
Speaking on Today, BBC’s Mishal Husain said: “I want to ask you about what you did the other day in retweeting and drawing attention to something which the AfD put out. “I know you have been asked about this quite a few times. And you have said so far that you don’t agree with everything that they stand for but you wanted to draw attention to this. “You have nevertheless chosen to shine a spotlight on a party whose core principles are anti-immigration and anti-Islam, whose leader in the German Parliament views include Germany being overrun by Arabs and Roma. “Is there nothing in that which gives you pause for thought, that at least you should clarify when you put out and say that you don’t support their other beliefs?”
BBC\'s Mishal Husain clashed with Jacob Rees-Mogg on Today
Mr Rees-Mogg replied: “Well, I think this is typical of the BBC’s obsession, dare I say it, the Today programme’s obsession about this. “Mr Naughtie quite shamefully said the other week that the ERG was like the National Front in France. He said it himself, it was his view. He is a BBC person, he is paid by the license fee.” The BBC presenter stepped in demanding Mr Rees-Mogg answer the question, enraging the Conservative Party Brexiteer. The Tory MP said: “I am coming to the question. You must be patient and not interrupt so much because the answer needs to be given properly. “The BBC does have this obsession. What Mr Naughtie said was an outrageous slur and he wasn’t challenged by whoever was interviewing him. That wasn’t raised.”
That to me seems typical of the Today programme’s leftie approach Jacob Rees-Mogg
Ms Husain claimed the remark from Mr Naughtie was not “his view”, before Mr Rees-Mogg added: “Well it was a view he expressed. “When Mr Naughtie quotes someone, and it is not his view, that’s fine. When I quote somebody and it is not my view, that’s a great shock. “That to me seems typical of the Today programme’s leftie approach. An obsession with this issue.” Mr Rees-Mogg posted a video on Sunday of the German AfD co-leader Alice Weidel speaking in Germany\'s parliament. Alongside the video, the Tory MP wrote: "The AfD leader asks \'Is it any wonder the British see bad faith behind every manoeuvre from Brussels?\'"
Labour MP for Tottenham David Lammy responded to the Tweet, claiming Mr Rees-Mogg was “promoting Germany\'s overtly racist party, AfD". He wrote: “Jacob Rees-Mogg promoting Germany\'s overtly racist party, AfD. Our country\'s proudest moment was defeating the far-right. Now we are supposed to sit back while xenophobes, nativists, nationalists & isolationists do their best to tear Europe apart again. We must not let them win.” Speaking on LBC on Monday, Rees-Mogg said: “I\'m not supporting the AfD. But this is a speech in the Bundestag of real importance because it shows a German view of Brexit.” In March, BBC host James Naughtie sparked fury and apologised after likening members of the ERG to France’s National Front.


Prime Minister Theresa May travelled to Brussels on Wednesday to meet with EU leaders after she requested an extension to Britain’s departure from the Brussels bloc. Mrs May was filmed joking with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and president of the European Council Donald Tusk just moments before delivering a Brexit speech to her EU counterparts. In the footage, the Prime Minister and Mrs Merkel both begin laughing at something on a tablet.
The pair then share the joke with EU officials and then the president of the European Council, before Mr Tusk is seen bursting out with laughter. BBC’s Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg tweeted: “IPAD NEWS! the gag was apparently a side by side pic of May and Merkel taking questions in their own parliaments this afternoon, wearing the same colour of jacket..... #brexitbantz, kind of”. As she arrived at the EU summit, Mrs May was asked if she was “embarrassed” about having to ask for an extension. The Prime Minister said: “I know many people will be frustrated that the summit is taking place at all because the UK should have left the EU by now.

The purpose of this summit is to agree an extension which gives us more time to agree to a deal Theresa May
“I greatly regret the fact that Parliament has not been able to pass a deal that would enable us to leave in a smooth and orderly way.” She added: “But, I and the Government continue to work to find a way forward. We have been talking with the opposition and there has been serious constructive talks. They will continue tomorrow. “The purpose of this summit is to agree to an extension which gives us more time to agree to a deal to enable us to leave the EU in that smooth and orderly way. “What matters I think is that I have asked for an extension to June 30, but what is important is that any extension enables us to leave at the point of which we ratify the withdrawal agreement. So we could leave on the 22 May and start to build our brighter future.”
Speaking in Brussels, EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that any extension to the Article 50 process “must serve a purpose”. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte opened up on the division among the EU27 over the length of any extension. He told reporters: “It is very well possible that we will decide to prevent a no deal Brexit tonight. "We will have several important discussions, on how long will an extension be and what conditions will be attached to it.


The President of the European Commission almost set the Rwandan First Lady on fire during a ceremony to commemorate genocide. Shocking footage captured the horror moment Jean-Claude Juncker swung around and nearly hit the Rwandan First Lady with a flame-lit torch. In the video, the European Commission President, 64, lit the Flame of Remembrance before he appeared to try to hand the flaming torch to an official.
But, as he swiftly turned around, Mr Juncker came dangerously close to hitting Jeannette Kagame, wife of Rwandan president Paul. Mr and Mrs Kagame appeared to flinch and dodged backwards as the burning torch came just inches away from hitting them. An official quickly stepped in to ensure the European Commission President did not harm anyone with the large flame. After attending the event, the President of the European Commission wrote on Twitter: “I am moved beyond words at this memorial to tragedy.
Jean-Claude Juncker appeared to almost set the Rwandan First Lady on fire
“It serves as a bleak warning of the worst humanity is capable of. “But through the darkest of days, I remain in awe at the power of regeneration, of this country, and of humankind #Kwibuka25.” The ceremony, which took place on Sunday, started with the flame-lighting memorial, with the fire set to burn for 100 days. President Paul Kagame began a week of solemn ceremonies on Sunday to commemorate the lives of 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutus murdered during the Rwandan genocide, a three-month-killing spree that began 25 years ago.

The Labour Party have whipped MPs to betray the 2017 Labour Party manifesto, which stated the party would have ended the freedom of movement with Brexit . Speaking on his LBC show, Mr Farage ridiculed the decision and said: “I’m getting a reaction from LBC listeners on Facebook. Theresa says she used to be Labour and will never vote again. James says ‘all my family aren’t voting Labour’. Mark says ‘Labour are sell-outs’. Pete says ‘Labour, never again’.
Brexit could happen \'within DAYS\' if MPs vote for Common Market 2.0
Their voters will feel about this complete and utter sell-out and let down of their own voters
“I’ll bet you the Islington, middle-upper class, champagne socialist Labour Party have no idea how millions of their voters will feel about this complete and utter sell-out and let down of their own voters.”
MPs will vote today on their preferred Brexit options for a future relationship with the EU after Brexit in a series of indicative votes.
One of the motions regarding a Common Market 2.0 was tabled by Nick Boles, Tory MP for Grantham and Stamford, and subsequently backed by the Labour Party.
The motion calls for an enhanced Norway-style deal which would include membership of the EU’s single market as well as a customs arrangement with the EU.


Right-wing eurosceptics are set to dominate the polls in France and Italy, Nigel Farage could return to Brussels and the fight to become Jean-Claude Juncker’s successor could turn nasty – a growing list of potential disasters await the upcoming European elections. Matteo Salvini’s League are set to return the largest number of seats in Italy and Marine Le Pen’s National Rally is in a close battle to win the top spot from Emmanuel Macron’s La Republique En Marche in France, according to Politico. Mr Salvini is already manoeuvring to position himself as the unofficial leader of a populist bloc when the EU Parliament’s new MEPs first convene in July.
The Italian deputy prime minister hopes to bring together right-wing MEPs from Hungary, Austria and Poland, where populists are in power, and France and the Netherlands, where support for them is growing. Lega’s European election manifesto will “underline and reaffirm common Christian roots, defend national identity and the supremacy of the Italian constitution over European laws and directives”. The right-wingers will oppose European integration and austerity policies. According to reports in Italian media, Mr Salvini will host a event in Milan next week to secure the support of eurosceptics from over 20 countries for his parliamentary alliance. European eurosceptics could be joined by their British counterparts in the new Parliament, if Theresa May agrees to participate in the election in exchange for a long delay to Brexit.
EU Parliament elections set to give Brussels a massive headache
Mr Farage’s Brexit Party are primed and ready to put candidates forward for the ballot, which could take place on May 23 in the UK. Last month the former Ukip leader told MEPs in what he hoped was his “penultimate” speech in a European Parliament plenary session but said he would return if the Prime Minister and Brussels agree a long Brexit delay. Mr Farage said: “You’ve got your plan. You want the United States of Europe, you want your army, you want everyone to join the Euro, you want to get rid of the nation-states. We are just a damned nuisance. “In the European elections, you don’t want me coming back here, or hordes of Eurosceptics coming back here.” Yesterday Guy Verhofstadt, the EU Parliament\'s Brexit co-ordinator, told MEPs: "We cannot risk giving the keys of the EU’s future to a Boris Johnson, or a Michael Gove, the architects of this Brexit disaster. A long extension would do exactly that."
But the biggest row amongst pro-Europeans could breakout in the effort to replace Mr Juncker as European Commission president, with the 64-year-old set to step down in October. German MEP Manfred Weber successfully became the so-called Spitzenkandidat for the centre-right European People\'s Party – the process that hands the top job to the lead candidate from the biggest EU Parliament group. However, his credentials have been challenged and even Michel Barnier, the EU\'s chief Brexit negotiator, has been touted as a last-minute candidate for the role. Mr Weber has claimed any attempt to oust him from the running for Commission president would be seen as anti-democratic by EU citizens.


The Irish tax authority has warned business in the Republic could be cut off
This revelation has triggered an intervention from the Irish tax authority which has warned business in the Republic could be cut off if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. Given close trading links to its nearest neighbour, Irish customs officials are braced for a 12-fold rise in the number of import and export declarations made by local companies if Britain leaves the European Union\'s customs union. With Britain at risk of crashing out of the EU as soon as next week, Ireland\'s Office of the Revenue Commissioners and government urged firms to apply for an Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number, which will be needed to continue to move goods to, from or through the UK. Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said on Twitter: “IMPORTANT: Businesses trading with UK will need an EORI customs number in a no deal Brexit.
"Half of those who need it haven\'t yet applied. The Government cannot do it for you." The Government said it would take firms just a few minutes to register online. But the head of the Revenue Commissioners\' Brexit policy unit, Lynda Slattery, said some companies feel a non-negotiated Brexit is not going to happen.
Ms Slattery said the construction and manufacturing sectors did not appear to be engaging with customs officials and warned they will be turned away at ports if Britain leaves by the current deadline of April 12 and they do not have the right papers. She said: “If they are not engaging and they have made this decision, consciously because of the uncertainty, come the 12th or 13th, can their business survive that decision? "They need to understand the consequences now of making that decision. If this happens on the 12th, if their goods can\'t move, if they haven\'t made any preparations, what does that situation look like for them?"

With May’s vote just weeks away, experts say anti-EU parties have a chance to impact the future of the European Union if they join forces to work together. Far-right leaders share the broad ideological goals of curbing the EU\'s perceived liberal course and returning power to the member states\' capitals. But they differ in other areas. Investors expect heightened political uncertainty after the May 26 election, in which 705 members of the European Parliament MEPs will be elected, or 751 if Britain fails to leave the EU as planned.
General dissatisfaction over slow economic growth, security threats posed by Islamist militants and a backlash against migration across open EU borders have boosted support for eurosceptic nationalists in many member states. Susi Dennison, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said: "There is a growing confidence of voters to go against the norm. "The \'anti- forces\' are much more motivated right now than the pro-Europeans." Their gains and Brexit will mean a shake-up of the pan-national groups created by parties in the EU parliament, whose main role is checking and amending EU laws drawn up by the executive European Commission. Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini will launch his election campaign tomorrow in Milan, with a call to other eurosceptic parties across the continent to join forces with his League to form a new alliance within Brussels.
The EU elections are set to see a rise in eurosceptic parties, experts say
Buoyed by his own success and voter fatigue with mainstream parties, Salvini is trying to build bridges with the likes of French far-right leader Marine Le Pen and Austrian far-right politician Heinz-Christian Strache the May 26 vote. With the two biggest political blocs expected to lose their combined majority, he and other far-right leaders hope to form an opposition, eurosceptic alliance with enough seats in the assembly to block or hold up legislation. Salvini\'s foreign affairs advisor Marco Zanni said: "Our idea is to come together ... into a new party that better reflects the eurosceptical views that unite us. "Now is our chance to unite forces once and for all." Salvini\'s anti-immigrant League is forecast to more than quadruple its representation in the EU assembly with 27 seats.

Along with the projected rise for Le Pen\'s National Rally and Strache\'s Freedom Party of Austria, which is in a coalition government with Strache as vice-chancellor, the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) group to which they belong could be boosted to 61 seats from 37. Salvini, whose party co-rules Italy, wants to embrace other leaders whose parties are in rival groups. Even if parties do not come together, their presence in the European Parliament could create cracks in the EU. Mr Zanni of Salvini\'s League said there will be greater cooperation to try to influence or thwart EU policy. Ms Dennison added: "The risk is longer-term paralysis, that over time will erode the idea of EU as an effective actor." Duncan McDonnell, Professor of Politics in the School of Government and International Relations at Griffith University said the far-right increasingly saw itself as "part of a new wave".

Mark Francois was making the comments while he was on BBC Newsnight
Speaking on BBC Newsnight, Mr Francois waved off claims his European Research Group (ERG) had killed off Brexit by refusing to back Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal. On Monday night, royal assent was given to the bill that would rule out a no deal Brexit and give more time for negotiations to continue with the EU on how the UK will leave. But the ERG has been accused of jeopardising Brexit by repeatedly voting against Mrs May’s deal, a move some believe could halt the UK ever leaving the EU.
Farage and his Brexit party will ‘RISE like a PHOENIX’ in election
When quizzed by the BBC One show’s host Emily Maitlis about whether the bill would mean no deal would be off the cards, he was defiant.
He said: “No. The bill doesn’t actually prevent a no deal.
“It depends on the European Council. The bill gives the Prime Minister a mandate to suggest a date for an extension, but it doesn’t force the EU to agree.
“Both sides have to agree the extension.

The furious Brexiteer demanded the European Union show “mutual respect” as he warned the British people are growing “increasingly angry” at the lack of Brexit progress. During a passionate speech at a Bruges Group event on Tuesday, Mr Francois said: “We are generally slow to anger. Not for us, the donning of yellow jackets and setting fire to Oxford Street.
UK must \'look beyond EU\' for trade growth – \'world going GANGBUSTERS\'
Brexit has already gone on long enough
“But nevertheless, we do, in our very British way, have a strong sense of fair play and what is and isn’t right.
“And I believe that the British people are growing increasingly angry at attempts by some of their own Government, in cahoots with those in Parliament and the European Union, to essentially keep us in against our will.”
The Brexiteer MP reiterated that Britain voted to Leave in the 2016 referendum, adding: “Let’s just do it.”
Mr Francois concluded the speech with a stern message to the EU and said: “My earnest message to the European Council is simple. Brexit has already gone on long enough.


Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, threw out plans to make it easier for Britain to maintain an open border in a pledge to instead protect the single market. After crunch talks with the European Commission, Dublin rejected the possibility of customs checks being undertaken away from the border in the event of no deal. Britain has vowed to ensure no hardening of the Irish border but Brussels and Dublin are yet to reveal their own concrete plans.
Mr Coveney told a parliamentary debate: “We have to find a way of ensuring that we protect the single market\'s integrity and that we avoid physical infrastructure on the Irish border. “Ireland is not going to allow a situation where the UK leaving the European Union without a deal drags Ireland out of the single market with it. “What I mean by that is checks in EU ports on all Irish products, that is not a runner and would cause significant damage to our economy so we will not allow it." Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar has met with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in Paris ahead of the emergency Brexit summit.
Ireland mounts pressure on Theresa May to implement backstop in event of no-deal Brexit
Mr Varadkar warned: “As things stand the UK will leave the EU on April 12 without a deal. “However there is still time for the Prime Minister to come to the European Council with proposals that are credible and have a clear pathway to success and I think we need to be open to any proposals that she may bring forward to us.” Privately, Paris has warned Dublin that border checks will have to be implemented in the event of no deal in order to protect the EU’s single market. But no concrete plans have emerged despite months of negotiating hard Brexit contingency plans.
An EU diplomat said: “The EU, according to WTO rules, is forced to protect its custom borders.” Previously EU officials have pondered plans that could see customs checks carried out away from the border to prevent infrastructure being reintroduced. Another plot being worked up in Brussels would see Britain forced to implement the hated Irish backstop, guarantee citizens’ rights and pay its £39billion Brexit bill as the price to return to negotiations after a no-deal divorce. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, told a Brussels audience: “So we have to find operational solutions. The two parameters are number one, the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions, number two for us the respect for the integrity of the single market.


Theresa May said from Downing Street on Tuesday she will have to ask the European Union for a short extension to the Article 50 process as she attempts to break the Brexit deadlock by reaching out to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Hosting his LBC show, Nigel Farage reacted to the comments and said the statement simply prolongs the Brexit impasse. Mr Farage warned: “That was the Prime Minister basically saying we need national unity to deliver the national interest. Prime Minister, I would respond by saying we need leadership.
We may stay part of the customs union forever Nigel Farage
“My view is what we got from that statement was yet more fudge. “So, basically whatever happens in the future depends on Labour to a very large extent, the House of Commons has to agree, we must pass the withdrawal agreement, it must all be done by the 22nd May because otherwise people like that nasty Farage might stand in the European elections. “And I am basically going to accept that in the future political declaration we may stay part of the customs union forever. “My take on that is that that statement from the Prime Minister probably takes us no further forward whatsoever and maybe leads us even deeper into crisis because it’s all dependent upon her withdrawal treaty with amended, as it seems to me, political declarations passing and it may have taken us no further forward at all.”
Brexit news: Nigel Farage said Theresa May is leading Britain "into crisis"
In a statement from Downing Street following a marathon Cabinet meeting in Westminster today, the Prime Minister said she will meet with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to try and come up with a plan they can both agree on. Theresa May said in a statement from Downing Street that the UK could make a "success" of a no deal Brexit but insisted leaving with the EU is still the "best solution". She added the extension to Article 50 should be "as short as possible". Mrs May said: "I have always been clear that we could make a success of no-deal in the long term but leaving with a deal is the best solution. "So we will need a further extension of Article 50 - one that is as short as possible and which ends when we pass a deal.


The President of the European Commission almost set the Rwandan First Lady on fire during a ceremony to commemorate genocide. Shocking footage captured the horror moment Jean-Claude Juncker swung around and nearly hit the Rwandan First Lady with a flame-lit torch. In the video, the European Commission President, 64, lit the Flame of Remembrance before he appeared to try to hand the flaming torch to an official.
But, as he swiftly turned around, Mr Juncker came dangerously close to hitting Jeannette Kagame, wife of Rwandan president Paul. Mr and Mrs Kagame appeared to flinch and dodged backwards as the burning torch came just inches away from hitting them. An official quickly stepped in to ensure the European Commission President did not harm anyone with the large flame. After attending the event, the President of the European Commission wrote on Twitter: “I am moved beyond words at this memorial to tragedy.
Jean-Claude Juncker appeared to almost set the Rwandan First Lady on fire
“It serves as a bleak warning of the worst humanity is capable of. “But through the darkest of days, I remain in awe at the power of regeneration, of this country, and of humankind #Kwibuka25.” The ceremony, which took place on Sunday, started with the flame-lighting memorial, with the fire set to burn for 100 days. President Paul Kagame began a week of solemn ceremonies on Sunday to commemorate the lives of 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutus murdered during the Rwandan genocide, a three-month-killing spree that began 25 years ago.


Emmanuel Macron was challenged for his opposition to a lengthy Brexit delay after European leaders discussed nine-hours before conceding Britain a six-month extension. The French President has had to contend with growing dissent toward his leadership during the past year, with protesters rioting across France for 19 weekends in a row to oppose his tax and reform plans. Swedish MEP Peter Lundgren warned Mr Macron to focus on issues facing him at home and to avoid bringing "that mess" to European institutions.
Mr Lundgren told Channel 4 News: "President Macron, he has his hands full at home, I would say. "If you look at what happened, he promised everything to everyone and then he found out it’s not that easy to deliver that. "Now he has massive riots all over France to deal with. So, sorry Mr Macron, we don’t want that mess in the rest of Europe." The Swedish Democrat MEP also suggested the EU had provided the Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage with a boost ahead of the European parliamentary election with their decision to grant an extension.

Brexit news: Lundgren warned Macron not to bring France\'s "mess" to Brussels
The European Parliament elections in 2014 saw Ukip come out on top in a tight contest with 27.49 percent of the vote and 24 MEPs, followed by the Labour Party (25.4 percent and 20 MEPs) and Conservative Party (23.93 percent and 19 MEPs). But with the Brexit crisis engulfing the Tories since the EU referendum results in June 2016, and huge internal splits deepening over their handling of negotiations, the results could look very different in a few weeks time. Mr Lundgren continued: "I think it will be a massive support for Farage. "If they don’t deliver the Brexit as promised, and they go into a second referendum, they will see Farage back in the building with a lot of MEPs with him. "I am sure of that."

Italy news: The Italian government has slashed its growth forecast for this year
The Italian government has slashed its growth forecast for this year, highlighting the economic woes facing the debt-ridden nation, as Rome braced for a slowdown in growth to dent public finances. Italy is expecting 0.2 percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth for this year, down for a previous projection made in December of 1.0 percent. Announcing the downgrade yesterday, the Treasury also announced ramped up the 2019 budget deficit target to 2.4 percent of GDP, up from a 2.04 percent goal fixed in December following a bitter spat with the European Commission. The new deficit target is likely to enrage EU finance chiefs, with it being the same rejected by the Commission last autumn as being too high and breaking EU rules.
Vincenzo Longo, analyst at IG Markets, said: ”The deficit is the most thorny issue for Italy and could spark tensions with the European Union.” The Italian Treasury later said the “structural deficit”, adjusted for GDP growth fluctuations, would be 1.5 percent of GDP this year and in line with commitments made to Brussels. Italy spent much of the latter half of last year wrangling with the EU over its budget, with Rome being threatened with disciplinary action unless it takes action against its debt. The monetary agreement was finally passed at the end of December, after Italy agreeing to lower its deficit target for this year.
The deficit is the most thorny issue for Italy and could spark tensions with the European Union Vincenzo Longo, IG Markets
It comes after Italy fell into recession after a second consecutive quarter of decline was recorded for the last three months of 2018. The economy contracted by 0.2 percent in October to December of last year, after a decrease of 0.1 percent in July to September. Earlier this week the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast a 0.2 percent output fall in Italy this year. David Lipton, deputy director general of the International Monetary Fund, warned last week how Italy could record a new contraction for the first quarter of 2019, deepening the woes of the economy. Speaking in Lisbon, Portugal, Mr Lipton highlighted Italy as he spoke of the “glaring vulnerabilities" of some nations in the European Union which leave the bloc unprepared for future economic risks.

Theresa May is set to meet with the Labour Party leader for further Brexit talks after she reached out to Jeremy Corbyn to try to get a deal through the House of Commons. The move from the Prime Minister frustrated many Conservative MPs with some members of the Tory party’s eurosceptic European Research Group calling for Mrs May to step down. Speaking on ITV’s Peston on Wednesday evening, Brexit supporter and Conservative MP Nadine Dorries shocked Alastair Campbell by pointing out that voting for Britain to remain in the customs union would be worse than leaving the bloc.
She said: “She invited Jeremy Corbyn to Number 10 weeks ago. That’s when he walked out when he saw Chuka Umunna. “I think Parliament and Parliamentarians are letting the public down. “They voted in a referendum, they voted for Brexit. Parliamentarians are not getting behind the deal, they are not doing what they are supposed to. “Everybody is holding on to their own political ideology and not putting the country first. That is the problem.”

She added: “If Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May between them can come up with something that is acceptable, which is Brexit, which lets us free to go onto the next stage.” ITV’s Peston interrupted the Tory MP asking whether she would accept the UK remaining in the customs union. Ms Dorries replied: “I would not vote for a customs union because we may as well stay in.” Mr Campbell threw his hands into the air before he smirked shaking his head while sitting on the panel.


Eurozone warning: No-deal Brexit could spark a further slowdown in growth across the eurozone
ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos urged markets to brace for the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal in place, or risk amplifying a downward financial trend in Europe. Analysts have become increasingly concerned over the state of the euro area economy in recent months following a string of weak data releases pointing toward a slowdown in economic growth. The disappointing trend has been led by Germany, the largest economy in Europe, where the economic growth forecast was recently slashed by nearly half as manufacturing levels took a tumble. Speaking to lawmakers in the European Parliament, Mr de Guindos said: “We are living in a moment of slowdown of the global and the European economy.
“A no-deal that is not truly priced in by the market could be a sort of amplifier of the downhill turn of the deceleration of the European economy.” Although he described the risk as “manageable”, the main issue of a no-deal Brexit was piling pressure on an already fragile eurozone economy. He said: “This will be bad news on top of the fragility of the economy.” The ECB has shelved plans to raise interest rates this year, leaving banks, particularly in France and Germany, bracing for yet more losses on the excess cash they deposit at the central bank.
This will be bad news on top of the fragility of the economy Luis de Guindos
Mr de Guindos said the ECB was looking at ways of “tiering” the negative interest rate that banks pay on the idle cash, although no discussion had yet taken place among policymakers. He said: “We are continuously analysing the possibilities, alternatives in terms of tiering because in other jurisdictions they were implemented. “But so far we have not taken any decision.” Negative interest rates have been a feature of central banks’ response to the financial crisis that started a decade ago and have been credited with helping stave off the threat of deflation in 2014-16.

BBC Weather has forecast wintry weather to return for parts of Europe this week with snow, rain and sleet expected to sweep across the continent. BBC Weather forecaster, Ben Rich, warned some parts of the Alps would see “significant” snowfall, with the Swiss Alps potentially seeing up to two metres of fresh snow. Rich said: “We may be well into Spring now, but, there is a decidedly wintry feel across the western side of Europe over the next few days.
“You can see various stripes of cloud pushing in from the northwest. Frontal systems bringing in outbreaks of rain. Behind that this speckled cloud, indicates some wintry showers.” He added: “Those showers are going to become quite widespread across the western side of Europe during Wednesday across the British Isles, into France, northern Spain, and notice this weather system here bringing significant snow up over the Alpes. “Still got a scattering of thunderstorms across the south and the southeast of Turkey, one or two of those in Cyprus as well. “Turns increasingly cloudy across the Balkans and we will see some really strong winds blowing up across the Adriatic as well.
BBC Weather: Snow forecast to crash into the continent this week
Over the Swiss Alps over the next couple of days we could see one to possibly two metres of fresh snow BBC Weather forecaster, Ben Rich
“Southern Spain and Portugal fine with one sunshine, northern Spain, intro France seeing those wintry showers, a mixture of rain, sleet, and hail. Some snow over the Pyrenees and over the Alps. “In fact, over the Swiss Alps over the next couple of days, we could see one to possibly two metres of fresh snow. “Outbreaks of heavy rain into Italy, still those strong winds into the Adriatic. Generally into the western side of Europe, a rather cool feel to the weather on Thursday.” Moving towards the weekend, the BBC Weather forecaster added: “In Madrid on Friday, 9C, that is your top temperature, there will be some showers, showers not too far away from Rome as we move into the next five days, in London, it does turn a little less chilly.
Snow map shows where in Europe is likely to see snow this week
“Cooling off a bit in Berlin, Moscow mainly dry for the next five days.” It comes as the UK is bracing for snow to fall with bone-chilling Arctic air returning to Britain this week. BBC Weather forecaster Matt Taylor warned, “colder air” was on its way threatening to bring snow, rain and thunderstorms. He said: “Colder air is on its way this week. April showers in the mix as well. A mixture of hail, rain, sleet, even some snow at times and that could give a coating to the hills of northern England, potentially.” Moving into Wednesday, the BBC Weather forecaster said: “The weather front remains across eastern counties of England, into the end of the day, it is all linked to this area of low pressure which will remain by into Wednesday. Drawing in the winds this time from the Arctic.


The Ukip leader and MEP shocked the European Parliament with his speech in which he ridiculed European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker and Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier for working with Remainer “traitors” in Britain to scupper Brexit. During a fiery European Parliament speech, the MEP said the Brexit vote is “the only weapon the ordinary people have” as he urged Britons to vote for his party in EU elections. Mr Batten said: “Has the whole Brexit process fiasco been an elaborate conspiracy between Mrs May and the EU or is it just due to her monumental incompetence?
By all means ban me and watch my vote go up in the United Kingdom Gerard Batten
“Either way we have to hand it to you Mr Juncker and Mr Barnier – you have done what Philip of Spain, what Napoleon, what Kaiser Wilhelm and Hitler couldn’t do. “You have brought Britain to its knees without firing a single shot.” SNP MEP Alyn Smith branded Mr Batten’s speech a “disgrace” and was greeted with a round of applause as he told MEPs: “He does not speak for the people of the United Kingdom. “He barely speaks for his own party such as it still exists. “To use that sort of rhetoric in this house of democracy utterly shameful.
Brexit news: Gerard Batten says his vote will soar if he is banned from European Parliament
“Can I suggest that you and the presidency think whether or not this house should continue to give a platform to these to recurse for their poison. Thank you.” In response, Vice President of the European Parliament Mairead McGuinness shut down the MEP’s attempts to respond and said: “Excuse me, Mr Batten, I have the microphone and I will speak and then I may allow you to speak. “Can I say that I will definitely bring your issue to the president? I was also concerned about the use of another term, punishment beating, I find that a difficult term in the context of my own country. Sir, do you have a point?” Mr Batten then was given the microphone and roared: “This gentleman represents the party it claims it wants independence and yet it is happy to be subservient to the European Union.” The British MEP then raised his voice once more and shouted: “By all means ban me and watch my vote go up in the United Kingdom.” Britain is set to leave the EU without a deal on April 12 but leaders will convene with Theresa May days before in an attempt to negotiate another Brexit delay.


Theresa May is set to meet with the leaders of the European member states in Brussels on Wednesday to seek a further extension to the Brexit process. The Prime Minister is expected to agree to new terms binding Britain to take part in European parliamentary elections in May to get extra time to draft a new withdrawal agreement with the help of the Labour Party. But European Union expert Darren McCaffrey told Euronews the Prime Minister could see the European election turn into a new referendum on Brexit.
Mr McCaffrey said: "Almost certainly, Theresa May is going to commit to European election this week. They will spend tens of millions of pounds on it. "We may as well see those elections turn into a de facto referendum which could cause a great polarisation of views in Britain." The British reporter also suggested Mrs May could still decide to pull out of the election if the Labour Party and her own MPs reach a satisfactory alternative to her Brexit withdrawal agreement before the vote scheduled for May 23-May 26. He continued: "Theresa May’s slim hope is that, somehow, over the next couple of weeks, her and Jeremy Corbyn do agree on a type of customs union and it does get through Parliament and at the last minute she can cancel those elections. LISTEN HERE: Latest Brexit news from the Express.co.uk Final Countdown podcast
Brexit news: May could agree to take part in the election to then pull out if a deal is agreed
"I think, in reality, they are going to fight that and a lot of people will be angry." A Cabinet Office spokesman announced on Monday the British Government had launched preparations ahead of the May European vote but insisted Mrs May remained eager to reach an agreement by May 22. The spokesman said: "It remains the Government’s intention to leave the EU with a deal and pass the necessary legislation before May 22, so that we do not need to participate in European parliamentary elections,” the spokesman said. "As a responsible Government today we have taken the necessary steps required by law should we have to participate. “The Day of Poll Order provides returning officers with a date to hold potential European Parliamentary elections, but it does not make these elections inevitable as leaving the EU before the date of election automatically removes our obligation to take part.”


Mr Coveney said Ireland would support a request for a short Brexit delay but believes the Prime Minister will be forced to go longer to avoid a no-deal divorce. Speaking to Irish broadcaster RTE, Mr Coveney suggested Britain could last in its post-Brexit transition period for between two to four years after the country quits the Brussels bloc. In a Downing Street address, Mrs May told the nation she will pursue another Brexit delay in order to push her hated withdrawal agreement across the line.
Responding, Mr Coveney said: “They will look for a short extension next week, and I think Ireland will support that. “It is very unlikely that there will be any crash out at the end of next week with the prime minister looking for an extension with a plan to go with that.” But he warned that Dublin should continue to prepare for no deal despite believing the chances of a hard Brexit has diminished. “That does not mean Ireland should not continue to prepare for the consequences of a no deal, because there is of course the risk that all of this could collapse and that Britain could crash out,” he said.
Brexit news: Ireland support sort Article 50 delay
But the push to avoid a no-deal divorce could see Britain fully signed up to the EU’s rules for up to four years in order to strike a new trade agreement, he added. Amid EU warnings that hard borders would have to be implemented in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Coveney admit Dublin is yet to finalise on concrete plans to keep the Irish border open. He said the plans would have to protect peace on Ireland as well as the integrity of the single market. The EU’s tax and economy chief Pierre Moscovici said: “The EU customs code would apply to all goods arriving from the UK.
“If there is a no-deal scenario, new customs controls would have to be introduced. That does not mean we would systematically check every single lorry. “We would be controlling goods on the basis of risk analysis." Mr Coveney claimed Germany and France have not been piling pressure on Dublin to protect the bloc’s single market amid the fears of no deal. Mrs May will travel to Brussels on Wednesday in an attempt to broker another Brexit delay as part of an emergency European Council summit.

Brexit supporter Jacob Rees-Mogg has vowed to continue fighting for a true exit from the EU, even if MPs pass an amendment attached to the Prime Minister’s deal. On Monday MPs will vote again in the House of Commons on finding a path moving forward after the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal was rejected on Friday. But, the Conservative MP for North East Somerset warned about the prospect of a customs union amendment being passed by the Commons - which could destroy any chance of the UK striking post-Brexit trade deals with countries around the world.
Speaking on LBC, Mr Rees-Mogg said: “I am against the customs union option, because, you have got to remember the history of the European Union. “The customs union is the cornerstone of the European Union. It was why we joined in the early 1970s to join in this trading bloc which protected itself from the rest of the world. “That was under very different trading conditions when you needed to be in trading blocs. “That’s changed. If we are in the customs union we will not be able to do deals with other countries. We won’t get the benefits of cheaper food, clothing and footwear. We will still be tied into the high cost, inefficient, anti-consumer EU. So a customs union is a bad outcome.”

My concern is the Prime Minister is more concerned to avoid a no deal Brexit than anything Jacob Rees-Mogg
He added: “I wouldn’t accept it. The problem is if we don’t leave the European Union properly, people like me will carry on campaigning for us to leave properly just at a different date. “My concern is the Prime Minister is more concerned to avoid a no deal Brexit than anything, therefore I am very concerned she could decide to go for a customs union tacked onto her deal. “If that happens people like me will continue campaigning to get out of this customs union.” Mr Rees-Mogg also said Friday\'s vote on the Brexit deal would "probably have gone through" if it has been Mrs May\'s deal versus a general election. The Prime Minister’s Brexit withdrawal agreement was defeated on Friday afternoon by MPs in the House of Commons by 344 votes to 286.


The Irish tax authority has warned business in the Republic could be cut off
This revelation has triggered an intervention from the Irish tax authority which has warned business in the Republic could be cut off if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. Given close trading links to its nearest neighbour, Irish customs officials are braced for a 12-fold rise in the number of import and export declarations made by local companies if Britain leaves the European Union\'s customs union. With Britain at risk of crashing out of the EU as soon as next week, Ireland\'s Office of the Revenue Commissioners and government urged firms to apply for an Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number, which will be needed to continue to move goods to, from or through the UK. Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said on Twitter: “IMPORTANT: Businesses trading with UK will need an EORI customs number in a no deal Brexit.
"Half of those who need it haven\'t yet applied. The Government cannot do it for you." The Government said it would take firms just a few minutes to register online. But the head of the Revenue Commissioners\' Brexit policy unit, Lynda Slattery, said some companies feel a non-negotiated Brexit is not going to happen.
Ms Slattery said the construction and manufacturing sectors did not appear to be engaging with customs officials and warned they will be turned away at ports if Britain leaves by the current deadline of April 12 and they do not have the right papers. She said: “If they are not engaging and they have made this decision, consciously because of the uncertainty, come the 12th or 13th, can their business survive that decision? "They need to understand the consequences now of making that decision. If this happens on the 12th, if their goods can\'t move, if they haven\'t made any preparations, what does that situation look like for them?"
Crisis talks between Mrs May and Mr Corbyn took place


Theresa May is set to meet with the leaders of the European member states in Brussels on Wednesday to seek a further extension to the Brexit process. The Prime Minister is expected to agree to new terms binding Britain to take part in European parliamentary elections in May to get extra time to draft a new withdrawal agreement with the help of the Labour Party. But European Union expert Darren McCaffrey told Euronews the Prime Minister could see the European election turn into a new referendum on Brexit.
Mr McCaffrey said: "Almost certainly, Theresa May is going to commit to European election this week. They will spend tens of millions of pounds on it. "We may as well see those elections turn into a de facto referendum which could cause a great polarisation of views in Britain." The British reporter also suggested Mrs May could still decide to pull out of the election if the Labour Party and her own MPs reach a satisfactory alternative to her Brexit withdrawal agreement before the vote scheduled for May 23-May 26. He continued: "Theresa May’s slim hope is that, somehow, over the next couple of weeks, her and Jeremy Corbyn do agree on a type of customs union and it does get through Parliament and at the last minute she can cancel those elections.

Brexit news: May could agree to take part in the election to then pull out if a deal is agreed
"I think, in reality, they are going to fight that and a lot of people will be angry." A Cabinet Office spokesman announced on Monday the British Government had launched preparations ahead of the May European vote but insisted Mrs May remained eager to reach an agreement by May 22. The spokesman said: "It remains the Government’s intention to leave the EU with a deal and pass the necessary legislation before May 22, so that we do not need to participate in European parliamentary elections,” the spokesman said. "As a responsible Government today we have taken the necessary steps required by law should we have to participate. “The Day of Poll Order provides returning officers with a date to hold potential European Parliamentary elections, but it does not make these elections inevitable as leaving the EU before the date of election automatically removes our obligation to take part.”


BBC’s Europe Editor Katya Adler has claimed some EU leaders could be ready to grant the UK another short extension to try to get Brexit over the line. Reports suggest European Council President Donald Tusk favours a longer extension, of around a year, with the option to cut the delay short if a Brexit deal is agreed. Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show, BBC’s Europe Editor Adler claimed if there is a longer extension “EU leaders worry this could just go on forever”.
She said: “At the emergency Brexit summit on Wednesday in Brussels, all the 27EU leaders will first listen to Theresa May. “She will then be asked to leave the room while they discuss what to do about her extension request. “Very importantly they have to come to a unanimous decision under EU law and fireworks are predicted, whether it’s a massive display or just a regular one, we don’t quite know at the moment. “Basically the Prime Minister has asked for another extension ending at the end of June, there are EU leaders at the moment who say ‘well you know what, the advantage to that is it would keep MPs under pressure’.
BBC\'s Katya Adler claimed some EU leaders may favour a short Brexit delay
“Because if it is a short extension, they have to come to a decision, and based on past performance, EU leaders worry this could just go on forever. You have a longer extension and everybody will just go round and round.” She added: “They are really fed up with this process, they are not really fed up with the United Kingdom, and I think that’s really important to distinguish. “Some leaders are now saying, ‘might the UK change its mind’, but whatever happens if we leave it is in the EU’s interest, socially, economically and politically to keep us as close as possible and keep relations as close as possible. “Those who see a longer extension would be a good idea, so you have got Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council, he is calling for this so-called ‘flextension’, so it is a longer extension, but we can get out once a Brexit deal has been ratified. “Then it comes to Emmanuel Macron who has been saying loud and clear, ‘do not take any extension for granted because you Theresa May have to come to us with a very clear plan’. Again, a slight health warning on this. He said it last time and I think just when the Prime Minister speaks or Jeremy Corbyn, they are speaking to their own audiences.”

On Sunday the Prime Minister delivered a video message from her Chequers country retreat on delivering the result of the 2016 referendum. Mrs May said: "There are lots of things on which I disagree with the Labour Party on policy issues. "But on Brexit I think there are some things we agree on: ending free movement, ensuring we leave with a good deal, protecting jobs, protecting security. "And so we are talking. Can we find a way through this that ensures that we can get a good deal and a deal agreed through Parliament? "It\'ll mean compromise on both sides but I believe that delivering Brexit is the most important thing for us." The Prime Minister wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to the Article 50 process until June 30. She said she will seek to ratify her withdrawal agreement before the European Parliament elections on May 23, but will make "responsible preparations" to take part if that does not prove possible. Reports suggest Mr Tusk is recommending a longer postponement of one year, with a break clause in the case of earlier ratification, in a so-called "flextension" deal.


Speaking on TalkRADIO, the Liberal Democrats leader said he would "love" to debate Brexit mastermind Nigel Farage during the European election campaign. He argued he hopes all party leaders will be up for the challenge now that the UK will have to participate in the election, but claimed he would be content to debate Nigel Farage even if he was the only one to accept.
He said: “I am hoping that we will have proper leaders’ debates about this European election. “And I am certainly up for a proper debate with Nigel Farage. “I’d love to do that. He is a formidable debater and in many ways, he is an engaging character. “I think a debate of that kind I would certainly welcome.” Nigel Farage will lead the newly formed Brexit Party into the May elections. The eurosceptic party was set up three months ago due to fears over Brexit delays.

Last week alone it received “hundreds of thousands of pounds” in donations as it gears up for May’s European elections. The party is set to field 70 candidates across the country. An insider told the Financial Times: “You’ll be very pleasantly surprised by the sort of people who will be standing to represent the 17.4m people. “The message is going to be ‘deliver Brexit’: these elections are an opportunity to make your voice heard loud and clear to the powers that be.” Last weekend, Nigel Farage - leading the party for the upcoming European elections - revealed the party was selecting representatives from “all walks of life”.


The European Parliament Vice-President Mairead McGuinness claimed the European Union shared none of the blame - an answer met with silence from the audience - for the Brexit impasse after being quizzed on Question Time. BBC presenter Fiona Bruce asked the European Union chief if the bloc could have done more as the Prime Minister has been forced to enter talks with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to try to deliver Britain’s exit from the bloc. Bruce said: “One of the criticisms of Theresa May is that she triggered Article 50 too soon, but also that was something that came from the EU.
“The EU was not prepared to negotiate until Article 50 was triggered. That was made completely explicit. “Obviously there is a lot of criticism of Theresa May and her Government, does the EU share any of the responsibility for the mess we are in now, because of that?” Ms McGuinness replied: “Frankly, no.” The host quickly interrupted: “Because if we hadn’t triggered Article 50, some might argue we might have been able to reach a consensus and then trigger Article 50.”
BBC Question Time\'s Fiona Bruce quizzed Mairead McGuinness
That would be disrespecting the treaty, and rules matter Mairead McGuinness
Ms McGuinness said: “That would be disrespecting the treaty, and rules matter. “Before we even get to Theresa May, David Cameron came to Europe before he had the referendum, he got concessions which he completely refused, if you like failed to communicate, and he went for a referendum that frankly I knew he couldn’t win, because I didn’t think he was convinced himself. “The trouble for Europe is, why you are having this conversation, we are watching, and it’s not good for the European Union. “We would love you to stay, we respect your decision to leave, but we would like to know how you are going to go, and when.
“It is profoundly sad what the UK is doing. I am an Irish Member of Parliament, we are neighbours, we are close. “The Irish issue is obviously fundamental to the withdrawal agreement, I represent all of the counties along the invisible border. There is deep upset and hurt. “I think that Britain is hurting, that’s how I read it. I think there is a need for strong politics and maybe brave politics as well that would say we are in such uncertainty, that is it a longer extension you need, and when is that going to be asked for, and how is that going to be delivered?” Ms McGuinness added that the EU was at fault for “not taking on the Brexiteers in the European Parliament 10-years ago”. She added: “That we should have done”.


Whether he’s grinning in a family portrait or posing ahead of his first day of school, five-year-old Prince George often steals the show. When the cheeky prince was snapped pulling faces at Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank’s wedding last year, it endeared the public to him even more. His equally sweet sister Princess Charlotte is also a friend of the camera and is often snapped waving to the press.
But could Prince George have a younger royal rival? Prince Oscar of Sweden has been dubbed “the grumpiest royal ever” by Insider magazine. The three-year-old son of Sweden\'s Crown Princess Victoria and her husband Prince Daniel may have a moody streak, but boy is he cute. Unlike Prince George who’s a real crowd-pleaser, Oscar tends not to smile for the camera.

A European Commission source said on Tuesday the level of proposed US countermeasures was "greatly exaggerated", adding the amount of retaliation could only be determined by a World Trade Organisation arbitrator. "In the parallel Boeing dispute, the determination of EU retaliation rights is also coming closer and the EU will request the WTO-appointed arbitrator to determine the EU\'s retaliation rights," the Commission source said, adding the Commission was preparing so that it could take action after the arbitrator\'s decision. Airbus said it saw no legal basis for the US move and warned of deepening transatlantic trade tensions. The European Union is already facing US tariffs on its steel and aluminium exports and President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to hit EU cars with punitive duties.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told a conference in Paris that the two sides needed to reach a friendly agreement. "When I see the situation global growth is in, I don\'t think we can afford to have a trade conflict even if only on the specific issues of the aircraft industry in the United States and Europe," he said. The two sides are closing in on the climax of a record subsidy dispute that has been grinding its way through the WTO for almost 15 years. Both sides have won partial victories in claiming Airbus and Boeing received unlawful subsidies but disagree on the amount involved and whether each has complied with earlier WTO rulings. The US tariffs proposal put pressure on shares in European makers of aircraft and aerospace suppliers, wine, cheese and luxury goods. This morning Airbus shares were down 1.6 percent. Airbus suppliers such as Safran and Leonardo lost between 1.0 percent and 1.2 percent. MTU Aero Engines was 2.5 percent weaker and Rolls-Royce down 1.3 percent.

Aerial footage from Saltdean, Brighton captured protestors lining up over a cliff to launch a "symbolic SOS call" against Brexit. More than 400 people came together on the south coast of England to ask for the help of the European Union with mirrors to flash their distress call across the Channel. Artist Duncan McKellar set up the anti-Brexit stunt with the help of several volunteers who pitched up their mirrors around midday on Monday.
Mr McKellar acted with the permission of the local coastguard branch. The British artist last year organised a similar protest with volunteers standing at the US-Mexico border wearing mirror masks. The footage was shared on social media where the lineup sparked a hilarious response from the British public. One social media user said: "Makes a change. Those SOS messages have more traditionally come in the opposite direction." Another also cited historical events to suggest the protestors will not receive support from Brussels: "If they know anything about history they will be waiting a very long time to be rescued by Europe. On the other hand when Europe came calling..." LISTEN HERE: Latest Brexit news from the Express.co.uk Final Countdown podcast

Another took a dig at the French specifically, commenting: "Apparently the French mistook it for gunfire and surrendered." As emotions continue to run high among British voters, with Leave and Remain supporters holding protest marches within days of each other last week to either demand an immediate Brexit or a revocation of Article 50, Theresa May is hoping to find out the will of MPs with a series of indicative votes on Monday evening. MPs will consider rival options including the idea of staying in a customs union with the bloc, and a so-called Common Market 2.0. EU officials have accused them of being “detached from reality” - and warned the choice comes down to Mrs May’s divorce deal or a lengthy delay to the process of leaving the EU. Diplomats have said the Prime Minister’s deal is non-negotiable, and with the UK’s exit currently scheduled for April 12, they have warned rival plans would not excuse Britain from taking part in elections to the European Parliament, scheduled for May 23-26.
Brexit news: MPs will have a chance to vote on eight options to end the deadlock


The Independent Group MP got into a fiery debate as he called for Britain to have a so-called ‘People’s Vote’ on the final Brexit deal. The heated exchange began when the Sky News host said: “Interestingly, you spoke about an extreme Brexit. Well, a while ago I was talking to Sir Bernard Jenkin and he said to me that 90 percent of people who voted Leave in the 2016 referendum would prefer the UK to leave on no deal.
“So, he is set in his position and that’s not going to move. You are stuck in your position where you are calling for a People’s Vote. So, we remain at this impasse – we are not moving forwards on this.”
In response, Mr Umunna said Bernard Jenkin was one of the “architects of this mess”, adding: “He was a leading figure who created the Vote Leave campaign.”
But the Sky News host quickly fired back and said: “He could accuse you of being an architect for this mess because of the fact that you were calling for a People’s Vote and we have already had a referendum.”
Mr Umunna replied and claimed Britain does not have a People’s Vote so it is not “causing the chaos we find ourselves in now”.


The former Italian leader warned the European Union a surge of support for populist parties could spark a quick succession of Brexit-like departures among member states. The warning from Enrico Letta came as deputy Italian Prime Minister Matteo Salvini pledged to form a coalition of eurosceptic member states to end the EU "nightmare." Speaking to CNBC, Mr Letta said: "It is clear the victory of populist parties will bring, one after the other, 28 Brexits.
"The day after Brexit, if you take now the cause of Le Pen, Salvini, these people were happy of Brexit and they were saying to their countries ‘look at the British, they took the right decision, we have to do the same’. "Take the quotes of Salvini and di Maio on Italy. They were saying that we need to have a referendum, too, we have to decide in the same way." With May’s vote just weeks away, experts say anti-EU parties have a chance to impact the future of the European Union if they join forces to work together. Investors expect heightened political uncertainty after the May 26 election, in which 705 members of the European Parliament MEPs will be elected, or 751 if Britain fails to leave the EU as planned.

Mr Letta however insisted the changes of a complete change of structure of the European Parliament in favour of eurosceptic parties is unlikely. He continued: "My point is that I’m sure that populists won’t win the next European election. "They will be marginalised by the vote because they are divided and the European Parliament is a parliament where, if you are in a minority, you only have droit de tribune, nothing more." Buoyed by his own success and voter fatigue with mainstream parties, Mr Salvini has been trying to build bridges with the likes of French far-right leader Marine Le Pen and Austrian far-right politician Heinz-Christian Strache. With the two biggest political blocs expected to lose their combined majority, the Italian deputy leader and other far-right leaders hope to form an opposition, eurosceptic alliance with enough seats in the assembly to block or hold up legislation.


Prime Minister Theresa May will make a personal plea to France’s Emmanuel Macron in Paris today not to veto her request for a further delay to Brexit. Mrs May will also hold talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin to try and bolster support for her request to delay Brexit until June 30. EU leaders will be under pressure to decide whether to grant Britain another delay, a decision that can be vetoed by any of the other 27 member states.
Emmanuel Macron really has sold himself as Mr Europe and that’s the message that he keeps pushing Catherine Nicholson
But France 24’s Catherine Nicholson said the French President is set to take a hard line against the UK at an EU summit on Wednesday over fears the Brexit deadlock is destabilising the EU. She told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “Emmanuel Macron, he keeps repeating that it’s Europe’s interests that really has to come first here. “He really has sold himself as Mr Europe and that’s the message that he keeps pushing.” President Macron could demand there be no extension of the Article 50 process unless the Prime Minister signs up to binding commitments to stand aside from the EU decision-making process.
Brexit news: Theresa May to make personal plea to Macron over extension
Whereas Max Hoffman, who is Bureau Chief at Deutsche Welle in Brussels, said Angela Merkel is likely to be more patient than any other EU leader. Mr Hoffman added: “Angela Merkel is most likely one of those willing to have the most patience with the UK Government. “She has repeatedly said that there is still time. “And I have no doubt, just like many colleagues here in Brussels, that she will try and up until the last minute to avoid a no deal Brexit.”
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned it is "crucial to know when and on what basis the UK will ratify the Withdrawal Agreement" as the EU considers Mrs May\'s request to delay. Britain will leave the EU at 10pm on Friday if not Brexit extension is granted. As a result of the extension, Theresa May has been forced to find candidates for the European elections for six weeks time - one month after she said it would be “unacceptable” to take part in elections after the UK voted to leave the bloc. While the UK is seeking an extension of Article 50 to June 30, it looks likely the EU27 summit in Brussels will demand the UK extend Brexit to the end of the year.
Brexit news: Theresa May travels to Berlin on Tuesday


Theresa May said from Downing Street on Tuesday she will have to ask the European Union for a short extension to the Article 50 process as she attempts to break the Brexit deadlock by reaching out to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Hosting his LBC show, Nigel Farage reacted to the comments and said the statement simply prolongs the Brexit impasse. Mr Farage warned: “That was the Prime Minister basically saying we need national unity to deliver the national interest. Prime Minister, I would respond by saying we need leadership.
We may stay part of the customs union forever Nigel Farage
“My view is what we got from that statement was yet more fudge. “So, basically whatever happens in the future depends on Labour to a very large extent, the House of Commons has to agree, we must pass the withdrawal agreement, it must all be done by the 22nd May because otherwise people like that nasty Farage might stand in the European elections. “And I am basically going to accept that in the future political declaration we may stay part of the customs union forever. “My take on that is that that statement from the Prime Minister probably takes us no further forward whatsoever and maybe leads us even deeper into crisis because it’s all dependent upon her withdrawal treaty with amended, as it seems to me, political declarations passing and it may have taken us no further forward at all.”
Brexit news: Nigel Farage said Theresa May is leading Britain "into crisis"
In a statement from Downing Street following a marathon Cabinet meeting in Westminster today, the Prime Minister said she will meet with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to try and come up with a plan they can both agree on. Theresa May said in a statement from Downing Street that the UK could make a "success" of a no deal Brexit but insisted leaving with the EU is still the "best solution". She added the extension to Article 50 should be "as short as possible". Mrs May said: "I have always been clear that we could make a success of no-deal in the long term but leaving with a deal is the best solution. "So we will need a further extension of Article 50 - one that is as short as possible and which ends when we pass a deal.


The Government announced on Monday they have launched preparations to hold European elections in the United Kingdom should Britain be stuck into a long Brexit extension. A note from a Cabinet Office spokesman suggested the UK would however not be bound to take part in the vote if a deal were to be struck with the European Union before May 22, a day before the expected start of the vote. Nigel Farage suggested the announcement indicates Britain will effectively take part in the vote unless MPs agree to pass through Parliament Theresa May\'s proposed Brexit deal.
Responding to the note on his daily LBC show, Mr Farage said: "Folks, we are having European elections, we are having European elections. "She’ll go to the summit, she’ll beg in Berlin first, she’ll beg in Paris later on, she will then go on to prostrate herself in front of 27 other European leaders and, of course, the big boys like Barnier and Tusk and Juncker. "On Thursday, the legislation will be moved and the nomination for candidates will open this Friday. That’s pretty certain." Theresa May is expected to meet with German leader Angela Merkel on Tuesday ahead of a crunch meeting of the EU27 during which they will decide whether to accept a request for a further Brexit delay until June 30.

Brexit news: Farage warned May will use the European election to pressure MPs to back her deal
But Mr Farage argued the statement from Number 10 could be part of a strategy to force MPs to back the withdrawal agreement has been trying to deliver through the Commons since November. He continued: "What she’s saying is, and this is really classic Theresa May in a sense, is we’ll start the European election campaign but if you agree to my treaty in the intervening period we won’t actually hold the poll on the day. "Is this leadership? No wonder we’re the world’s laughing stock." Brussels has offered a longer extension to Article 50 to the Prime Minister, who is set to agree to it, meaning Brexit will be delivered around Christmas and the new year period. Christopher Hope, chief political correspondent for the Daily Telegraph, said on Twitter: “LATEST rumour swirling around the House of Commons: the EU and UK could agree to a nine-month extension to #Brexit to the end to the year.”


Theresa May said she would seek a longer extension past next week to allow talks with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to ensure Britain leaves the EU. But, the move has angered Brexit supporters, with some members of the Conservative Party’s eurosceptic European Research Group claiming it is time for Mrs May to step down. Speaking on Channel 4 News, Conservative Brexiteer Anne Marie Morris claimed Mrs May had “sacrificed” the 17.4million people who voted Leave, and issued a warning to the Prime Minister.
She said: “I think it is the 17.4million people who have been sacrificed because what now is on the table, frankly is simply not Brexit. “It is not delivering a Leave result, because what she is clearly looking at is a deal with Labour which effectively will be a customs union. “This does not deliver Brexit. It is something which is unacceptable. I expected her at this point…to recognise there would not be a deal and we would be better off outside negotiating from a better position.” The Brexiteer added: “We have far from given up and I think you will find there are lots of deeply frustrated Conservatives whatever way they voted on the withdrawal agreement that frankly will never vote for again.

“I would hold your conclusions and wait to see what unrolls and unravels. There are all sorts of moving parts here. It is partly what goes on in Parliament, and remember whatever has to get through both Houses. “It is partly about Europe, and whether or not they will grant an extension. I think she is a bit hopeful to think Brussels will grant her an extension until May 22 to avoid the European elections.” After a mammoth Cabinet meeting discussing the future of Brexit, the Prime Minister reached out to the Labour Party leader to help deliver Britain’s exit from the bloc. Mrs May said: “The ideal outcome of this process would be to agree an approach on a future relationship that delivers on the result of the referendum, that both the leader of the Opposition and I could put to the House for approval and which I could then take to next week\'s European Council.
"However, if we cannot agree on the single unified approach, then we would instead agree a number of options for the future relationship that we could put to the House in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue. "Crucially, the Government stands ready to abide by the decision of the House. But to make this process work, the opposition would need to agree to this too." In response, Mr Corbyn said he would not set any "limits" ahead of the meeting with the Prime Minister, but that his principles ahead of it were to recognise the "needs of the people that elected all MPs to Parliament and the need to avoid the dangers of crashing out". European Research Group (ERG) chairman Mr Rees-Mogg criticised the Prime Minister for planning to collaborate with "a known Marxist" in the Labour leader. He said: "I think getting the support of a known Marxist is not likely to instil confidence in Conservatives. This approach to Government is an unsuccessful one and it also lacks democratic legitimacy.


Mark Francois was making the comments while he was on BBC Newsnight
Speaking on BBC Newsnight, Mr Francois waved off claims his European Research Group (ERG) had killed off Brexit by refusing to back Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal. On Monday night, royal assent was given to the bill that would rule out a no deal Brexit and give more time for negotiations to continue with the EU on how the UK will leave. But the ERG has been accused of jeopardising Brexit by repeatedly voting against Mrs May’s deal, a move some believe could halt the UK ever leaving the EU.
Farage and his Brexit party will ‘RISE like a PHOENIX’ in election
When quizzed by the BBC One show’s host Emily Maitlis about whether the bill would mean no deal would be off the cards, he was defiant.
He said: “No. The bill doesn’t actually prevent a no deal.
“It depends on the European Council. The bill gives the Prime Minister a mandate to suggest a date for an extension, but it doesn’t force the EU to agree.
“Both sides have to agree the extension.

Lewis Hamilton has hailed Ayrton Senna ahead of Formula One\'s 1000th meeting
The Chinese Grand Prix will bring up 1000 F1 races in motorsport\'s premier competition. Hamilton is hoping to follow up on his Bahrain victory to leapfrog Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas to the top of the Drivers’ Championship. The Brit was asked to reflect on the most memorable race of his lifetime. And watching his late hero in action at Donington, where he overtook four drivers including the legendary Michael Schumacher on the opening lap, stood head and shoulders above the rest.
“I think everyone knows I was inspired by Ayrton Senna, and that’s where a lot of my passion for F1 came from,” Hamilton told the Chinese Grand Prix race programme. “I started watching Formula 1 with my dad when I was just four or five years old. I loved cars. “At the time, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost were the leaders of the pack and they immediately caught my attention. “I would come home from school and quite often put on a video of Ayrton Senna. I wanted to be him. I aspired to drive the way he drove, and to achieve something similar to what he achieved.
Ayrton Senna won the 1993 European Grand Prix
“And Ayrton’s great races would be among my favourites. You think of the amazing performances in Monaco. “But the one that obviously stands out for everyone is his incredible first lap of Donington, in the wet, at the European Grand Prix in 1993. “It was just phenomenal to watch.” Hamilton’s own personal favourites come from his five Championship-winning drives.

Brexit supporter Jacob Rees-Mogg has vowed to continue fighting for a true exit from the EU, even if MPs pass an amendment attached to the Prime Minister’s deal. On Monday MPs will vote again in the House of Commons on finding a path moving forward after the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal was rejected on Friday. But, the Conservative MP for North East Somerset warned about the prospect of a customs union amendment being passed by the Commons - which could destroy any chance of the UK striking post-Brexit trade deals with countries around the world.
Speaking on LBC, Mr Rees-Mogg said: “I am against the customs union option, because, you have got to remember the history of the European Union. “The customs union is the cornerstone of the European Union. It was why we joined in the early 1970s to join in this trading bloc which protected itself from the rest of the world. “That was under very different trading conditions when you needed to be in trading blocs. “That’s changed. If we are in the customs union we will not be able to do deals with other countries. We won’t get the benefits of cheaper food, clothing and footwear. We will still be tied into the high cost, inefficient, anti-consumer EU. So a customs union is a bad outcome.”

My concern is the Prime Minister is more concerned to avoid a no deal Brexit than anything Jacob Rees-Mogg
He added: “I wouldn’t accept it. The problem is if we don’t leave the European Union properly, people like me will carry on campaigning for us to leave properly just at a different date. “My concern is the Prime Minister is more concerned to avoid a no deal Brexit than anything, therefore I am very concerned she could decide to go for a customs union tacked onto her deal. “If that happens people like me will continue campaigning to get out of this customs union.” Mr Rees-Mogg also said Friday\'s vote on the Brexit deal would "probably have gone through" if it has been Mrs May\'s deal versus a general election. The Prime Minister’s Brexit withdrawal agreement was defeated on Friday afternoon by MPs in the House of Commons by 344 votes to 286.


Alastair Campbell revealed Brexit supporter Julia Hartley-Brewer was the “Leaver” former British Prime Minister Tony Blair “liked” during a radio interview. Mr Blair’s former head of communications, Mr Campbell claimed he could “destroy” Julia’s credibility by revealing the former prime minister’s admission. The Brexiteer radio host burst out laughing once hearing the remark, before pointing out one thing “in common” she shares with Mr Blair.
Mr Campbell told talkRADIO: “I have just been on the phone to the leader of the last strong and stable government that Britain had - namely Tony Blair. “I said to him, ‘Tony, I have to go because I am just about to do a radio interview’. “He said ‘who is that with’ and I said Julia Hartley-Brewer’. “Do you know what he said? Because this is going to destroy your credibility, Julia.

“He said ‘she is the Leaver I like’.” The radio host burst out laughing, before saying: “Well, I did do an event with Tony Blair some months ago, and we discovered something in his speech, we do have something in common because he is not allowed to go to Labour Party conference either.” It comes following another chaotic evening in the House of Commons after MPs voted to seek a delay to Brexit rather than risk the UK crashing out of the bloc on April 12, which was passed by 313 votes to 312. Tory Mark Francois, the MP for Rayleigh and Wickford, reacted to the Bill\'s passing with anger, calling it a "constitutional outrage" On Thursday Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will meet with the Prime Minister again to try to find a solution to the Brexit deadlock. Theresa May reached out to the opposition earlier this week after a mammoth 7-hour Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.


Nigel Dodds, the DUP’s Commons leader, claimed the European Union had “backed down” as they faced the prospect of Brexit Britain leaving the bloc without a deal. Mr Dodds called for the Prime Minister to learn the no deal “lesson” after the European Union granted Britain another Article 50 extension until the end of October. The DUP’s deputy leader said: “Up until yesterday the EU were saying try clearly it wouldn’t grant an extension unless there was a credible plan, an election, a referendum or respect of getting a withdrawal agreement through soon, it wouldn’t grant an extension. And if it did there would be stringent conditions.
“In fact, neither of those were held to by the European Union. Because when they were faced with the unpalatable choice of a no deal, they backed down. “Will the Prime Minister learn the lesson of that. She continues to reiterate what the EU have said about the withdrawal agreement and praise her withdrawal agreement. “She and the rest of the frontbench voted for changes to the backstop of the withdrawal agreement and the Attorney General in his devastating critique of it said it hadn’t changed the fundamentals of what was agreed. “Can the Prime Minister please examine where she is going with this. Learn the lessons and come back with something that can actually get a majority in this House.”

When they were faced with the unpalatable choice of a no deal, they backed down Nigel Dodds
Mrs May replied: “We have consistently sought to change the withdrawal agreement, in particular, to change the backstop, he will know full well we have argued on many occasions for a time limit or a unilateral exit clause or the replacement by alternative arrangements before the withdrawal agreement was originally agreed in November. The Government pushed consistently for an exit clause to the backstop, but the EU did not agree to it then. “After the first meaningful vote we raised the issue again, and we sought to change the withdrawal agreement, and pushed for it to be replaced by alternative arrangements. “On March 11 we had an exchange of letters between myself and the Presidents of the Commission and the EU Council in January. On March 11 in Strasbourg the President of the European Commission and I agreed to a package which means the EU cannot try to trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely, it is explicitly a breach of the legally binding commitments we have made if they do so. “And there is a legal commitment that both parties aim to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by December 2020.”
The remaining 27EU nations offered Theresa May a further six months to ratify or alter her withdrawal deal after the Prime Minister asked the bloc for an extension until June 30. Speaking in the House of Commons, the Prime Minister told MPs it was their "national duty" to agree to a Brexit deal. She said: “We need to resolve this. So that we can leave the European Union with a deal as soon as possible. “So that we can avoid having to hold those European Parliamentary elections. And above all, so that we can fulfil the democratic decision of the “Referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward.


Mr Juncker told reporters he is a “bit worried” about the state of Italy’s economy after several high-profile clashes with the country’s populist government over its finances. The 64-year-old Commission president said he wanted to see more action from Rome to boost financial growth. He met with Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte, who has previously blamed Brussels for Italy’s poor fiscal economy.
In a joint press conference after their discussions, Mr Juncker said: “I am a bit worried to see that the Italian economy hasn’t stopped regressing. “I would like the Italian authorities to make extra efforts to maintain growth.” On Monday the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development warned Italy’s struggling economy and challenging budget require urgency measures to take control of Rome’s poor finances and lower public debt. Mr Conte defending his government, a coalition comprised of right-wing party League and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, insisting Rome is sticking to “expansive and responsible” policies.

He instead blamed “the slowdown of the global economy” on a global trade war, which hampering European manufacturers. The Italian prime minister said: “To react to this, European Union member states that have more fiscal room for manoeuvre should use it to boost internal demand through investment.” Italy has been hunting foreign investment from China in recent weeks, much to the annoyance of Germany and China. Mr Juncker failed to be drawn into the row ahead of an EU-China summit in Brussels next week.


Economy minister Peter Altmaier, who has been crucial in Germany’s Brexit policymaking, insisted another Article 50 extension should be used to prevent a “big crash”. He said companies with close trading links to Britain could be forced to lay-off staff if there is a hard Brexit. Theresa May is set to ask EU leaders for another Brexit delay at an emergency summit in Brussels next Wednesday.
Reacting, Mr Altmaier said: “The EU and Great Britain can and must prevent the big crash on the last few metres, because thousands of jobs are at stake! If necessary, by a sufficient extension of the withdrawal period.”
He added: “Companies with a high export to Great Britain can generally be affected. I hope, however, that this will not lead to layoffs.”
The German economy minister also revealed that he wants Britain to remain in the customs union in order to keep products cheaper in his own country.
Asked about the risk of Brexit to supermarket prices, he said: “The risk may exist with products imported from the UK, for example car parts and whisky.


Speaking on Brexitcast, the BBC Brussels correspondent claimed the "strongest link" between the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration agreed between the Prime Minister and the EU is the Irish backstop protocol. Mr Fleming argued the controversial arrangement that has caused both Brexiteers and Remainers to vote against Mrs May\'s proposal, will act as the"base level" of the future relationship between the UK and the EU post-Brexit.
He said: “The strongest link of all is the backstop because that is the basis on which everything will be based because you can only go up from the backstop for the future permanent relationship. “And that’s the sort of secret on this side that people don’t like to talk about. “The backstop is talked about as an insurance policy but it’s actually a base level of what you can have in the future to avoid a hard border in Ireland unless amazing alternative arrangements that no one can actually imagine right now will come in.” It comes as the Prime Minister invited Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to join "national unity" talks aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock.

The cross-party talks will aim at an agreement on changes to the political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the Brussels bloc. Mrs May is set to ask the EU for a further Brexit delay at an emergency Brussels summit next week to give more time to agree a revised plan for the UK\'s future relationship with the bloc to go alongside her withdrawal agreement. Aides said she would talk "constructively" with her political foe, declining to rule out that a customs union or even a second referendum may be part of a new Brexit plan. "This is a decisive moment in the story of these islands. And it requires national unity to deliver the national interest," the PM said in a televised statement from Downing Street following a marathon seven-hour Cabinet meeting.


Prime Minister Theresa May travelled to Brussels on Wednesday to meet with EU leaders after she requested an extension to Britain’s departure from the Brussels bloc. Mrs May was filmed joking with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and president of the European Council Donald Tusk just moments before delivering a Brexit speech to her EU counterparts. In the footage, the Prime Minister and Mrs Merkel both begin laughing at something on a tablet.
The pair then share the joke with EU officials and then the president of the European Council, before Mr Tusk is seen bursting out with laughter. BBC’s Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg tweeted: “IPAD NEWS! the gag was apparently a side by side pic of May and Merkel taking questions in their own parliaments this afternoon, wearing the same colour of jacket..... #brexitbantz, kind of”. As she arrived at the EU summit, Mrs May was asked if she was “embarrassed” about having to ask for an extension. The Prime Minister said: “I know many people will be frustrated that the summit is taking place at all because the UK should have left the EU by now.
Brexit news: Theresa May appeared to share a joke with Angela Merkel
The purpose of this summit is to agree an extension which gives us more time to agree to a deal Theresa May
“I greatly regret the fact that Parliament has not been able to pass a deal that would enable us to leave in a smooth and orderly way.” She added: “But, I and the Government continue to work to find a way forward. We have been talking with the opposition and there has been serious constructive talks. They will continue tomorrow. “The purpose of this summit is to agree to an extension which gives us more time to agree to a deal to enable us to leave the EU in that smooth and orderly way. “What matters I think is that I have asked for an extension to June 30, but what is important is that any extension enables us to leave at the point of which we ratify the withdrawal agreement. So we could leave on the 22 May and start to build our brighter future.”
Speaking in Brussels, EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that any extension to the Article 50 process “must serve a purpose”. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte opened up on the division among the EU27 over the length of any extension. He told reporters: “It is very well possible that we will decide to prevent a no deal Brexit tonight. "We will have several important discussions, on how long will an extension be and what conditions will be attached to it.


Opening his radio show, leading Brexit supporter and Conservative MP Nigel Farage delivered a passionate speech about Britain still being a member of the EU. On Friday the Prime Minister’s withdrawal agreement was defeated in the House of Commons and MPs will vote on amendments on Monday to try to find a solution moving forward. Speaking on his LBC show, Mr Farage claimed it was “one of the saddest” episodes in Britain’s history that the UK was still a member of the Brussels bloc.
He said: “Good morning, it is Sunday, March 31 2019. Guess what? We are still members of the European Union. Despite the fact, we were supposed to be leaving. “The Prime Minister telling us over 100 times we would leave. 500 MPs voting for us to leave on that day, with or without a deal. “I have to say, for me, I think this is one of the saddest, worst episodes in the history of our country. “I fear that our democracy is dying and our faith in our whole electoral system, our governmental system, I think it is a bad moment.”

After her plan was rejected by MPs, by 344 votes to 286, the Prime Minister warned she feared “we are reaching the limits of this process in this House”. Theresa May said: “This House has rejected no deal. It has rejected no Brexit. On Wednesday it rejected all the variations of the deal on the table. “And today it has rejected approving the withdrawal agreement alone and continuing a process on the future. “This Government will continue to press the case for the orderly Brexit that the result of the referendum demands."


The Tory MEP outlined exactly why he thinks the European Union is responsible for the Brexit impasse during a heated row with an Irish MEP. Speaking on euronews\' Raw Politics, Mr Hannan said: “The reason we are in this position is because the EU is making of the UK a demand that it wouldn’t make of any other country for permanent control of our trade policy and the regulatory annexation of part of our territory. I mean, imagine if it had said to Canada during the trade talks, ‘we will only sign a trade deal if you give us regulatory control of Quebec and we control your trade and, by the way, we might not give you the trade deal after all. I mean, of course, we are not going to sign up for that’.
The EU is making of the UK a demand that it wouldn’t make of any other country Daniel Hannan
The comments sparked a huge row between the Brexiteer and Irish MEP Matt Carthy, who fired back and said: “That’s not what happened. “The proposal put forward by the European Union was a backstop that covered Northern Ireland. It was Theresa May’s proposal that that would encompass the entire United Kingdom as she would see it. “And then turn around the number of weeks later and said ‘no British Prime Minister would ever say it’. “The reason we are in the difficulty that we are in is because the British Government’s bad fate.”
Brexit news: Brexiteer Daniel Hannan said the Brexit deadlock is due to the EU\'s demands
The Sinn Féin MEP insisted there are three underpinning principles of the Good Friday Agreement which have not been respected. He said: “One, is the principle of consent. That is where everybody agreed, the Irish Republicans as well as everybody else, said there would be no constitutional change to the status of the North of Ireland.” Mr Hannan fired back and said: “It is a constitutional change. This Brussels control of the Northern Ireland economy is a constitutional change.” As the pair continued to shout over each other, the Irish MEP blasted: “It is removing the north from the EU. That’s the big constitutional change against the democratically expressed wishes of the majority of those who voted. “The second thing is the rights of people in the north to be British, Irish or both.”


The Labour Party have whipped MPs to betray the 2017 Labour Party manifesto, which stated the party would have ended the freedom of movement with Brexit . Speaking on his LBC show, Mr Farage ridiculed the decision and said: “I’m getting a reaction from LBC listeners on Facebook. Theresa says she used to be Labour and will never vote again. James says ‘all my family aren’t voting Labour’. Mark says ‘Labour are sell-outs’. Pete says ‘Labour, never again’.
Brexit could happen \'within DAYS\' if MPs vote for Common Market 2.0
Their voters will feel about this complete and utter sell-out and let down of their own voters
“I’ll bet you the Islington, middle-upper class, champagne socialist Labour Party have no idea how millions of their voters will feel about this complete and utter sell-out and let down of their own voters.”
MPs will vote today on their preferred Brexit options for a future relationship with the EU after Brexit in a series of indicative votes.
One of the motions regarding a Common Market 2.0 was tabled by Nick Boles, Tory MP for Grantham and Stamford, and subsequently backed by the Labour Party.
The motion calls for an enhanced Norway-style deal which would include membership of the EU’s single market as well as a customs arrangement with the EU.


John Elliott, the founder of the manufacturer of washing machines and dehumidifiers in the UK, has called for Britain to leave the European Union with no deal and “play hard” in order to get a pragmatic response from the Brussels bloc. Speaking to BBC 5 Live’s Emma Barnett, Mr Elliott said: “I think the problem with the EU is it is not a very good organisation – they add nothing but cost and bureaucracy. So, that’s why, I think, the European Union will eventually fail.”
As long as they think that they will play hard, as soon as we are out they will become more pragmatic John Elliott
The multi-millionaire businessman said there are “lots of mistakes” in the claims made surrounding a no deal Brexit, adding: “Remember, the EU want Brexit to fail and we are giving them hope for that as well. “So, as long as they think that they will play hard, as soon as we are out they will become more pragmatic.” Mr Elliott insisted the EU “adds nothing but cost” and said it is best for Britain to walk away from the Brussels bloc and set its own tariffs. If the UK left the EU without an arrangement in place it would automatically trade under WTO rules.

The Brexiteer said Britain does not need to stay close to the Union and added: “We joined the common market where we import more than we export. And we pay for money that doesn’t exist.” He ridiculed the negative sentiment from large businesses surrounding Brexit and said: “It’s the big organisations because they like the EU, don’t they? "It’s more important what is right for the country than individual businesses. “We will survive. It’s what is right for the country – that is more important than what is right for businesses. Businesses serve the people and not the other way around.”


Eurozone warning: No-deal Brexit could spark a further slowdown in growth across the eurozone
ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos urged markets to brace for the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal in place, or risk amplifying a downward financial trend in Europe. Analysts have become increasingly concerned over the state of the euro area economy in recent months following a string of weak data releases pointing toward a slowdown in economic growth. The disappointing trend has been led by Germany, the largest economy in Europe, where the economic growth forecast was recently slashed by nearly half as manufacturing levels took a tumble. Speaking to lawmakers in the European Parliament, Mr de Guindos said: “We are living in a moment of slowdown of the global and the European economy.
“A no-deal that is not truly priced in by the market could be a sort of amplifier of the downhill turn of the deceleration of the European economy.” Although he described the risk as “manageable”, the main issue of a no-deal Brexit was piling pressure on an already fragile eurozone economy. He said: “This will be bad news on top of the fragility of the economy.” The ECB has shelved plans to raise interest rates this year, leaving banks, particularly in France and Germany, bracing for yet more losses on the excess cash they deposit at the central bank.
This will be bad news on top of the fragility of the economy Luis de Guindos
Mr de Guindos said the ECB was looking at ways of “tiering” the negative interest rate that banks pay on the idle cash, although no discussion had yet taken place among policymakers. He said: “We are continuously analysing the possibilities, alternatives in terms of tiering because in other jurisdictions they were implemented. “But so far we have not taken any decision.” Negative interest rates have been a feature of central banks’ response to the financial crisis that started a decade ago and have been credited with helping stave off the threat of deflation in 2014-16.
Eurozone warning: ECB President Mario Draghi


The former Italian leader warned the European Union a surge of support for populist parties could spark a quick succession of Brexit-like departures among member states. The warning from Enrico Letta came as deputy Italian Prime Minister Matteo Salvini pledged to form a coalition of eurosceptic member states to end the EU "nightmare." Speaking to CNBC, Mr Letta said: "It is clear the victory of populist parties will bring, one after the other, 28 Brexits.
"The day after Brexit, if you take now the cause of Le Pen, Salvini, these people were happy of Brexit and they were saying to their countries ‘look at the British, they took the right decision, we have to do the same’. "Take the quotes of Salvini and di Maio on Italy. They were saying that we need to have a referendum, too, we have to decide in the same way." With May’s vote just weeks away, experts say anti-EU parties have a chance to impact the future of the European Union if they join forces to work together. Investors expect heightened political uncertainty after the May 26 election, in which 705 members of the European Parliament MEPs will be elected, or 751 if Britain fails to leave the EU as planned.

EU news: Juncker has been warned a populist victory could end the Union
Mr Letta however insisted the changes of a complete change of structure of the European Parliament in favour of eurosceptic parties is unlikely. He continued: "My point is that I’m sure that populists won’t win the next European election. "They will be marginalised by the vote because they are divided and the European Parliament is a parliament where, if you are in a minority, you only have droit de tribune, nothing more." Buoyed by his own success and voter fatigue with mainstream parties, Mr Salvini has been trying to build bridges with the likes of French far-right leader Marine Le Pen and Austrian far-right politician Heinz-Christian Strache. With the two biggest political blocs expected to lose their combined majority, the Italian deputy leader and other far-right leaders hope to form an opposition, eurosceptic alliance with enough seats in the assembly to block or hold up legislation.


Theresa May was granted a six-month Brexit extension until the end of October after the Prime Minister originally wrote to the bloc to ask for a delay until June 30. On this week’s Brexit The Final Countdown podcast, presenter Rebecca Hutson was joined by Express.co.uk Head of News Paul Baldwin and Video News Editor Thomas Hunt. Mr Baldwin claimed the Prime Minister would go down “as laughable a figure in history as Neville Chamberlain” as he branded Mrs May’s ‘Brexit means Brexit’ slogan as “utterly meaningless”.
He said: “Neville Chamberlain came back after meeting that nice Mr Hitler with a piece of paper and he landed and said famously, I have in my hand a piece of paper guaranteeing peace in our time. “A few months time the worst war the world has ever seen broke out. Obviously, he got that one wrong. “By the same token, her slogan ‘Brexit means Brexit’, will be as utterly meaningless as ‘peace in our time’. “She will be as laughable a figure in history as Neville Chamberlain because she has misread the entire situation for a really long time.” LISTEN TO BREXIT: THE FINAL COUNTDOWN HERE ON ITUNES

Speaking before Wednesday’s EU summit earlier in the show, Mr Baldwin added: “It makes you wonder what the deal that scrapes through would be, because if she is having to beg the EU for more time. She is having to beg her party to fall in line. She is having to beg Corbyn to also fall in line and stop being mean to her. She has tried begging the DUP to try to uphold the billion-pound bargain. “She has proved she is not great at this, I think. We might admire her stoicism. But, I think even that is wearing a bit thin with even her more ardent supporters. “Another thing, if we get an extension, the chances of her being in power and controlling what happens in that extension are nil.

And above all, so that we can fulfil the democratic decision of the referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward. “This is our national duty as elected members of this House - and nothing today is more pressing or more vital.” Responding to the Prime Minister, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: "Yesterday EU leaders agreed to grant the United Kingdom an Article 50 extension until the 31st of October.

Mr Juncker failed to be drawn into the row ahead of an EU-China summit in Brussels next week.


Right-wing eurosceptics are set to dominate the polls in France and Italy, Nigel Farage could return to Brussels and the fight to become Jean-Claude Juncker’s successor could turn nasty – a growing list of potential disasters await the upcoming European elections. Matteo Salvini’s League are set to return the largest number of seats in Italy and Marine Le Pen’s National Rally is in a close battle to win the top spot from Emmanuel Macron’s La Republique En Marche in France, according to Politico. Mr Salvini is already manoeuvring to position himself as the unofficial leader of a populist bloc when the EU Parliament’s new MEPs first convene in July.
The Italian deputy prime minister hopes to bring together right-wing MEPs from Hungary, Austria and Poland, where populists are in power, and France and the Netherlands, where support for them is growing. Lega’s European election manifesto will “underline and reaffirm common Christian roots, defend national identity and the supremacy of the Italian constitution over European laws and directives”. The right-wingers will oppose European integration and austerity policies. According to reports in Italian media, Mr Salvini will host a event in Milan next week to secure the support of eurosceptics from over 20 countries for his parliamentary alliance. European eurosceptics could be joined by their British counterparts in the new Parliament, if Theresa May agrees to participate in the election in exchange for a long delay to Brexit.
EU Parliament elections set to give Brussels a massive headache
Mr Farage’s Brexit Party are primed and ready to put candidates forward for the ballot, which could take place on May 23 in the UK. Last month the former Ukip leader told MEPs in what he hoped was his “penultimate” speech in a European Parliament plenary session but said he would return if the Prime Minister and Brussels agree a long Brexit delay. Mr Farage said: “You’ve got your plan. You want the United States of Europe, you want your army, you want everyone to join the Euro, you want to get rid of the nation-states. We are just a damned nuisance. “In the European elections, you don’t want me coming back here, or hordes of Eurosceptics coming back here.” Yesterday Guy Verhofstadt, the EU Parliament\'s Brexit co-ordinator, told MEPs: "We cannot risk giving the keys of the EU’s future to a Boris Johnson, or a Michael Gove, the architects of this Brexit disaster. A long extension would do exactly that."
But the biggest row amongst pro-Europeans could breakout in the effort to replace Mr Juncker as European Commission president, with the 64-year-old set to step down in October. German MEP Manfred Weber successfully became the so-called Spitzenkandidat for the centre-right European People\'s Party – the process that hands the top job to the lead candidate from the biggest EU Parliament group. However, his credentials have been challenged and even Michel Barnier, the EU\'s chief Brexit negotiator, has been touted as a last-minute candidate for the role. Mr Weber has claimed any attempt to oust him from the running for Commission president would be seen as anti-democratic by EU citizens.

Police clashed with thousands of migrants in disturbing scenes
Greek officers fired tear gas as angry migrants hoping to make their way to northern Europe hurled stones and bottles after being barred from reaching a nearby border crossing, witnesses said. Syrian refugee Yaser said: “We don\'t want to fight with the Greek police. We want to go to Europe, we don\'t want to stay in Greece.” Wife Fatemeh, who was carrying their six-month old baby, said the family was determined to stay at the makeshift camp. She added: “We will stay here until the borders open, we don\'t have any other choice.”
Spurred by a fake rumour about border openings that had spread on social media, hundreds of migrants and refugees arrived and pitched tents on Thursday in a field next to the Diavata migrant camp near Greece\'s border with North Macedonia. In neighbouring Turkey, nearly 1,200 migrants heading toward the border with Greece following false rumours that Ankara had opened its frontier were detained on Friday, Turkish media said.There were dozens of tents in the field and riot police formed a cordon to block an access route, parking 20 buses to stop the migrants from leaving the field. Authorities also sent buses to take people back to housing settlements.
Greek officers fired tear gas as angry migrants
At midday, riot police fired teargas at dozens of people - some carrying children - who hurled stones and bottles as they tried to break through the police cordon and reach the main road leading to the border. The scuffles lasted for several hours and thick plumes of smoke rose over the fields as police fired flares to disperse the crowds and angry migrants started small fires. Jana Frey, country director for the International Rescue Committee Greece, said the unrest highlighted "the amount of false information being presented to asylum seekers and refugees."

Italy news: Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte
The Italian Treasury will announce it expects the economy to expand by little over zero in 2019, Bloomberg reported, citing senior officials who referenced a draft report due for approval on 10 April. News of the lower growth forecast, which is down from a previous prediction for a 1 percent expansion, send the euro and Italian FTSE MIB lower. The single currency fell 0.19 percent against the US dollar to $1.1213. The euro is nearing the $1.1174 level reached on March 7, which if broken would send the currency to its weakest levels since June 2017.
As of just after 3pm UK time, the FTSE MIB is at 21,727, down 0.13 percent. Bloomberg went on to report the Italian Government is targeting a deficit of 2.3 or 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), from a projected 2.04 percent previously forecast in its controversial budget. The forecasts could still be revised before they are approved by the cabinet next week, the officials said. Il Sole 24 Ore daily reported last week how Italian finance chiefs are hopeful a planned growth boosting package may lift this estimate to 0.2 percent.
A serious recession could be very damaging for these countries David Lipton, IMF
The Italian economy has felt the brunt of a turbulent few months after plunging into recession territory following months of wrangling with the European Union (EU) over its budget. Italy fell into recession after a second consecutive quarter of decline was recorded for the last three months of 2018. The economy contracted by 0.2 percent in October to December of last year, after a decrease of 0.1 percent in July to September. Rome was warned yesterday by David Lipton, deputy director general of the International Monetary Fund, that the nation could record a new contraction for the first quarter of 2019, deepening the woes of the economy.

The President of the European Commission almost set the Rwandan First Lady on fire during a ceremony to commemorate genocide. Shocking footage captured the horror moment Jean-Claude Juncker swung around and nearly hit the Rwandan First Lady with a flame-lit torch. In the video, the European Commission President, 64, lit the Flame of Remembrance before he appeared to try to hand the flaming torch to an official.
But, as he swiftly turned around, Mr Juncker came dangerously close to hitting Jeannette Kagame, wife of Rwandan president Paul. Mr and Mrs Kagame appeared to flinch and dodged backwards as the burning torch came just inches away from hitting them. An official quickly stepped in to ensure the European Commission President did not harm anyone with the large flame. After attending the event, the President of the European Commission wrote on Twitter: “I am moved beyond words at this memorial to tragedy.
Jean-Claude Juncker appeared to almost set the Rwandan First Lady on fire
“It serves as a bleak warning of the worst humanity is capable of. “But through the darkest of days, I remain in awe at the power of regeneration, of this country, and of humankind #Kwibuka25.” The ceremony, which took place on Sunday, started with the flame-lighting memorial, with the fire set to burn for 100 days. President Paul Kagame began a week of solemn ceremonies on Sunday to commemorate the lives of 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutus murdered during the Rwandan genocide, a three-month-killing spree that began 25 years ago.


Nigel Farage claimed he was “absolutely” sure Brexit would be delivered after a Sky News host asked him if “his vision had died”. Mr Farage also said the longer extension allowed the British people go to out and vote in European elections and show their frustration. Speaking on Sky News, host Isabel Webster, said: “Just the very fact we are talking about delays to Brexit, down that in many ways mean that Brexit is over really.
“That it is a pipe dream, that your vision has died now.” Mr Farage replied: “Well, let’s be frank, the Prime Minister and most people in the Houses of Parliament have done their best to try to kill Brexit stone dead. “They have done it by endlessly kicking the can down the road. “But, what they haven’t noticed is the growing anger in this country, and not just among Leave voters, a lot of Remain voters are saying ‘what kind country are we if we don’t keep to our democratic principles’.”
Brexit news: Nigel Farage delivered an epic response after being told his vision had \'died\'
So, do I think Brexit will happen? Absolutely Nigel Farage
He added: “The world is looking on astonished at what has happened to our nation. “So, do I think Brexit will happen? Absolutely, I think Brexit will happen. “I think the genie is out of the bottle, I just fear there are more battles to fight until we get there”. Mr Farage claimed the “one good thing” about extending Article 50 further is “it gives the British people the opportunity on May 23 in a European election to express their view.”
On Friday, Mrs May wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to Article 50 until June 30. The Prime Minister said she will seek to ratify her withdrawal agreement before the European Parliament elections on May 23, but will make "responsible preparations" to take part if that does not prove possible. In her letter, she wrote: "I am writing, therefore, to inform the European Council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty. "The United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June 2019. If the parties are able to ratify before this date, the Government proposes that the period should be terminated early. "The Government will want to agree a timetable for ratification that allows the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union before 23 May 2019 and therefore cancel the European Parliament elections, but will continue to make responsible preparations to hold the elections should this not prove possible." Mrs May said if ongoing talks with Labour do not lead to a "single unified approach soon" then the Government would instead look to establish a "consensus" on options on a future relationship that could be put to the Commons.


The extreme weather will hit the continent on Thursday when two Atlantic fronts will bring heavy rain to Italy and the UK as well as heavy snow to parts of Spain and the Italian Alps. Low pressure will contribute to warm air from north-Africa to reach the continent from the south at the same time, causing a meteorological clash that could cause some severe avalanches. BBC Weather forecaster Susan Powell said: “We’re still looking at a very mobile weather pattern to western European at the moment with areas of low pressure barrelling from the Atlantic pulling a lot of warm air from the south across the Mediterranean.
“Stirring quite a bit of dust across northern Africa. “Some wet weather piling into northern Italy on Thursday, some heavy snow on the Alps and the mild air close by will mean an increased risk of avalanches. “It’s still looking very stormy across the north-west. Some heavy rain as well for Sicily and much of Italy, Sardinia and Corsica. “Rain for northern Portugal and showers feeding across France and across the UK.” On Friday, Spain and Portugal will also experience some heavy snow on their respective northern hills. In the UK, The Met Office has also issued a yellow snow warning for Southern Scotland and Northern England following winds from the Arctic.

The warning also indicated the possibility of travel disruption in this area, however by the evening commute transport should return to normal. Met Office Meteorologist Aidan McGivern said: “Frequent showers across much of the UK with hail, thunder and even some snow mixed in. “It will, of course, be another cold day and there will be more persistent wind and rain with hill snow as we start the day. “Gales across northern and eastern parts of Scotland and you can see this band of wet weather across western parts of Scotland. “Snow especially over the hills but even some snow coming down to lower levels as we start off Wednesday. “Maybe some slushy bits and pieces for Edinburgh and Dundee for example as Scotland has unpleasant conditions.”


The remaining EU27 agreed to give the UK a six-month Brexit extension until the end of October after the Prime Minister asked for a delay to the Article 50 process. Speaking on BBC News, polling expert Sir John Curtice, claimed the European Union has “blinked” by offering Britain the delay. He said: “I think the crucial lesson to take away from what has happened in the last ten days is that first of all what became very clear indeed is that the House of Commons was not willing to contemplate the prospect of no deal.
“I think in truth that has been fairly obvious for some time. “But, I think also what emerged is the European Union also blinked and very clearly decided that leaving without a deal, unless we do prove to be awkward customers, is not in their interest. “Not least because, for the time being at least it is not clear that they would be able to maintain the integrity of the single market and have an open border in Northern Ireland if we were to leave without a deal.” He added: “That does, therefore, mean that crucial crutch to which the ERG, the Brexiteers have stuck by for weeks, which is ‘the default is we leave without a deal’. They should now finally realise that default for all practical purposes does not exist.

“It is then the question of whether or not they will be in a position in the coming weeks to use this six month period to try and force the Prime Minister out.” The remaining 27EU nations offered Mrs May a further six months to ratify or alter her withdrawal deal. Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, the Prime Minister told MPs it was their "national duty" to agree to a Brexit deal. She said: “We need to resolve this. So that we can leave the European Union with a deal as soon as possible. “So that we can avoid having to hold those European Parliamentary elections. And above all, so that we can fulfil the democratic decision of the referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward. “This is our national duty as elected members of this House - and nothing today is more pressing or more vital.”


Economy minister Peter Altmaier, who has been crucial in Germany’s Brexit policymaking, insisted another Article 50 extension should be used to prevent a “big crash”. He said companies with close trading links to Britain could be forced to lay-off staff if there is a hard Brexit. Theresa May is set to ask EU leaders for another Brexit delay at an emergency summit in Brussels next Wednesday.
Reacting, Mr Altmaier said: “The EU and Great Britain can and must prevent the big crash on the last few metres, because thousands of jobs are at stake! If necessary, by a sufficient extension of the withdrawal period.”
He added: “Companies with a high export to Great Britain can generally be affected. I hope, however, that this will not lead to layoffs.”
The German economy minister also revealed that he wants Britain to remain in the customs union in order to keep products cheaper in his own country.
Asked about the risk of Brexit to supermarket prices, he said: “The risk may exist with products imported from the UK, for example car parts and whisky.


Theresa May said she would seek a longer extension past next week to allow talks with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to ensure Britain leaves the EU. But, the move has angered Brexit supporters, with some members of the Conservative Party’s eurosceptic European Research Group claiming it is time for Mrs May to step down. Speaking on Channel 4 News, Conservative Brexiteer Anne Marie Morris claimed Mrs May had “sacrificed” the 17.4million people who voted Leave, and issued a warning to the Prime Minister.
She said: “I think it is the 17.4million people who have been sacrificed because what now is on the table, frankly is simply not Brexit. “It is not delivering a Leave result, because what she is clearly looking at is a deal with Labour which effectively will be a customs union. “This does not deliver Brexit. It is something which is unacceptable. I expected her at this point…to recognise there would not be a deal and we would be better off outside negotiating from a better position.” The Brexiteer added: “We have far from given up and I think you will find there are lots of deeply frustrated Conservatives whatever way they voted on the withdrawal agreement that frankly will never vote for again.

“I would hold your conclusions and wait to see what unrolls and unravels. There are all sorts of moving parts here. It is partly what goes on in Parliament, and remember whatever has to get through both Houses. “It is partly about Europe, and whether or not they will grant an extension. I think she is a bit hopeful to think Brussels will grant her an extension until May 22 to avoid the European elections.” After a mammoth Cabinet meeting discussing the future of Brexit, the Prime Minister reached out to the Labour Party leader to help deliver Britain’s exit from the bloc. Mrs May said: “The ideal outcome of this process would be to agree an approach on a future relationship that delivers on the result of the referendum, that both the leader of the Opposition and I could put to the House for approval and which I could then take to next week\'s European Council.
"However, if we cannot agree on the single unified approach, then we would instead agree a number of options for the future relationship that we could put to the House in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue. "Crucially, the Government stands ready to abide by the decision of the House. But to make this process work, the opposition would need to agree to this too." In response, Mr Corbyn said he would not set any "limits" ahead of the meeting with the Prime Minister, but that his principles ahead of it were to recognise the "needs of the people that elected all MPs to Parliament and the need to avoid the dangers of crashing out". European Research Group (ERG) chairman Mr Rees-Mogg criticised the Prime Minister for planning to collaborate with "a known Marxist" in the Labour leader. He said: "I think getting the support of a known Marxist is not likely to instil confidence in Conservatives. This approach to Government is an unsuccessful one and it also lacks democratic legitimacy.


Jacob Rees-Mogg was quizzed on BBC’s Today programme about retweeting a video of German AfD co-leader Alice Weidel speaking in Germany’s parliament about Brexit. The far-right AfD is Germany’s main opposition party and has campaigned for tougher immigration controls. In response, Jacob Rees-Mogg claimed it was “typical” of the Today programme to ask him about the tweet as he brought up BBC radio presenter James Naughtie who apologised after comparing the European Research Group to France’s National Front.
Speaking on Today, BBC’s Mishal Husain said: “I want to ask you about what you did the other day in retweeting and drawing attention to something which the AfD put out. “I know you have been asked about this quite a few times. And you have said so far that you don’t agree with everything that they stand for but you wanted to draw attention to this. “You have nevertheless chosen to shine a spotlight on a party whose core principles are anti-immigration and anti-Islam, whose leader in the German Parliament views include Germany being overrun by Arabs and Roma. “Is there nothing in that which gives you pause for thought, that at least you should clarify when you put out and say that you don’t support their other beliefs?”
BBC\'s Mishal Husain clashed with Jacob Rees-Mogg on Today
Mr Rees-Mogg replied: “Well, I think this is typical of the BBC’s obsession, dare I say it, the Today programme’s obsession about this. “Mr Naughtie quite shamefully said the other week that the ERG was like the National Front in France. He said it himself, it was his view. He is a BBC person, he is paid by the license fee.” The BBC presenter stepped in demanding Mr Rees-Mogg answer the question, enraging the Conservative Party Brexiteer. The Tory MP said: “I am coming to the question. You must be patient and not interrupt so much because the answer needs to be given properly. “The BBC does have this obsession. What Mr Naughtie said was an outrageous slur and he wasn’t challenged by whoever was interviewing him. That wasn’t raised.”
That to me seems typical of the Today programme’s leftie approach Jacob Rees-Mogg
Ms Husain claimed the remark from Mr Naughtie was not “his view”, before Mr Rees-Mogg added: “Well it was a view he expressed. “When Mr Naughtie quotes someone, and it is not his view, that’s fine. When I quote somebody and it is not my view, that’s a great shock. “That to me seems typical of the Today programme’s leftie approach. An obsession with this issue.” Mr Rees-Mogg posted a video on Sunday of the German AfD co-leader Alice Weidel speaking in Germany\'s parliament. Alongside the video, the Tory MP wrote: "The AfD leader asks \'Is it any wonder the British see bad faith behind every manoeuvre from Brussels?\'"
Labour MP for Tottenham David Lammy responded to the Tweet, claiming Mr Rees-Mogg was “promoting Germany\'s overtly racist party, AfD". He wrote: “Jacob Rees-Mogg promoting Germany\'s overtly racist party, AfD. Our country\'s proudest moment was defeating the far-right. Now we are supposed to sit back while xenophobes, nativists, nationalists & isolationists do their best to tear Europe apart again. We must not let them win.” Speaking on LBC on Monday, Rees-Mogg said: “I\'m not supporting the AfD. But this is a speech in the Bundestag of real importance because it shows a German view of Brexit.” In March, BBC host James Naughtie sparked fury and apologised after likening members of the ERG to France’s National Front.

Brexit will give a push to populism and movements advocating the "disintegration" of the European Union, according to the British historian. Brussels has been warned support for anti-EU parties from across the bloc will see a significant rise at the European parliamentary elections scheduled for May 23-May 26, especially after Britain received a further extension to the Brexit process and is now likely to fight the vote. Speaking to DW, Timothy Garton Ash said: "In my view, the negative consequences for Europe could be even more serious than those for Britain.
"We already see a lot of forces of populism, nationalism and disintegration in different ways in the European Union. "Brexit could give a big, big push to those forces." While the top parties within the European Parliament - the European People\'s Party and the Socialists and Democrats - are expected to win the largest number of seats at the polls, several experts have predicted a surge of support for eurosceptic parties from across the bloc. Investors expect heightened political uncertainty after the May 26 election, in which 705 members of the European Parliament MEPs will be elected, or 751 if Britain fails to leave the EU by May 22 as Theresa May repeatedly pledged. LISTEN HERE: Latest Brexit news from the Express.co.uk Final Countdown podcast
Brexit news: Brussels has been warned of a populist boom at the polls in May
Prof Garton Ash also suggested the delay in the Brexit process could provide proponents of a second referendum with the time needed to hold a new vote a push Britain to stay in the EU. He continued: "That gives the chance for a democratic process which will end up either with a second referendum and Britain may be staying in the EU, which would be a fantastic chance for Europe, or a softer Brexit. "Both those outcomes are less bad for Europe." But Brexiteer Nigel Farage, who last week announced his plan to stand for European election should the UK participate during the extension, warned europhiles like French President Emmanuel Macron to prepare as their "worst fears will come true." Mr Farage said: "If you’re asking for the new crop of MEPs that come here not to vote against your budget or your army or your long term plans - I promise you, if I come back here I’ll vote against every single piece of it.
Brexit news: May could be ousted if she agrees to a soft exit with Labour


Unchecked migration has been blamed for creating ghost towns populated only by the elderly
German chancellor Angela Merkel lobbied hard for mass migration after it became clear in 2015 German industry could grind to a halt without a million-strong injection of cheap labour. But, as the young and ambitious next generation of wealth-creators headed from smaller, poorer states in the east to bigger wealthier nations like the Germany, France and the UK the countries they left behind were left facing economic hardship and financial ruin. Today Romania’s finance minister Eugen Teodorovici again blamed European Union’s unchecked migration policy for a crippling “brain drain” which was crushing his country’s ability to compete and called on the EU to end the brain drain. Express.co.uk highlighted this cruel spin-off of western nations taking eastern Europe’s brightest and best in a series of exclusive articles, written by reporter Zoie O’Brien. We are reprinting a key article below as it remains as relevant – perhaps more relevant – today as it was three years ago. It focuses on Albania – slated to become a member of the EU in 2020 – but the plight of that nation’s towns is mirrored across swathes of eastern Europe. GHOST TOWNS of Albania – the terrible cost of Merkel’s unchecked Euro migration ANGELA Merkel’s EU policy encouraging unchecked mass movement of young people from poor European areas to rich ones is creating GHOST TOWNS across the continent. THE TRUE cost of the EU’s controversial push for unchecked migration was laid bare again today as it became clear rich western nations like Germany were gobbling up the wealth- creating resources of smaller, poorer counties leaving them facing economic ruin. The massive unchecked migration, encouraged by EU policies, is turning already financially weak nations into economic basket cases and leaving a glut of dying towns and villages populated only by old people. In Albania – which is tabled to become an EU member by 2020 - almost ALL young people dream of new lives in Britain or Germany. Many of them are already working here illegally. Germany in particular needs massive inward migration to keep its powerhouse economy moving and, as Express.co.uk reporter Zoie O’Brien discovered as she travelled in Albania, young Albanians are only to happy to provide that labour. But the knock-on effect is that their home nations are left with little or no young labour force to create the wealth for the next generation.
The reality of this situation was made evident to our reporter triggering fears nations like Albania would never recover and have to be propped up by EU cash. Talks between the EU and Albania about the Balkan state joining are at an advanced stage after a meeting last night.
Yes, I want to go to England. I love the UK Albanian teen Visa Llah
Already thousands of Albanian nationals have flocked to the UK in search of better wages and living conditions, and the impact on their struggling economy is being felt across the nation. But, decision makers in Europe are taking their bid to join the union seriously, with some saying they could be a member state as soon as 2020. And thousands are counting on membership, so they can leave their homeland legally. Poverty in the country is described by its people as \'catastrophic\' with huge numbers of unemployed young people. In the last six years, 30 per cent of the 3 million population has left the country and are living abroad.
But the stats paint a false picture according to the younger members of society who admit they work illegally in Europe. And the authorities claim they have no idea how many have left illegally. Visa Llah, 17, dreams of working in the UK as his older brother does now. He said: "The young people here it is difficult for them to find a job. Some of them they just leave Albania and go to wherever they can find a little work. "My friends, they don\'t earn anything. This is our chance to join Europe. We are really trying to get going in the union and really I want to join, I will enjoy it so much. "It will bring more money and more jobs here in Albania. My brother is in London. He really had good work, he is winning money and he really loves the UK.
Publicly displayed obituaries of the elderly mark the walls in Albania
"My cousins, two of them, they went illegally to the UK and now they are trying to arrange their proper papers. "I try to pay attention in my studies and to learn English because it is the most important language in the world. I have lived in Italy for seven years and sometimes I return to Albania. "Yes, I want to go to England. I love the UK. Maybe because my brother is there but I want to go." A Government employee who did not wished to be named revealed the UK is the destination of choice for the young people, claiming thousands will head for Britain rather than easier to reach countries.

He said: "The UK is heaven for Albanians. It is their favourite destination, who cares about Italy and Germany? "They work like dogs and at the end of the month they say it was worth it. Thousands will come. The first wave will be people with family in the UK and the second will be when people raise funds for the trip." The average earnings in Albania are €350 per month. But jobs are rare and rent can be expensive. One man told Express.co.uk he has no choice but to work in Italy for three months at a time.
Many young Albanians already work in the EU illegally
Besi, 28, said: "Young people in Albania are just drinking coffee every day. It is very difficult to find a job here. "If you don\'t have friends with benefits, like business, it is very hard. So we go to Itlay and Germany to earn money and we come home. "The people in the north of Albania and emigrating to the UK. Thousands, because they are very poor. They go to London." Albanians can visit EU countries without a visa for three months at a time legally, since they were given Schengen membership. But this does not entitle them to work.

Arta, 33, who once lived with Albania\'s many street families in ramshackle huts outside of the city centre, moved to Italy with her son for a new life. She said: "Everything is catastrophic. "There is no work. I live in Italy now, when I compare it, the situation here is devastating. Life is so difficult. "Life in Europe to here is incomparable. The people here they really look forward to leaving for another country. They are hoping one day they will leave."


A BBC Question Time audience member snapped at the Remain backing MP claiming a second Brexit vote would be “undemocratic”. Mr Lammy has repeatedly demanded a People’s Vote and delivered a speech at last months anti-Brexit march. Speaking on Question Time, the audience member claimed the UK would be playing a “dangerous game” if it advocated another referendum.
The Question Time audience member said: “Let’s put Brexit aside for one moment. A lot of things that have been said on the panel are sounding slightly undemocratic. “We have had the largest turn out ever in British politics where 17.4million people voted to the simple question of ‘Remain in the EU’ or ‘Leave in the EU’. “The dangerous game we are playing here is you are going against the will of the people and to even mention a second referendum Mr Lammy is just undemocratic.” The Labour MP for Tottenham tried interrupting as he shouted out, “no it’s not”.

The BBC Question Time audience member replied: “Hold on. Hear me out. Hear me out. “If we go to the next election and we are not too happy with the result because Labour got in or another party got in, what do we do? “Oh, ‘let’s put it back to the people’, I am not happy. Best out of three, best out of five, best out of ten.” He added: “Before we had democracy, does anyone recall the system we had before democracy? It was violence.
“The majority rule came in, you accept what the majority say because otherwise, people won’t follow any rules.” This week the Prime Minister has been meeting with the Labour Party leader after Theresa May reached out to Jeremy Corbyn to help try and get Britain’s exit from the EU over the line. The move from the Prime Minister enraged a number of Conservative Party colleagues with some in the Tory party’s European Research Group calling for Mrs May to step down. Discussions around a second Brexit vote have taken place, and Ministers have considered the possibility of giving MPs a vote on holding a referendum on a deal as part of the talks with Labour, the Daily Telegraph reported.


Theresa May is set to meet with the leaders of the European member states in Brussels on Wednesday to seek a further extension to the Brexit process. The Prime Minister is expected to agree to new terms binding Britain to take part in European parliamentary elections in May to get extra time to draft a new withdrawal agreement with the help of the Labour Party. But European Union expert Darren McCaffrey told Euronews the Prime Minister could see the European election turn into a new referendum on Brexit.
Mr McCaffrey said: "Almost certainly, Theresa May is going to commit to European election this week. They will spend tens of millions of pounds on it. "We may as well see those elections turn into a de facto referendum which could cause a great polarisation of views in Britain." The British reporter also suggested Mrs May could still decide to pull out of the election if the Labour Party and her own MPs reach a satisfactory alternative to her Brexit withdrawal agreement before the vote scheduled for May 23-May 26. He continued: "Theresa May’s slim hope is that, somehow, over the next couple of weeks, her and Jeremy Corbyn do agree on a type of customs union and it does get through Parliament and at the last minute she can cancel those elections.

Brexit news: May could agree to take part in the election to then pull out if a deal is agreed
"I think, in reality, they are going to fight that and a lot of people will be angry." A Cabinet Office spokesman announced on Monday the British Government had launched preparations ahead of the May European vote but insisted Mrs May remained eager to reach an agreement by May 22. The spokesman said: "It remains the Government’s intention to leave the EU with a deal and pass the necessary legislation before May 22, so that we do not need to participate in European parliamentary elections,” the spokesman said. "As a responsible Government today we have taken the necessary steps required by law should we have to participate. “The Day of Poll Order provides returning officers with a date to hold potential European Parliamentary elections, but it does not make these elections inevitable as leaving the EU before the date of election automatically removes our obligation to take part.”


Russia and China are the only nations it benefit from Brexit, it has been claimed
Wopke Hoekstra said the only nations to benefit from the UK’s gruelling departure from the EU will be Europe’s biggest rivals Beijing and Moscow, Bloomberg reports. Mr Hoekstra said in an interview in Bucharest: “The only countries that benefit are Russia and China and for us it’s truly tragic that the largest military power is leaving the EU. “But it truly is a tragedy and is bad news for everyone involved.” The news comes after Prime Minister Theresa May sparked outrage asking for yet another Article 50 extension from the EU, this time until June 30.
This followed talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, another act she was widely condemned for by Brexiteers and even Remainers in her Tory Party. The talks came amid her controversial withdrawal agreement being rejected in three shocking meaningful votes in the House of Commons. Despite the UK struggling to leave the EU, the bloc said at the meeting in Romania it was ready for Brexit.
EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs Pierre Moscovici said: “We are prepared also for a no-deal in the field of customs.” He added: “We are ready to re-establish, if needed, controls.” Today, hardline Brexiteers came together in an attempt to block EU legislation should there be a delay to Article 50.

Jacob Rees-Mogg, chair of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, said that “if a long extension leaves us stuck in the EU we should be as difficult as possible”. He suggested: “We could veto any increase in the budget, obstruct the putative EU army and block Mr Macron’s integrationist schemes.” But a spokesperson for the European Commission suggested that the Brexiteer was irrelevant.


The former Ukip now Brexit Party MEP told BBC Radio 5 live the European Parliament elections in May will provide the "best opinion poll" on Brexit since the 2016 referendum. She said: “The main reason why the Brexit Party will be filling a list is that it will be the opportunity to have another poll. The best opinion poll possible.” The eurosceptic party was set up three months ago due to fears over Brexit delays. Last week alone it received “hundreds of thousands of pounds” in donations as it gears up for May’s European elections. The party is set to field 70 candidates across the country.
An insider told the Financial Times: “You’ll be very pleasantly surprised by the sort of people who will be standing to represent the 17.4m people. “The message is going to be ‘deliver Brexit’: these elections are an opportunity to make your voice heard loud and clear to the powers that be.” Last weekend, Nigel Farage - leading the party for the upcoming European elections - revealed the party was selecting representatives from “all walks of life”. Speaking to The Telegraph, he said: “We will have a full slate of candidates featuring people from all walks of life, including business and academia, and all areas of the country.

Seven former Ukip MEPs have already followed Mr Farage and switched to the newly-formed Brexit Party after Ukip lurched to the far-right. He warned Theresa May her decision to reach out to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to come to a cross-party solution to the Brexit impasse will cost the Conservative Party a significant amount of votes at the elections. He wrote: “A caller on LBC told me: ‘That Brexit vote meant a great deal to me, and I think we\'ve been stitched up. The cherry on the cake is Theresa May colluding with comrade Corbyn.’


Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns has claimed the Labour Party leader is unlikely to work with Mrs May as it is “not in his gift”. Speaking on the Today programme, Ms Jenkyns was asked whether she would back Theresa May in a confidence vote. She replied: "Would I vote against her in a no confidence? That takes a lot of thinking about.
"I don\'t want Jeremy Corbyn to get into Number 10. "I firmly believe Jeremy Corbyn is unlikely to work with the Prime Minister because he just wants chaos and he wants to get into Number 10 so it\'s not to his benefit to work with the Prime Minister." Ms Jenkyns added: "I know that if the Withdrawal Agreement comes back I will still vote against it." Theresa May said she would seek a longer extension past next week to allow talks with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to ensure Britain leaves the EU.

But, the move has angered Brexit supporters, with some members of the Conservative Party’s eurosceptic European Research Group claiming it is time for Mrs May to step down. After a mammoth Cabinet meeting discussing the future of Brexit on Tuesday, the Prime Minister reached out to the Labour Party leader to help deliver Britain’s exit from the bloc. Mrs May said: “The ideal outcome of this process would be to agree an approach on a future relationship that delivers on the result of the referendum, that both the leader of the Opposition and I could put to the House for approval and which I could then take to next week\'s European Council. "However, if we cannot agree on the single unified approach, then we would instead agree a number of options for the future relationship that we could put to the House in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue.
"Crucially, the Government stands ready to abide by the decision of the House. But to make this process work, the opposition would need to agree to this too." In response, Mr Corbyn said he would not set any "limits" ahead of the meeting with the Prime Minister, but that his principles ahead of it were to recognise the "needs of the people that elected all MPs to Parliament and the need to avoid the dangers of crashing out". European Research Group (ERG) chairman Mr Rees-Mogg criticised the Prime Minister for planning to collaborate with "a known Marxist" in the Labour leader. He said: "I think getting the support of a known Marxist is not likely to instil confidence in Conservatives. This approach to Government is an unsuccessful one and it also lacks democratic legitimacy.


Theresa May appears set to convince the European Union to agree to a new extension which would once again postpone Brexit past the rescheduled deadline of April 12. With the prospect of Britain being forced to field candidates for the European parliamentary elections scheduled for May, Brexiteer Mark Francois issued a dire warning to Brussels of an incoming onslaught of eurosceptic British politicians winning seats in the European Parliament. Speaking to France 24, the pro-Brexit Tory said: "If there are going to be European elections because we have not left the European Union, then our MEPs will have exactly the same power in Parliament as the MEPs from any other country.
"The public in this country want to leave. If you try and hold us in against out will, we will make life difficult for you. "If there are European elections on May 23, given the growing frustration in Britain, we will probably send you the most eurosceptic group of MEPs you have ever seen." The Prime Minister last week requested a delay of the Brexit deadline to June 30 in a last-ditch attempt to draft a satisfactory withdrawal deal with the help of Jeremy Corbyn. But as EU Council boss Donald Tusk and other EU leaders counteroffered - and appeared to agree to - a longer extension, Mr Francois predicted difficult times ahead for supporters of the European project.

He continued: "They will then probably tie up with other MEPs in the European Parliament who do not entirely believe in the European project in the way President Macron does. "You will end up with a European Parliament largely made up of eurosceptics who, potentially, will make it difficult for the Parliament to advance the project in which Macron so passionately believes." While the top parties within the European Parliament - the European People\'s Party and the Socialists and Democrats - are expected to win the largest number of seats at the polls, several experts have predicted a surge of support for eurosceptic parties from across the bloc. Investors expect heightened political uncertainty after the May 26 election, in which 705 members of the European Parliament MEPs will be elected, or 751 if Britain fails to leave the EU as planned. Before the summit, Mr Tusk warned "neither side should be allowed to feel humiliated at any stage in this difficult process".


Brexit news: Nigel Farage has vowed to recruit household names to his new pro-Brexit party
The former Ukip leader confirmed his “Brexit Party” will be contesting all 73 seats. His bombshell announcement comes amid both the Tories and Labour scrambling to find suitable candidates in time for the May 23 poll. Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph, Mr Farage said candidates would be drawn from “all walks of life” and a number would be household figures.
The Brexit champion added the party was selecting representatives from “all areas of the country” and many of them would hail from non-political backgrounds.
He said: “We will have a full slate of candidates featuring people from all walks of life, including business and academia, and all areas of the country.
“Many have never been party political before and some of them will have instant name recognition.”
His intervention comes just 24 hours after he said he would be running for re-election to the EU Parliament where he has vowed to fight to deliver the result of the 2016 referendum.

Theresa May met with Jeremy Corbyn last week after the Prime Minister reached out to the Labour Party leader to try to deliver Brexit. Mrs May has warned that no Brexit at all remains a possibility and claimed she has done “everything in my power” to persuade Tory MPs and DUP MPs to back her withdrawal agreement, which has been rejected three times. Leading Brexit supporter and Conservative MP for North East Somerset, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has claimed the Prime Minister only has herself to blame for not delivering Brexit.
Jacob Rees-Mogg told Sophy Ridge: “I would question the failure to get enough support for no deal. You are quite right, Parliament has passed motions objecting to a no deal Brexit. “But, it passed two laws which provided for us to leave on March 29 which was subsequently delayed. Law trumps motions and the Prime Minister could have taken us out on March 29, it was the Prime Minister who asked for an extension. “It was the Prime Minister who changed the date by prerogative power from March 29 to April 12. This all rests with her and on her shoulders. “She has made, the Prime Minister Mrs May has made active choices to stop us leaving and she deserves to be held to account for that, because people ought to know the truth of the position, rather than trying to blame everybody else.”

Mrs May has made active choices to stop us leaving and she deserves to be held to account for that Jacob Rees-Mogg
He added: “If the Prime Minister had done what she said in the first place and stuck to the law as set out in two acts we would have left the European Union by now.” The Prime Minister said she had done "everything in my power" to persuade Tory and DUP MPs to back her deal but acknowledged the withdrawal agreement had been rejected by the Commons three times and "there is no sign it can be passed in the near future". She said: ”Because Parliament has made clear it will stop the UK leaving without a deal, we now have a stark choice: leave the European Union with a deal or do not leave at all. "My answer to that is clear: we must deliver Brexit and to do so we must agree a deal. If we cannot secure a majority among Conservative and DUP MPs we have no choice but to reach out across the House of Commons.
"The referendum was not fought along party lines and people I speak to on the doorstep tell me they expect their politicians to work together when the national interest demands it. "The fact is that on Brexit there are areas where the two main parties agree: we both want to end free movement, we both want to leave with a good deal, and we both want to protect jobs. "That is the basis for a compromise that can win a majority in Parliament and winning that majority is the only way to deliver Brexit." On Friday, Mrs May wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to the Article 50 process until June 30.

BBC Weather has warned of a massive cloud system sweeping across the continent keeping temperatures low this weekend. BBC Weather’s Nick Miller claimed many places across Europe do not feel like “spring has sprung” yet with “chilly” conditions present. Miller also warned of “big storms” crashing into eastern parts of Europe this weekend bringing unsettled weather.
According to the latest weather charts, the likelihood of snow falling across central Europe increases on Saturday. BBC Weather forecaster Miller said: “A flow of air coming down from the northeast with high pressure in control. “For many western areas, some decent sunshine to be had, it is still unsettled though across parts of the east of Europe with some big storms in places and a big area of cloud, where it is feeling chilly across central parts of the continent.” He added: “From Turkey across Bulgaria, Romania, into the Balkans, Greece and Italy, we are going to some downpours at times, as we look at the forecast for Friday.

“Plenty of sunshine across Iberia through the western side of France, some cloud building in the British Isles. “Notice temperatures not too special, but particularly where you have got the cloud here. Where you’re clear though, frosty nights to come, not just the next couple of nights, but also through the weekend, as well.” Moving into Saturday, the BBC Weather forecaster added: “Notice no big change in the picture for Saturday. “Still this big area of cloud still the storms the further east you are. And you go a long way south to find temperatures just into the low 20Cs.” Looking at the weather forecast into next week, Miller claimed things would “pick up” temperature wise for Paris and London.
Snow chart shows where is likely to see snowfall this weekend
According to the latest weather charts, parts of Germany are likely to see some snowfall at lower levels over the weekend. It comes as the UK is expected to be hit with wintry showers this weekend as bitterly cold conditions from Scandinavia reach the British Isles. Met Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern warned hail and sleet showers will hit East Anglia and the south-east of England on Saturday and could continue onto Sunday. McGivern said: “On Friday we still have that large area of high pressure from Scandinavia, we still have easterly air floating from the North Sea, one or two showers cropping up across eastern Britain. “Otherwise, it’s another dry and bright day. best of the sunshine to the west with 12C or 13C. 8C or 9C on that chilly North Sea coast. And you can see the extent of that chilly air floating. “These blues coming from Scandinavia. If this was the winter it would be really quite cold but it’s April so things are slowly warming up. Nevertheless, heading into the weekend we actually start to pull in even darker blues.


Theresa May was granted a six-month Brexit extension until the end of October after the Prime Minister originally wrote to the bloc to ask for a delay until June 30. On this week’s Brexit The Final Countdown podcast, presenter Rebecca Hutson was joined by Express.co.uk Head of News Paul Baldwin and Video News Editor Thomas Hunt. Mr Baldwin claimed the Prime Minister would go down “as laughable a figure in history as Neville Chamberlain” as he branded Mrs May’s ‘Brexit means Brexit’ slogan as “utterly meaningless”.
He said: “Neville Chamberlain came back after meeting that nice Mr Hitler with a piece of paper and he landed and said famously, I have in my hand a piece of paper guaranteeing peace in our time. “A few months time the worst war the world has ever seen broke out. Obviously, he got that one wrong. “By the same token, her slogan ‘Brexit means Brexit’, will be as utterly meaningless as ‘peace in our time’. “She will be as laughable a figure in history as Neville Chamberlain because she has misread the entire situation for a really long time.” LISTEN TO BREXIT: THE FINAL COUNTDOWN HERE ON ITUNES

Speaking before Wednesday’s EU summit earlier in the show, Mr Baldwin added: “It makes you wonder what the deal that scrapes through would be, because if she is having to beg the EU for more time. She is having to beg her party to fall in line. She is having to beg Corbyn to also fall in line and stop being mean to her. She has tried begging the DUP to try to uphold the billion-pound bargain. “She has proved she is not great at this, I think. We might admire her stoicism. But, I think even that is wearing a bit thin with even her more ardent supporters. “Another thing, if we get an extension, the chances of her being in power and controlling what happens in that extension are nil.

“The party wants her to go, the country wants her to go, and I bet she wants to go.” The remaining 27 EU nations offered Mrs May a further six months to ratify or alter her withdrawal deal after the Prime Minister asked the bloc for an extension until June 30. Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, the Prime Minister told MPs it was their "national duty" to agree to a Brexit deal. LISTEN TO BREXIT: THE FINAL COUNTDOWN HERE ON ACAST

She said: “We need to resolve this. So that we can leave the European Union with a deal as soon as possible. “So that we can avoid having to hold those European Parliamentary elections. And above all, so that we can fulfil the democratic decision of the referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward. “This is our national duty as elected members of this House - and nothing today is more pressing or more vital.” Responding to the Prime Minister, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: "Yesterday EU leaders agreed to grant the United Kingdom an Article 50 extension until the 31st of October.


The European Parliament’s agriculture committee voted to approve a ban on vegetarian and vegan food products carrying the same names as their meat-based alternatives. Steaks, sausages, escalope and burgers are all set for protected status after the committee voted 80 percent in favour of the changes. The decision will see meat-related terms and names “exclusively for edible parts of the animals”.
The proposal still needs to be approved by the full European Parliament after May’s Euro election, as well as the European Commission and remaining 27 member states. Eric Andrieu, the French socialist MEP tasked with overseeing the legislation, said the bizarre changes are just “common sense”. He said: “It has generated a considerable debate among the political groups and a large majority wanted to clarify things. “Particularly in the light of history, the history we share, you can have a steak or burger, you can’t call it something else.”
EU Parliament agriculture committee vote to rename veggie burgers
He added: “We felt that steak should be kept for real steak with meat and come up with a new moniker for all these products. There is a lot to be done in this front, a lot of creativity will be needed. “People need to know what they are eating. So people who want to eat less meat know what they are eating – people know what is on their plate.” The legislation will likely take years to implement, and that is if it is even considered worthwhile by the EU’s institutions. Mr Andrieu has urged Brussels to “get on with it”.
Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder suggested that the plan was just another “weird” proposal to emerge from the EU Parliament’s agriculture committee. She said: “This is just an Agricultural committee decision. They come out with a fair amount of bizarre proposals. “It’s highly unlikely this decision will pass the full Parliament.” Britain will be forced to follow EU guidelines on food labelling and safety even after Brexit.


In the approach to May’s European elections, the leader of Italy’s League party defiantly kicked off his election campaign with a pledge to forge a new future of Europe and fight back against the Brussels bureaucrats and bankers who have threatened the European dream. Speaking from Milan along with the leaders of the Danish People’s Party, The Finns Party and Alternative for Germany, Mr Salvini said: “We are working for a new European dream to many citizens. To many citizens and people today, the EU is a nightmare and not a dream.
We want to forge a new future and start the journey together which will rescue Europe Matteo Salvini
“We are working to take labour, family and safety back into the centre. We are talking about environmental protections, the future of younger generations. “We try to do it with alternative movements after those of which have been in the power over the last decades, the Socialist and Democrats with their alliance have led us to uncertainty, frictions and a lack of safety. “This is an alliance looking for the future. We start today. This family is going to get larger, including movements we have never been operating in the past.” Mr Salvini said the parties have clear differences in their languages, history and culture but all want to improve on employment, economic wealth and respect of identities across the continent.

He added: “These are all targets which have been betrayed over the last few years by European democracies. “Europe makes sense if it acknowledges different cultures and identities. The EU cannot be a single thought based on finance and business. “That’s not a dream. That’s a nightmare we are living in.” The Italian deputy said the ultimate goal of the alliance is to be a “changing force” in Europe, adding: “To bring new life, new blood, new hope, new dreams. Some topics are common like the cultural boundaries, fighting against terrorist, extremism. “We want to forge a new future and start the journey together which will rescue Europe because the European dream is being threatened by bureaucrats, bankers governing Europe. They have been governing Europe for too long.”
EU elections: AfD chairman says new group called European Alliance for People and Nations
Anders Vistisen, of the Dansk Folkeparti, said the alliance is about trying to respect differences between member states. He added: “Therefore, this project is not about finding a common foreign policy, it’s not about finding a common policy on all details, it is about defending the national state rights to find their own paths and the path that is right for the people that live in these countries. “And this is what we will endeavour to trying to deliver after the European elections. We know that there is a lot of interest to do this. In many ways, this is a symbolic panel. “It symbolises the unity belonging now to truly different political fractions. Lastly, Mr Vistisen warned: “If we let our opponents divide us we will see more divisions, less security and we will see the multiculturalism and the identity policies of Europe taking over the national identities of the 27 European countries.”
AfD chairman Jörg Meuthen revealed the new alliance would be called the European Alliance for People and Nations and would involve at least 10 parties. Mr Meuthen told reporters: “We want to reform the European Union and the European Parliament, without destroying them. We want to bring radical change.” Olli Kotro, of the Finns Party, also warned Emmanuel Macron’s dreams of further integration in Europe could ultimately leave members states having no voice. He said: “It’s very important that the sovereignty of member states is respected. “The EU is developing more and more and is becoming a United States of Europe.

Germany news: Exports and imports fell more than expected in February
The largest economy in Europe has been dented in recent months by a slowing world economy, trade disputes and Brexit uncertainty. The latest in a string of poor data to come out of Berlin, the Federal Statistics Office said seasonally adjusted exports were down by 1.3 percent on the month. This marks the biggest drop in 12 months, while imports fell 1.6 percent. The trade surplus edged up to €18.7 billion (£16.1 billion) from a revised 18.6 billion euros the previous month.
Germany PLUNGED into financial gloom - \'\'Long-term upswing is OVER\'
Carsten Brzeski from ING said: “There simply seem to be too many crises in global trade for the German export sector to defy all of them at the same time.”
The German economy has come under the radar in recent months on fears of a long-term expansion coming to an end, leading to the top economic institutes in the country slashing their growth forecast for 2019.
In a damning report released last week, the growth forecast was downgraded to 0.8 percent from a previous estimate of 1.9 percent.
The report warned how a hard Brexit, if Britain should leave the European Union with a deal in place, would further damped the prospects of the German economy.


With May’s vote just weeks away, experts say anti-EU parties have a chance to impact the future of the European Union if they join forces to work together. Far-right leaders share the broad ideological goals of curbing the EU\'s perceived liberal course and returning power to the member states\' capitals. But they differ in other areas. Investors expect heightened political uncertainty after the May 26 election, in which 705 members of the European Parliament MEPs will be elected, or 751 if Britain fails to leave the EU as planned.
General dissatisfaction over slow economic growth, security threats posed by Islamist militants and a backlash against migration across open EU borders have boosted support for eurosceptic nationalists in many member states. Susi Dennison, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said: "There is a growing confidence of voters to go against the norm. "The \'anti- forces\' are much more motivated right now than the pro-Europeans." Their gains and Brexit will mean a shake-up of the pan-national groups created by parties in the EU parliament, whose main role is checking and amending EU laws drawn up by the executive European Commission. Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini will launch his election campaign tomorrow in Milan, with a call to other eurosceptic parties across the continent to join forces with his League to form a new alliance within Brussels.
The EU elections are set to see a rise in eurosceptic parties, experts say
Buoyed by his own success and voter fatigue with mainstream parties, Salvini is trying to build bridges with the likes of French far-right leader Marine Le Pen and Austrian far-right politician Heinz-Christian Strache the May 26 vote. With the two biggest political blocs expected to lose their combined majority, he and other far-right leaders hope to form an opposition, eurosceptic alliance with enough seats in the assembly to block or hold up legislation. Salvini\'s foreign affairs advisor Marco Zanni said: "Our idea is to come together ... into a new party that better reflects the eurosceptical views that unite us. "Now is our chance to unite forces once and for all." Salvini\'s anti-immigrant League is forecast to more than quadruple its representation in the EU assembly with 27 seats.
Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk
Along with the projected rise for Le Pen\'s National Rally and Strache\'s Freedom Party of Austria, which is in a coalition government with Strache as vice-chancellor, the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) group to which they belong could be boosted to 61 seats from 37. Salvini, whose party co-rules Italy, wants to embrace other leaders whose parties are in rival groups. Even if parties do not come together, their presence in the European Parliament could create cracks in the EU. Mr Zanni of Salvini\'s League said there will be greater cooperation to try to influence or thwart EU policy. Ms Dennison added: "The risk is longer-term paralysis, that over time will erode the idea of EU as an effective actor." Duncan McDonnell, Professor of Politics in the School of Government and International Relations at Griffith University said the far-right increasingly saw itself as "part of a new wave".

The former Ukip now Brexit Party MEP told BBC Radio 5 live the European Parliament elections in May will provide the "best opinion poll" on Brexit since the 2016 referendum. She said: “The main reason why the Brexit Party will be filling a list is that it will be the opportunity to have another poll. The best opinion poll possible.” The eurosceptic party was set up three months ago due to fears over Brexit delays. Last week alone it received “hundreds of thousands of pounds” in donations as it gears up for May’s European elections. The party is set to field 70 candidates across the country.
An insider told the Financial Times: “You’ll be very pleasantly surprised by the sort of people who will be standing to represent the 17.4m people. “The message is going to be ‘deliver Brexit’: these elections are an opportunity to make your voice heard loud and clear to the powers that be.” Last weekend, Nigel Farage - leading the party for the upcoming European elections - revealed the party was selecting representatives from “all walks of life”. Speaking to The Telegraph, he said: “We will have a full slate of candidates featuring people from all walks of life, including business and academia, and all areas of the country.

Seven former Ukip MEPs have already followed Mr Farage and switched to the newly-formed Brexit Party after Ukip lurched to the far-right. He warned Theresa May her decision to reach out to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to come to a cross-party solution to the Brexit impasse will cost the Conservative Party a significant amount of votes at the elections. He wrote: “A caller on LBC told me: ‘That Brexit vote meant a great deal to me, and I think we\'ve been stitched up. The cherry on the cake is Theresa May colluding with comrade Corbyn.’


Opening his radio show, leading Brexit supporter and Conservative MP Nigel Farage delivered a passionate speech about Britain still being a member of the EU. On Friday the Prime Minister’s withdrawal agreement was defeated in the House of Commons and MPs will vote on amendments on Monday to try to find a solution moving forward. Speaking on his LBC show, Mr Farage claimed it was “one of the saddest” episodes in Britain’s history that the UK was still a member of the Brussels bloc.
He said: “Good morning, it is Sunday, March 31 2019. Guess what? We are still members of the European Union. Despite the fact, we were supposed to be leaving. “The Prime Minister telling us over 100 times we would leave. 500 MPs voting for us to leave on that day, with or without a deal. “I have to say, for me, I think this is one of the saddest, worst episodes in the history of our country. “I fear that our democracy is dying and our faith in our whole electoral system, our governmental system, I think it is a bad moment.”

After her plan was rejected by MPs, by 344 votes to 286, the Prime Minister warned she feared “we are reaching the limits of this process in this House”. Theresa May said: “This House has rejected no deal. It has rejected no Brexit. On Wednesday it rejected all the variations of the deal on the table. “And today it has rejected approving the withdrawal agreement alone and continuing a process on the future. “This Government will continue to press the case for the orderly Brexit that the result of the referendum demands."


All alternative Brexit options were rejected in the Commons by MPs on Monday night as MPs voted to try to find an alternative solution to the Brexit stalemate. BBC’s Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg has claimed the Remainer sects within the Commons have failed in trying to “sit down and make peace” as they found to find a majority on any alternative. Kuenssberg also claimed a Remainer cabinet minister was “hopping mad” with the Scottish National Party as they abstained from voting on the customs union amendment.
The BBC\'s Political Editor said: “The Government minister I bumped into was absolutely hopping mad that the SNP didn’t come over to the customs union. “He said ‘I can’t believe it, this is our way out’. This is someone who is a soft Brexiteer, who is a strong Remainer but wants a Brexit compromise. “Those Remain forces, former Remainer forces, have all been working ahead together behind the scenes and he was furious. “Lots of different factions. Lots of different tribes who haven’t been willing to sit down and make peace.”

She added: “Interestingly even the People’s Vote guys, even the Independent Group, quite of lot of acid commentary tonight that the new Independent Group that wanted a new type of politics are proving to be just as unwilling to comprise as some of those from the more traditional parts.” BBC’s Europe Editor Katya Adler claimed all Remainer groups within the Commons were trying to be the “last one standing” in a bid to get their preferred option over the line. She added: “Isn’t it just that everybody still just thinks if they are the last ones standing they will win out in the end. “So they are just unwilling to compromise because they just think, ‘well everybody else will just compromise and we will just stick to our guns and we will get what we want’. “From here it feels like the EU, they cannot believe it again tonight to be honest.”
The Prime Minister and her senior ministers will meet on Tuesday morning after MPs failed to find a majority for any Brexit alternative. A call for a customs union with the EU was rejected by just three votes, while a demand for a second referendum was defeated by 12 and a Norway-style deal put forward by Nick Boles by 21. Following the defeat of his amendment, Mr Boles immediately declared that he would no longer sit as a Conservative MP, blaming the party for refusing to compromise on a means of leaving the European Union. A statement from Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay read: “This is the second time the House has considered a wide variety of options for a way forward, it has once again failed to find clear majority for any of the options. “And yet the result of the House\'s decision on Friday not to endorse the Withdrawal Agreement means that the default legal position is that the UK will leave the EU in just 11 days\' time. “To secure any further extension, the Government will have to put forward a credible proposition to the EU as to what we will do with that extra time. This House has continuously rejected leaving without a deal, just as it has rejected not leaving at all. Therefore the only option is to find a way through which allows the UK to leave with a deal.


In the approach to May’s European elections, the leader of Italy’s League party defiantly kicked off his election campaign with a pledge to forge a new future of Europe and fight back against the Brussels bureaucrats and bankers who have threatened the European dream. Speaking from Milan along with the leaders of the Danish People’s Party, The Finns Party and Alternative for Germany, Mr Salvini said: “We are working for a new European dream to many citizens. To many citizens and people today, the EU is a nightmare and not a dream.
We want to forge a new future and start the journey together which will rescue Europe Matteo Salvini
“We are working to take labour, family and safety back into the centre. We are talking about environmental protections, the future of younger generations. “We try to do it with alternative movements after those of which have been in the power over the last decades, the Socialist and Democrats with their alliance have led us to uncertainty, frictions and a lack of safety. “This is an alliance looking for the future. We start today. This family is going to get larger, including movements we have never been operating in the past.” Mr Salvini said the parties have clear differences in their languages, history and culture but all want to improve on employment, economic wealth and respect of identities across the continent.

He added: “These are all targets which have been betrayed over the last few years by European democracies. “Europe makes sense if it acknowledges different cultures and identities. The EU cannot be a single thought based on finance and business. “That’s not a dream. That’s a nightmare we are living in.” The Italian deputy said the ultimate goal of the alliance is to be a “changing force” in Europe, adding: “To bring new life, new blood, new hope, new dreams. Some topics are common like the cultural boundaries, fighting against terrorist, extremism. “We want to forge a new future and start the journey together which will rescue Europe because the European dream is being threatened by bureaucrats, bankers governing Europe. They have been governing Europe for too long.”
EU elections: AfD chairman says new group called European Alliance for People and Nations
AfD chairman Jörg Meuthen revealed the new alliance would be called the European Alliance for People and Nations and would involve at least 10 parties. Mr Meuthen told reporters: “We want to reform the European Union and the European Parliament, without destroying them. We want to bring radical change.” Olli Kotro, of the Finns Party, also warned Emmanuel Macron’s dreams of further integration in Europe could ultimately leave members states having no voice. He said: “It’s very important that the sovereignty of member states is respected. “The EU is developing more and more and is becoming a United States of Europe.


BBC Weather forecaster Darren Bett warned there could be “dangerous travelling conditions” in Finland as snow continues to fall. The BBC’s Ben Rich said an area of high pressure will take charge for most of northern Europe on Tuesday, which will offer fine and settled weather for much of Scandinavia, the British Isles and into northern Germany. But the BBC Weather forecaster warned that as soon as the weather front moves out cooler air will push in and cause temperatures to plummet.
Low pressure spinning across the north east of Europe, feeding some snow one again across Finland BBC Weather
Mr Rich said: “We do have one area of low pressure spinning across the northeast of Europe, feeding some snow one again across Finland. “On the eastern flank of that low, some pretty warm air wafting its way northwards into the likes of Moscow. “Now, further south, things generally very unsettled. Lots of showers and thunderstorms flinging themselves through the Mediterranean, across the Balkans, parts of Greece and Turkey. “Lots of heavy downpours across Italy on Wednesday. Perhaps not as many showers at this stage across southern Spain and the southern half of Portugal.
BBC Weather: Snow set to strike in Finland
“A scattering of downpours across France and into the south of Germany. Northern Germany largely dry.” Temperatures will drop to the single digits in Berlin on Wednesday as a thick band of cloud covers the city. The BBC forecaster added: “That sort of weather continues on into Thursday. The snow perhaps starting to ease across Finland by this stage. Lots of showers still across central and eastern parts of the Mediterranean. “In Madrid, these temperatures recovering over the next few days and getting up to around 20C on Saturday.


Nigel Dodds, the DUP’s Commons leader, claimed the European Union had “backed down” as they faced the prospect of Brexit Britain leaving the bloc without a deal. Mr Dodds called for the Prime Minister to learn the no deal “lesson” after the European Union granted Britain another Article 50 extension until the end of October. The DUP’s deputy leader said: “Up until yesterday the EU were saying try clearly it wouldn’t grant an extension unless there was a credible plan, an election, a referendum or respect of getting a withdrawal agreement through soon, it wouldn’t grant an extension. And if it did there would be stringent conditions.
“In fact, neither of those were held to by the European Union. Because when they were faced with the unpalatable choice of a no deal, they backed down. “Will the Prime Minister learn the lesson of that. She continues to reiterate what the EU have said about the withdrawal agreement and praise her withdrawal agreement. “She and the rest of the frontbench voted for changes to the backstop of the withdrawal agreement and the Attorney General in his devastating critique of it said it hadn’t changed the fundamentals of what was agreed. “Can the Prime Minister please examine where she is going with this. Learn the lessons and come back with something that can actually get a majority in this House.”

When they were faced with the unpalatable choice of a no deal, they backed down Nigel Dodds
Mrs May replied: “We have consistently sought to change the withdrawal agreement, in particular, to change the backstop, he will know full well we have argued on many occasions for a time limit or a unilateral exit clause or the replacement by alternative arrangements before the withdrawal agreement was originally agreed in November. The Government pushed consistently for an exit clause to the backstop, but the EU did not agree to it then. “After the first meaningful vote we raised the issue again, and we sought to change the withdrawal agreement, and pushed for it to be replaced by alternative arrangements. “On March 11 we had an exchange of letters between myself and the Presidents of the Commission and the EU Council in January. On March 11 in Strasbourg the President of the European Commission and I agreed to a package which means the EU cannot try to trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely, it is explicitly a breach of the legally binding commitments we have made if they do so. “And there is a legal commitment that both parties aim to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by December 2020.”
The remaining 27EU nations offered Theresa May a further six months to ratify or alter her withdrawal deal after the Prime Minister asked the bloc for an extension until June 30. Speaking in the House of Commons, the Prime Minister told MPs it was their "national duty" to agree to a Brexit deal. She said: “We need to resolve this. So that we can leave the European Union with a deal as soon as possible. “So that we can avoid having to hold those European Parliamentary elections. And above all, so that we can fulfil the democratic decision of the “Referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward.


Diane Abbott refused to say whether Brits having the final say on any Brexit deal had to be the outcome of EU talks with the Government as she was pressed by a BBC host. The Labour Party has been engaged in negotiations with the Government this week after Theresa May reached out to Jeremy Corbyn to try to get Brexit over the line, which sparked fury among many in the Conservative Party. Speaking on BBC’s Today programme, the shadow home secretary was quizzed over whether a second Brexit vote was a “necessity” of the negotiations with the Government, before she admitted Leave would likely win again.
Ms Abbott said: “The Labour Party is united on the fact a People’s Vote is still on the table, that is the conference position.” Pressed by Webb on whether any agreement with the Government must have a second vote attached to it, Ms Abbott said: "We are not saying anything definitively but we have a position." The BBC host snapped back: “Hold on a second, if you had a position you would be saying it definitively wouldn’t you? “Lots of your support, I imagine quite a lot of people listening now, would be saying, ‘we need another vote and we need Labour, which is overwhelmingly supported actually by people who would like another opportunity to say they want to remain in the EU, we need to have an opportunity to say that’.”
Brexit news: Diane Abbott clashed with BBC\'s Justin Webb
Ms Abbott replied: “People’s Vote was part of the policy package we passed at conference. Of course, you can have different types of People’s Vote, you can have what is called a confirmatory ballot, where you get a deal and you put it back to the people. That’s a standard trade union process, you negotiate a deal, then you bring it back to your members for a vote. “Or you could have a People’s Vote if you thought it was the only way to stop a no deal Brexit, but the principle of the Labour Party supports some kind of People’s Vote was set out in the policy agreed at conference.” The BBC host demanded to know if the British people having another vote after negotiations was a “red line”. Ms Abbott said Labour was a “member led party and the members are being clear on this question of some kind of People’s Vote, so it has to be part of our negotiations with the Government.” The BBC host asked whether it “had to be part of the outcome”, to which the Labour frontbencher replied: “It has to be part of our negotiations.”
We are not saying anything definitively but we have a position Diane Abbott
Webb said: “Hold on a minute Diane, that’s crazy, isn’t it? I understand you go in with various things, but what I am trying to get from you, because it is so important to so many of your supporters, is another referendum an absolute necessity of doing a deal with the Government or is it something that you might say ‘no it’s okay it’s a good enough deal, we will just go with it’.” Ms Abbott replied: “I have said to you we have not gone into these negotiations being dogmatic we have gone into these talks with a preexisting position, and there are different types of People’s Vote that you can have. “There is no question of the Labour Party leadership dismissing the views of the party as expressed at party conference.” Labour’s shadow home secretary said she thought a People’s Vote “has its difficulties” claiming that “if we had that vote tomorrow I believe Leave would win.” During the interview, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: "We engaged in these talks in good faith. Keir Starmer has written to the Government to say he wants to continue the talks, so in that sense, they are going on. There is concern that the Government doesn\'t want to alter the political declaration.” She added: "There\'s no question that the mess we are in is Theresa May\'s mess, even Tory MPs accept that. The Labour Party has stepped up, we want to help. “We are engaged in these talks in good faith but the Government perhaps has to show a little more flexibility than it seems to have done so far."


John Elliott, the founder of the manufacturer of washing machines and dehumidifiers in the UK, has called for Britain to leave the European Union with no deal and “play hard” in order to get a pragmatic response from the Brussels bloc. Speaking to BBC 5 Live’s Emma Barnett, Mr Elliott said: “I think the problem with the EU is it is not a very good organisation – they add nothing but cost and bureaucracy. So, that’s why, I think, the European Union will eventually fail.”
As long as they think that they will play hard, as soon as we are out they will become more pragmatic John Elliott
The multi-millionaire businessman said there are “lots of mistakes” in the claims made surrounding a no deal Brexit, adding: “Remember, the EU want Brexit to fail and we are giving them hope for that as well. “So, as long as they think that they will play hard, as soon as we are out they will become more pragmatic.” Mr Elliott insisted the EU “adds nothing but cost” and said it is best for Britain to walk away from the Brussels bloc and set its own tariffs. If the UK left the EU without an arrangement in place it would automatically trade under WTO rules.

The Brexiteer said Britain does not need to stay close to the Union and added: “We joined the common market where we import more than we export. And we pay for money that doesn’t exist.” He ridiculed the negative sentiment from large businesses surrounding Brexit and said: “It’s the big organisations because they like the EU, don’t they? "It’s more important what is right for the country than individual businesses. “We will survive. It’s what is right for the country – that is more important than what is right for businesses. Businesses serve the people and not the other way around.”


Theresa May travelled to Brussels on Wednesday to meet with EU leaders after she requested an extension to Britain’s departure from the Brussels bloc. But, Alex Deane a Conservative Party political commentator, has called for Mrs May to “resurrect” her demand of no deal is better than a bad Brexit deal. He told Sky News: “On the Parliamentary side, it would be to resurrect the prospect of no deal.
“For some time our Prime Minister rightly said that no deal is better than a bad deal. “It is the most efficient weapon in her arsenal, the best club in the bag for our side of negotiations, we should never let that prospect go.” The political commentator also called for the EU to take a fresh look at the controversial backstop mechanism within the withdrawal agreement, which posed a major issue for some pro-Brexit Conservative MPs. As she arrived at the EU summit, Mrs May was asked if she was “embarrassed” about having to ask for an extension.

The Prime Minister said: “I know many people will be frustrated that the summit is taking place at all because the UK should have left the EU by now. “I greatly regret the fact that Parliament has not been able to pass a deal that would enable us to leave in a smooth and orderly way.” She added: “But, I and the Government continue to work to find a way forward. We have been talking with the opposition and there have been serious constructive talks. They will continue tomorrow. “The purpose of this summit is to agree to an extension which gives us more time to agree to a deal to enable us to leave the EU in that smooth and orderly way.
“What matters I think is that I have asked for an extension to June 30, but what is important is that any extension enables us to leave at the point of which we ratify the withdrawal agreement. So we could leave on the 22 May and start to build our brighter future.” Speaking in Brussels, EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that any extension to the Article 50 process “must serve a purpose”. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte opened up on the division among the EU27 over the length of any extension. He told reporters: “It is very well possible that we will decide to prevent a no deal Brexit tonight. "We will have several important discussions, on how long will an extension be and what conditions will be attached to it. "There are differing opinions about that. We need to make sure that the EU can function, that all member states cooperate loyally."


All alternative Brexit options were rejected in the Commons by MPs on Monday night as MPs voted to try to find an alternative solution to the Brexit stalemate. BBC’s Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg has claimed the Remainer sects within the Commons have failed in trying to “sit down and make peace” as they found to find a majority on any alternative. Kuenssberg also claimed a Remainer cabinet minister was “hopping mad” with the Scottish National Party as they abstained from voting on the customs union amendment.
The BBC\'s Political Editor said: “The Government minister I bumped into was absolutely hopping mad that the SNP didn’t come over to the customs union. “He said ‘I can’t believe it, this is our way out’. This is someone who is a soft Brexiteer, who is a strong Remainer but wants a Brexit compromise. “Those Remain forces, former Remainer forces, have all been working ahead together behind the scenes and he was furious. “Lots of different factions. Lots of different tribes who haven’t been willing to sit down and make peace.”

She added: “Interestingly even the People’s Vote guys, even the Independent Group, quite of lot of acid commentary tonight that the new Independent Group that wanted a new type of politics are proving to be just as unwilling to comprise as some of those from the more traditional parts.” BBC’s Europe Editor Katya Adler claimed all Remainer groups within the Commons were trying to be the “last one standing” in a bid to get their preferred option over the line. She added: “Isn’t it just that everybody still just thinks if they are the last ones standing they will win out in the end. “So they are just unwilling to compromise because they just think, ‘well everybody else will just compromise and we will just stick to our guns and we will get what we want’. “From here it feels like the EU, they cannot believe it again tonight to be honest.”
The Prime Minister and her senior ministers will meet on Tuesday morning after MPs failed to find a majority for any Brexit alternative.

Prime Minister Theresa May travelled to Brussels on Wednesday to meet with EU leaders after she requested an extension to Britain’s departure from the Brussels bloc. Mrs May was filmed joking with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and president of the European Council Donald Tusk just moments before delivering a Brexit speech to her EU counterparts. In the footage, the Prime Minister and Mrs Merkel both begin laughing at something on a tablet.
The pair then share the joke with EU officials and then the president of the European Council, before Mr Tusk is seen bursting out with laughter. It is unclear what the Prime Minister was discussing with Ms Merkel and Mr Tusk. As she arrived at the EU summit, Mrs May was asked if she was “embarrassed” about having to ask for an extension. The Prime Minister said: “I know many people will be frustrated that the summit is taking place at all because the UK should have left the EU by now.

The Independent Group MP got into a fiery debate as he called for Britain to have a so-called ‘People’s Vote’ on the final Brexit deal. The heated exchange began when the Sky News host said: “Interestingly, you spoke about an extreme Brexit. Well, a while ago I was talking to Sir Bernard Jenkin and he said to me that 90 percent of people who voted Leave in the 2016 referendum would prefer the UK to leave on no deal.
“So, he is set in his position and that’s not going to move. You are stuck in your position where you are calling for a People’s Vote. So, we remain at this impasse – we are not moving forwards on this.”
In response, Mr Umunna said Bernard Jenkin was one of the “architects of this mess”, adding: “He was a leading figure who created the Vote Leave campaign.”
But the Sky News host quickly fired back and said: “He could accuse you of being an architect for this mess because of the fact that you were calling for a People’s Vote and we have already had a referendum.”
Mr Umunna replied and claimed Britain does not have a People’s Vote so it is not “causing the chaos we find ourselves in now”.


The pair clashed on Euronews as they debated Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini\'s announcement of a united anti-establishment eurosceptic cross-groups coalition ahead of the European Parliament elections in May. Estonian MEP Indrek Tarand claimed he did not fear the potential threat posed by populist parties gaining momentum across the Brussels bloc ahead of the elections and branded their voters "stupid".
He said: “In a democracy people have the right to be stupid and vote for all sorts of extremist approaches, disruptive, destructing. “They have that right. But what I say is that the European Parliament will be rhetorically more interesting because of all those colourful people that will be elected but they won’t construct anything. “They will make a lot of noise like Nigel Farage has been doing but we don’t have Brexit yet. “As long as it’s a democratic debate based on rules, it’s okay. “They have their argument, I have mine. As soon as somebody starts to promote violence with some kind of violent takeover and anti-constitutional movement, we will have to look at it for what it is.”
EU news: Indrek Tarand and Gerold Annemans clash over new EU populist alliance agenda
The people who vote for us are not stupid. On the contrary, they are very smart Gerold Annemans MEP
But Belgian ENF MEP Gerold Annemans blasted the Greens politician as he defended his electorate and Matteo Salvini\'s political agenda. He said: “I don’t know about Estonia, but none of the parties of ENF are promoting violence whatsoever or any violent takeover. “And none of our electorates is stupid. The people who vote for us are not stupid. On the contrary, they are very smart, they see that the European Union evolved in a way that is not wishful and they should have another kind of European cooperation. “Just putting that on the table cannot be stupid. This is a smart idea because if we go on with the bulldozers of the European Union, we will crash European cooperation.” With the two biggest political blocs expected to lose their combined majority, Mr Salvini and other far-right leaders hope to form an opposition, eurosceptic alliance with enough seats in the assembly to block or hold up legislation.


The EU official will “take stock of the developments in London” during several meetings in Dublin. He will also meet with Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, and finance minister Paschal Donohue. Britain could leave the EU without a deal as early as Friday if leaders fail to agree another Brexit extension when they meet on Wednesday.
The meetings will focus on preparations for emergency European Council summit and no deal plans for the Irish border, according to a European Commission spokesman. They said: “This is part of his frequent visits to the 27 capitals, ahead of the European Council, of course. “This visit reflect the ongoing and intensive discussions on the planning of no-deal scenarios, and he’s accompanied by Commission officials to cover all of the Article 50 state of play.” Ahead of Mr Barnier’s Dublin trip, Mr Coveney said the visit represents the Commission and EU’s ongoing show of “solidarity” with Ireland.
Michel Barnier to hold no-deal Brexit talks with Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar today
Mr Coveney said: “What he will want to do first of all is show solidarity with Ireland. “But also I think he’ll want a detailed conversation in terms of Ireland’s perspective on the most recent ask from the prime minister for an extension of time. “Ireland is, of course, willing to give the process more time, but we, like many other EU member states, will want to see a plan to go with that to show that there is a proposed way of finding a majority of support in Westminster for a way forward.” Mr Varadkar and Mr Barnier are expected to host a joint press event after their meeting this afternoon.
Theresa May last week requested to delay Brexit until June 30 in order to give her more time to win the support of MPs for her deal. Mr Coveney said he could support a short or long extension, he said: ‘We’re open to either in truth. “As long as there is a credible plan to get a deal across the line, then I think European leaders will look at an extension positively. “But they will need to see a credible plan to go with the ask.” Mrs May will also hold her own pre-summit meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday.
Over the weekend, Mr Varadkar attempted to address the possibility of France vetoing another extension of the EU’s Article 50 exit clause. The Irish leader said he does not believe another member state would veto the delay as “they would never be forgiven”. Luxembourg’s foreign minister Jean Asselborn suggested the Prime Minister was to blame for the impending no-deal Brexit. He told reporters: “The British hard turned a deal into a no deal. And now they want to turn the no deal into a deal.


The European Parliament’s agriculture committee voted to approve a ban on vegetarian and vegan food products carrying the same names as their meat-based alternatives. Steaks, sausages, escalope and burgers are all set for protected status after the committee voted 80 percent in favour of the changes. The decision will see meat-related terms and names “exclusively for edible parts of the animals”.
The proposal still needs to be approved by the full European Parliament after May’s Euro election, as well as the European Commission and remaining 27 member states. Eric Andrieu, the French socialist MEP tasked with overseeing the legislation, said the bizarre changes are just “common sense”. He said: “It has generated a considerable debate among the political groups and a large majority wanted to clarify things. “Particularly in the light of history, the history we share, you can have a steak or burger, you can’t call it something else.”
EU Parliament agriculture committee vote to rename veggie burgers
He added: “We felt that steak should be kept for real steak with meat and come up with a new moniker for all these products. There is a lot to be done in this front, a lot of creativity will be needed. “People need to know what they are eating. So people who want to eat less meat know what they are eating – people know what is on their plate.” The legislation will likely take years to implement, and that is if it is even considered worthwhile by the EU’s institutions. Mr Andrieu has urged Brussels to “get on with it”.
Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder suggested that the plan was just another “weird” proposal to emerge from the EU Parliament’s agriculture committee. She said: “This is just an Agricultural committee decision. They come out with a fair amount of bizarre proposals. “It’s highly unlikely this decision will pass the full Parliament.” Britain will be forced to follow EU guidelines on food labelling and safety even after Brexit.


Mr Juncker told reporters he is a “bit worried” about the state of Italy’s economy after several high-profile clashes with the country’s populist government over its finances. The 64-year-old Commission president said he wanted to see more action from Rome to boost financial growth. He met with Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte, who has previously blamed Brussels for Italy’s poor fiscal economy.
In a joint press conference after their discussions, Mr Juncker said: “I am a bit worried to see that the Italian economy hasn’t stopped regressing. “I would like the Italian authorities to make extra efforts to maintain growth.” On Monday the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development warned Italy’s struggling economy and challenging budget require urgency measures to take control of Rome’s poor finances and lower public debt. Mr Conte defending his government, a coalition comprised of right-wing party League and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, insisting Rome is sticking to “expansive and responsible” policies.

He instead blamed “the slowdown of the global economy” on a global trade war, which hampering European manufacturers. The Italian prime minister said: “To react to this, European Union member states that have more fiscal room for manoeuvre should use it to boost internal demand through investment.” Italy has been hunting foreign investment from China in recent weeks, much to the annoyance of Germany and China. Mr Juncker failed to be drawn into the row ahead of an EU-China summit in Brussels next week.


The remaining EU27 agreed to give the UK a six-month Brexit extension until the end of October after the Prime Minister asked for a delay to the Article 50 process. Speaking on BBC News, polling expert Sir John Curtice, claimed the European Union has “blinked” by offering Britain the delay. He said: “I think the crucial lesson to take away from what has happened in the last ten days is that first of all what became very clear indeed is that the House of Commons was not willing to contemplate the prospect of no deal.
“I think in truth that has been fairly obvious for some time. “But, I think also what emerged is the European Union also blinked and very clearly decided that leaving without a deal, unless we do prove to be awkward customers, is not in their interest. “Not least because, for the time being at least it is not clear that they would be able to maintain the integrity of the single market and have an open border in Northern Ireland if we were to leave without a deal.” He added: “That does, therefore, mean that crucial crutch to which the ERG, the Brexiteers have stuck by for weeks, which is ‘the default is we leave without a deal’. They should now finally realise that default for all practical purposes does not exist.

“It is then the question of whether or not they will be in a position in the coming weeks to use this six month period to try and force the Prime Minister out.” The remaining 27EU nations offered Mrs May a further six months to ratify or alter her withdrawal deal. Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, the Prime Minister told MPs it was their "national duty" to agree to a Brexit deal. She said: “We need to resolve this. So that we can leave the European Union with a deal as soon as possible. “So that we can avoid having to hold those European Parliamentary elections. And above all, so that we can fulfil the democratic decision of the “Referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward. “This is our national duty as elected members of this House - and nothing today is more pressing or more vital.”

The people who vote for us are not stupid. On the contrary, they are very smart, they see that the European Union evolved in a way that is not wishful and they should have another kind of European cooperation. “Just putting that on the table cannot be stupid. This is a smart idea because if we go on with the bulldozers of the European Union, we will crash European cooperation.” With the two biggest political blocs expected to lose their combined majority, Mr Salvini and other far-right leaders hope to form an opposition, eurosceptic alliance with enough seats in the assembly to block or hold up legislation.


MPs failed to break the Brexit stalemate on Monday evening as none of the four amendments put in front of Parliamentarians managed to secure a majority, just days after the Prime Minister’s withdrawal agreement was rejected. Speaking on his LBC show, Nick Ferrari delivered a passionate monologue explaining exactly why he voted for the UK to cut ties with the Brussels bloc. Mr Ferrari described himself as a “moderately reluctant Brexiteer” insisting he did not “wake up in the morning foaming at the mouth on what I perceived Jean-Claude Junker or anybody else to be doing”.
The radio host claimed his vote was influenced by the direction in which he saw the European project going. He said: “With its views as regards a lack of tolerance for people of certain skin colour in Eastern Europe. “With its views also on a lack of tolerance towards homosexuality, towards gay people in parts of Eastern Europe. If that was a club that I was asked to join, I don\'t think so.” Mr Ferrari added: “Just think about it for a second. Do it the other way around: Britain is asked to join a group of 27 other nations, many of which life is very very similar, very very tolerant, very very liberal with a small l. Countries such as France, countries such as Italy, countries such as Germany. I get it, not a problem.
Brexit news: Nick Ferrari explained exactly why he voted to leave the EU
So that\'s where I thought that\'s not British values to me Nick Ferrari
"Now as you start to move east, you go to countries such as Hungary and the countries in the old Soviet Union, where they build walls against you if you got the wrong colour face, which is a fact, the wire mesh fences. Where they round you up if you are homosexual and that\'s a fact. "So that\'s where I thought that\'s not British values to me. I don\'t think I want to join a club where if you\'re gay, you\'re not allowed in. “Or if you\'re not white-faced, you\'re seen as a villain. No, I don\'t think I\'ll join a club like that.” Mr Ferrari also claimed “youth employment” and the economy of certain EU nations influenced his decision.
He said: ”And when you look at the financials as well, I don\'t think really that the youth employment rate in Spain is anything to commend the European Union project. “The fact that Greece is bankrupt, another bank in Italy went bankrupt two weeks ago, France is on the verge also, some French banks and Germany is down to lower growth than us. So there are many many arguments." The passionate tirade comes just a day after MPs failed to support any alternative Brexit plans on Monday in the House of Commons, prompting the Prime Minister to hold a mammoth Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. A call for a customs union with the EU was rejected by just three votes, while demand for a second referendum was defeated by 12 and a Norway-style deal put forward by Nick Boles by 21.


Mark Francois was making the comments while he was on BBC Newsnight
Speaking on BBC Newsnight, Mr Francois waved off claims his European Research Group (ERG) had killed off Brexit by refusing to back Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal. On Monday night, royal assent was given to the bill that would rule out a no deal Brexit and give more time for negotiations to continue with the EU on how the UK will leave. But the ERG has been accused of jeopardising Brexit by repeatedly voting against Mrs May’s deal, a move some believe could halt the UK ever leaving the EU.
Farage and his Brexit party will ‘RISE like a PHOENIX’ in election
When quizzed by the BBC One show’s host Emily Maitlis about whether the bill would mean no deal would be off the cards, he was defiant.
He said: “No. The bill doesn’t actually prevent a no deal.
“It depends on the European Council. The bill gives the Prime Minister a mandate to suggest a date for an extension, but it doesn’t force the EU to agree.
“Both sides have to agree the extension.

Speaking from Downing Street, Mrs May suggested she would make any further Brexit delay “as short as possible”. But her request, which contains little detail, is likely to infuriate EU leaders ahead of an emergency summit in Brussels next week. Responding, Mr Tusk promised to listen to the Prime Minister’s latest plan and urged European colleagues to do the same.
The European Council president said: “Even if, after today, we don’t know what the end result will be, let us be patient.” Mrs May vowed not to hold European Parliament elections in the UK in her address to the nation. Mrs May said: "I have always been clear that we could make a success of no deal in the long term but leaving with a deal is the best solution. "So we will need a further extension of Article 50 – one that is as short as possible and which ends when we pass a deal.
EU set to reject Theresa May Brexit delay unless UK holds EU Parliament elections
"And we need to be clear what such an extension is for – to ensure we leave in a timely and orderly way. "This debate, this division, cannot drag on much longer." This will limit any extension until May 22, which is the day before Britain would have to participate in the euro ballot. An EU diplomat told Express.co.uk: "There must be European Parliament elections in the UK. May will need to produce a good reason to convince leaders of a short extension. It\'s not very likely."


Phil Hogan, the European Commission’s agriculture chief, claimed a no deal Brexit would have consequences on both sides of the Channel. The Irish eurocrat described the prospect of a hard divorce as “simply crazy” as he set out implications for no deal. He warned that there would be “significant disruption” to the agri-food market if Britain quits the EU without a deal, causing significant financial upset across the bloc.
“Despite the madness of Brexit, I still believe common sense will prevail,” he said. “No deal makes no sense, it’s simply crazy. “There’s no such thing as a good outcome in relation to Brexit, but I believe that a no-deal Brexit is the worst of all outcomes.” The largest hit will likely come to EU farmers, who currently sell more to Britain than any other country in the world. Mr Hogan said: “The EU27 and United Kingdom are very significant trading partners. The EU27 enjoys a €25 billion surplus with the UK for agri-food products, with exports of €41bn on an annual basis.
EU official Phil Hogan warns of £20 billion hit to European farmers in no-deal Brexit
“This surplus is higher than the overall EU trade surplus of €21bn with the rest of the world.” Britain could leave the EU without a deal as soon as Friday unless Theresa May can agree another Brexit delay with EU leaders this week. The European Commission has vowed to offer farmers on the Continent financial support in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Brussels-based executive has tried to shift the emphasis of hard Brexit damage onto Britain, suggesting the country’s farmers would be hit the hardest.
“One should not underestimate the importance of the EU market for the UK. given that the EU will treat the UK as any other third country, with application of tariffs and SPS checks, this presents a significant challenge for UK producers and exporters,” Mr Hogan added. Commission officials have suggested that a no-deal Brexit would likely trigger a food shortage in Britain. Sources claim that there is no “alternative ready source” for Britain to import agri-food products outside of the EU. They said: “The UK is hugely reliant on imports from the EU and for particular products, for example fruit and vegetables.


Conservative Party MP Steve Baker has warned that he may vote with the Labour Party in a confidence motion in the Government if the Prime Minister was to accept Britain staying in the customs union. MPs are set to vote on potential future steps of the Brexit process on Monday after the Prime Minister’s withdrawal agreement was voted down last week. One of the indicative votes includes the possibility of the UK staying in the customs union, with the original proposal only losing by six votes last Wednesday.
Speaking on Politics Live, BBC presenter Jo Coburn said: “If Theresa May does that if she bolts on a customs union, would you vote against her Government in a no-confidence motion?” Deputy Chair of the Conservative Party\'s eurosceptic European Research Group, Mr Baker, said he was “hoping not to reach that point” and would “expect to always vote with the Government in a confidence motion.” The BBC host continued: “You said that the party would be shattered. If in the end, she does what you absolutely verdantly oppose, would you, at that 11th hour, if Labour brings forward a no-confidence motion, vote for it?” Mr Baker replied: “Look, at this point, I can foresee no circumstances while as a Conservative MP I voted against the Government in a confidence motion.
Brexit news: Steve Baker warned he could vote against the Government in a no-confidence vote
I think these things are coming onto the table Steve Baker
“But, we are approaching the point where the stakes are now so very high and so transcend party politics and what this country is about, and the fundamental British value, that political power rests on consent, that I think these things are coming onto the table.” When pressed, Mr Baker added: “It’s on the table.” It comes after the Brexiteer wrote a threat on Twitter showing how much his side had already compromised since the historic 2016 EU referendum. He wrote: "1. We are still in the EU nearly 3 years after the Referendum. We accepted the Art 50 route. We then accepted another 18 months of the implementation period.
"2. We accepted ECJ jurisdiction over the agreement including over how much we pay and EU citizens rights. "3. We accepted £39bn as a price to get to trade talks. "4. We found we had to accept the Number 10 negotiating team negotiating in secrecy. "5. UK fish were to be treated as outside of the single customs territory for trade purposes as a prelude to fishing rights for trade deal. "6. This was always a bad deal. We compromised and compromised but we were not prepared to accept the threat to our constitution and democracy resulting from the Northern Irish backstop and the acceptance of EU laws over which we would have no say."


Jacob Rees-Mogg has claimed the UK should “be very difficult” and frustrate the EU should there be a lengthy Brexit delay. The Conservative MP for North East Somerset said the UK would have the opportunity to “veto” the European Union’s budget and halt French President Emmanuel Macron’s plans for “further deep integration”. Speaking to Sophy Ridge, the Chairman of the Tory party’s eurosceptic European Research Group claimed the UK should become the “most difficult member possible” if Brexit is delayed even further.
Jacob Rees-Mogg said: “The greatest reason being the potential to split up the United Kingdom at the behest of the EU, which is why I said last week that if we are forced to Remain in, we should be the most difficult member possible. “I don’t think the EU and its jargon has behaved towards us with sincere cooperation. I don’t think sincere cooperation could possibly include trying to break up the unity of a member state when it leaves the European Union. “Therefore I think we are no longer obliged to follow sincere cooperation in return. When the Multiannual Financial Framework comes forward, if we are still in, this is our one in seven-year opportunity to veto the budget and to really be very difficult. “And I hope that any British Prime Minister would take that opportunity.”

We should be the most difficult member possible Jacob Rees-Mogg
When asked what he meant by being as “disruptive as possible”, Mr Rees-Mogg replied: “Many things now are taken over by qualified majority vote, and there is nothing we can do about it. “In terms of the budget, each annual budget is set by majority voting, but the seven-year budgetary framework requires unanimity and therefore we could veto that. “We would also be able to stop Mr Macron’s plans for further deep integration because they would almost certainly require treaty change, so as they start to progress, if we were still a member, we would be able to stop them. “It’s trying to stop further integration, and trying to make ensure that it does not cost us any more money. “These would be things that were not just difficult for their own sake but were also in the British national interest if we were still a member state.”
Brexit news: Theresa May has asked the EU for a further Brexit delay until the end of June
On Friday, Mr Rees-Mogg tweeted: “If a long extension leaves us stuck in the EU we should be as difficult as possible. “We could veto any increase in the budget, obstruct the putative EU army and block Mr Macron’s integrationist schemes.” Responding to the remark on Twitter, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt, wrote: “For those in the EU who may be tempted to further extend the Brexit saga, I can only say, be careful what you wish for.” Prime Minister Theresa May wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to the Article 50 process until June 30. The Prime Minister said she will seek to ratify her withdrawal agreement before the European Parliament elections on May 23, but will make "responsible preparations" to take part if that does not prove possible.


Economy minister Peter Altmaier, who has been crucial in Germany’s Brexit policymaking, insisted another Article 50 extension should be used to prevent a “big crash”. He said companies with close trading links to Britain could be forced to lay-off staff if there is a hard Brexit. Theresa May is set to ask EU leaders for another Brexit delay at an emergency summit in Brussels next Wednesday.
Reacting, Mr Altmaier said: “The EU and Great Britain can and must prevent the big crash on the last few metres, because thousands of jobs are at stake! If necessary, by a sufficient extension of the withdrawal period.”
He added: “Companies with a high export to Great Britain can generally be affected. I hope, however, that this will not lead to layoffs.”
The German economy minister also revealed that he wants Britain to remain in the customs union in order to keep products cheaper in his own country.
Asked about the risk of Brexit to supermarket prices, he said: “The risk may exist with products imported from the UK, for example car parts and whisky.


BBC host Martha Kearney pointed out to the Independent Group politician that MPs had rejected every proposal, apart from avoiding a no deal, in the Commons. None of the Brexit alternative amendments reached a majority in the Commons on Monday evening, prompting the Prime Minister to call a mammoth Cabinet meeting to try to find a way forward. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Ms Kearney quizzed Ms Soubry as the Independent Group voted against Ken Clarke’s proposal for a permanent customs union.
The host said: “You have had two days now of indicative votes and MPs have completely failed to unite around any kind of compromise.” The MP for Broxtowe said she did “not accept” that analysis, saying: “We have made progress in a days worth of debate than two years of this Government.” The BBC presenter Kearney snapped back: “But, all the votes have been lost haven’t they. “No single option has come forward. You have rejected everything.

“The only thing that MPs are agreeing on is that they don’t want no deal.” During the BBC interview, the Independent Group MP outlined why they did not back the customs union amendment which was rejected by a majority of three votes. Ms Soubry said: “It doesn’t deliver the regulatory alignment which is needed for the frictionless trade. “I made that very clear point to Ken last week and I made it again last night.” The Prime Minister and her senior ministers met on Tuesday morning after MPs failed to find a majority for any Brexit alternative. A call for a customs union with the EU was rejected by just three votes, while demand for a second referendum was defeated by 12 and a Norway-style deal put forward by Nick Boles by 21.


The remaining EU27 agreed to give the UK a six-month Brexit extension until the end of October after the Prime Minister asked for a delay to the Article 50 process. Speaking on BBC News, polling expert Sir John Curtice, claimed the European Union has “blinked” by offering Britain the delay. He said: “I think the crucial lesson to take away from what has happened in the last ten days is that first of all what became very clear indeed is that the House of Commons was not willing to contemplate the prospect of no deal.
“I think in truth that has been fairly obvious for some time. “But, I think also what emerged is the European Union also blinked and very clearly decided that leaving without a deal, unless we do prove to be awkward customers, is not in their interest. “Not least because, for the time being at least it is not clear that they would be able to maintain the integrity of the single market and have an open border in Northern Ireland if we were to leave without a deal.” He added: “That does, therefore, mean that crucial crutch to which the ERG, the Brexiteers have stuck by for weeks, which is ‘the default is we leave without a deal’. They should now finally realise that default for all practical purposes does not exist.

“It is then the question of whether or not they will be in a position in the coming weeks to use this six month period to try and force the Prime Minister out.” The remaining 27EU nations offered Mrs May a further six months to ratify or alter her withdrawal deal. Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, the Prime Minister told MPs it was their "national duty" to agree to a Brexit deal. She said: “We need to resolve this. So that we can leave the European Union with a deal as soon as possible. “So that we can avoid having to hold those European Parliamentary elections. And above all, so that we can fulfil the democratic decision of the referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward. “This is our national duty as elected members of this House - and nothing today is more pressing or more vital.”


Lewis Hamilton has hailed Ayrton Senna ahead of Formula One\'s 1000th meeting
The Chinese Grand Prix will bring up 1000 F1 races in motorsport\'s premier competition. Hamilton is hoping to follow up on his Bahrain victory to leapfrog Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas to the top of the Drivers’ Championship. The Brit was asked to reflect on the most memorable race of his lifetime. And watching his late hero in action at Donington, where he overtook four drivers including the legendary Michael Schumacher on the opening lap, stood head and shoulders above the rest.
“I think everyone knows I was inspired by Ayrton Senna, and that’s where a lot of my passion for F1 came from,” Hamilton told the Chinese Grand Prix race programme. “I started watching Formula 1 with my dad when I was just four or five years old. I loved cars. “At the time, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost were the leaders of the pack and they immediately caught my attention. “I would come home from school and quite often put on a video of Ayrton Senna. I wanted to be him. I aspired to drive the way he drove, and to achieve something similar to what he achieved.
Ayrton Senna won the 1993 European Grand Prix
“And Ayrton’s great races would be among my favourites. You think of the amazing performances in Monaco. “But the one that obviously stands out for everyone is his incredible first lap of Donington, in the wet, at the European Grand Prix in 1993. “It was just phenomenal to watch.” Hamilton’s own personal favourites come from his five Championship-winning drives.

All alternative Brexit options were rejected in the Commons by MPs on Monday night as MPs voted to try to find an alternative solution to the Brexit stalemate. BBC’s Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg has claimed the Remainer sects within the Commons have failed in trying to “sit down and make peace” as they found to find a majority on any alternative. Kuenssberg also claimed a Remainer cabinet minister was “hopping mad” with the Scottish National Party as they abstained from voting on the customs union amendment.
The BBC\'s Political Editor said: “The Government minister I bumped into was absolutely hopping mad that the SNP didn’t come over to the customs union. “He said ‘I can’t believe it, this is our way out’. This is someone who is a soft Brexiteer, who is a strong Remainer but wants a Brexit compromise. “Those Remain forces, former Remainer forces, have all been working ahead together behind the scenes and he was furious. “Lots of different factions. Lots of different tribes who haven’t been willing to sit down and make peace.”

She added: “Interestingly even the People’s Vote guys, even the Independent Group, quite of lot of acid commentary tonight that the new Independent Group that wanted a new type of politics are proving to be just as unwilling to comprise as some of those from the more traditional parts.” BBC’s Europe Editor Katya Adler claimed all Remainer groups within the Commons were trying to be the “last one standing” in a bid to get their preferred option over the line. She added: “Isn’t it just that everybody still just thinks if they are the last ones standing they will win out in the end. “So they are just unwilling to compromise because they just think, ‘well everybody else will just compromise and we will just stick to our guns and we will get what we want’. “From here it feels like the EU, they cannot believe it again tonight to be honest.”
The Prime Minister and her senior ministers will meet on Tuesday morning after MPs failed to find a majority for any Brexit alternative. A call for a customs union with the EU was rejected by just three votes, while a demand for a second referendum was defeated by 12 and a Norway-style deal put forward by Nick Boles by 21. Following the defeat of his amendment, Mr Boles immediately declared that he would no longer sit as a Conservative MP, blaming the party for refusing to compromise on a means of leaving the European Union. A statement from Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay read: “This is the second time the House has considered a wide variety of options for a way forward, it has once again failed to find clear majority for any of the options. “And yet the result of the House\'s decision on Friday not to endorse the Withdrawal Agreement means that the default legal position is that the UK will leave the EU in just 11 days\' time. “To secure any further extension, the Government will have to put forward a credible proposition to the EU as to what we will do with that extra time. This House has continuously rejected leaving without a deal, just as it has rejected not leaving at all. Therefore the only option is to find a way through which allows the UK to leave with a deal.


Toulouse are looking to win the Champions Cup
The big hitters all bring something different to the feast and in a season of English under-achievement Saracens’ refusal to lower the flag should be applauded but it is the presence of Toulouse which completes the whole. At a time when the last rites have been read to the French national team, the green shoots bursting out from the country’s most charismatic club side signify that French rugby is not dead after all. That it is Toulouse who provide the pulse is a fact worthy of wider appreciation. This is the club who won the inaugural European Cup in 1996, the first of three triumphs in the tournament’s first decade. Another followed in 2010 with two other trips to the final thrown in during a golden period under Guy Noves too. It was not just the success though it was the shaft of light Toulouse brought to Europe with their intoxicating blend of power and movement.
They were the one French club to see the big picture and place Europe on a pedestal above the annual hunt for the Bouclier de Brennus in the domestic league and what style they brought to the party. Their subsequent decline as Toulon’s more muscular interpretation of what French rugby should look like took over on the European stage left a hole. Toulouse missed out on qualification for the Champions Cup for the first time last season and were left forlornly peddling their wares in the second-tier Challenge Cup. It was like seeing Tom Jones on at the Dog and Duck. But this season, reignited by a troupe of largely home-grown youngsters brought through their own academy, the entertainers are back.
Cheslin Kolbe is up for European player of the year
Toulouse’s performance in an extraordinary quarterfinal against Racing on Sunday with 14 men after the dismissal of Zach Holmes was a thing of wonder. Lucas Tauzin’s no-look offload for Maxime Medard’s try belonged to The Magic Circle not Paris’s La Defense Arena. Scrum-half Antoine Dupont is on the shortlist for European player of the season as is Toulouse’s South African wing Cheslin Kolbe. Under the club’s former wing Ugo Mola, who is assisted by two other Toulouse old boys in William Servat and Jean Bouilhou, Toulouse have rediscovered their essence. They have lost only once since September - to their upcoming semifinal opponents Leinster in the group stage but beat the defending champions in the south of France in round two.
Saracens’ semifinal against Munster on Easter Saturday will be a monumental arm wrestle, a brutalist contest where structure and suffocation will be the order of the day. In its own way it will be an absorbing clash of like v like but Leinster against Toulouse could be a piece of art. Leinster can play a bit of rugby themselves - their 52-3 destruction of Wasps in round one was a sight to behold – and if they decide to let the brake off and see which team can outrun the other, the Aviva Stadium could witness a game for the ages. The venue will play into the Irish province’s hands. Given how often Leinster and their Irish internationals play there it is effectively a home tie. But even if Toulouse’s involvement in this season’s tournament ends in Dublin it has been invigorating to see the coolest cats in European rugby purring once more. Meanwhile, on the international scene, Ireland have lost flanker Dan Leavy for the World Cup after scans revealed he sustained serious knee ligament damage on Saturday.
Toulouse are looking to win this year\'s Champions Cup
Leavy was taken from the field on a stretcher after being hurt in Leinster’s Champions Cup quarterfinal tie against Ulster and Joe Schmidt’s worst fears were realised on Monday. “He has been ruled out for the remainder of the season and into next season to include the Rugby World Cup,” said a Leinster spokesman. Leavy, 24, also missed this season’s Six Nations through injury. His stand-in Josh van der Flier is out for the rest of the season with a groin injury sustained against France. Ryan Crotty is the latest All Black to join the post-World Cup exodus with the centre confirming on Monday he is leaving the Crusaders to join Kubota Spears after the tournament.

Brexit support and Member of the Welsh Assembly Conservative Group, Mark Reckless insisted the UK should not have signed up to the EU’s sequencing of negotiations, which put Britain on the back foot from the start. Former Conservative Party MP, Mr Reckless, who joined Ukip in 2014, said the decision to sign up to the EU’s sequencing of Brexit negotiations was “completely ridiculous”. Mr Reckless also claimed the Prime Minister “had the wool pulled over her eyes” with the controversial backstop mechanism within the withdrawal agreement.
He told Express.co.uk: “We should never have agreed to the sequencing of agreeing on money, and I think citizens rights is non-consensus, but agreeing on money before agreeing to a trade deal. “It’s completely ridiculous trying to agree what the arrangements should be for trade and administering the Northern Irish border in advance of the trade deal. “Because what the arrangements are for that, fall out of what our trade agreement is with the European Union, as long as we come to a reasonable agreement and there is goodwill on both sides, I am sure we would. “Then that should mean we don’t need to see a hard border or any sort of infrastructure on the Northern Ireland border, that is completely unnecessary as the Irish themselves accepted earlier in the process, as they have accepted now in terms of planning for no deal and not having it if we don’t have an agreement.”

The politicians need to deliver for the people and if they don’t I don’t know what will happen next Brexiteer Mark Reckless
Mr Reckless added: “I think that the issue of the Irish backstop has been exploited and used in order to try and frustrate the will of the British people for Brexit. “I think that is unacceptable, and I think the Prime Minister has gone along with that or had the wool pulled over her eyes, in the way that no British Prime Minister should have done.” Commenting on the state of negotiations, Mr Reckless said: “We said that we were going to leave on March 29 and the Prime Minister said that over 100 times in the Commons and we are not doing that. “I don’t think people in Westminster understand how much people outside will feel betrayed by that, and I don’t use that word lightly. “The politicians need to deliver for the people and if they don’t I don’t know what will happen next. It is not the country I thought we were as a democracy.”
This week the Prime Minister has been meeting with the Labour Party leader after Theresa May reached out to Jeremy Corbyn to help try and get Britain’s exit from the EU over the line. The move from the Prime Minister enraged a number of Conservative Party colleagues with some in the Tory party’s European Research Group calling for Mrs May to step down. On Wednesday MPs also voted to seek a delay to Brexit rather than risk the UK crashing out of the bloc on April 12, which was passed by 313 votes to 312. The Bill is currently being debated in the House of Lords and peers are scheduled to return to the Chamber on Monday before voting, where it is expected to be passed for Royal Assent.


The European Union may let Britain “resign to its own fate” and leave the Brussels bloc without a Brexit agreement, Bernard Purcell from The Irish World has claimed. Theresa May sent a letter to EU Council President Donald Tusk on Friday asking for an extension to Article 50 until June 30, as she continues talks with the Labour Party to try to find a solution to Brexit. Speaking on BBC’s Dateline London, Mr Purcell warned of a “certain kind of fatalism” from some member states to allow the UK to leave with no deal.
He said: “Yes, Macron has said that Ireland and France are the two that would face the most disruption. “The Netherlands has been putting arrangements in place for the last two years. “The Dutch are supportive of Britain. They feel affection towards it, they do not like to see what is happening. “Ireland is the same, you have the same with Germany. You have the same with the Scandinavian states.

There is a certain kind of fatalism that people might have to allow Britain to resign to its own fate Bernard Purcell
“But, at the moment, there is a certain kind of fatalism that people might have to allow Britain to resign to its own fate.” On Friday, Mrs May wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to the Article 50 process until June 30. The Prime Minister said she will seek to ratify her withdrawal agreement before the European Parliament elections on May 23, but will make "responsible preparations" to take part if that does not prove possible. Mrs May said if ongoing talks with Labour do not lead to a "single unified approach soon" then the Government would instead look to establish a "consensus" on options on a future relationship that could be put to the Commons.
In her letter, she wrote: "I am writing therefore to inform the European Council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty. "The United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June 2019. If the parties are able to ratify before this date, the Government proposes that the period should be terminated early. "The Government will want to agree a timetable for ratification that allows the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union before 23 May 2019 and therefore cancel the European Parliament elections, but will continue to make responsible preparations to hold the elections should this not prove possible." Reports suggest Mr Tusk is recommending a longer postponement of one year, with a break clause in the case of earlier ratification, in a so-called "flextension" deal.


BBC Weather forecaster Ben Rich warned of unsettled weather across Europe as a brutal weather system heads towards the continent. Mr Rich said: “There’s a lot of rain to come here over the next few days. Also, bands of wet weather sliding out of Spain and Portugal and into southern France. We will once again see some snowfall over the Alps. We have had a lot of snow here over recent days so there is the potential for avalanches.”

Turkey and Italy are set to remain dry while Greece suffers from heavy rain on Saturday. But the BBC forecaster warned a band of rain will then move in across southern France, adding: “A lot of heavy showers across Spain and Portugal where it will also be very windy, particularly gusty conditions close to the coast. “But amidst all of that there is some fine weather to be had. Germany for the most part seeing sunshine. “Temperatures in Berlin up to 21C – not bad at all for this time of year. It stays fine here as we go on into Sunday.
BBC Weather warns of avalanche risk in the Alps over the weekend
“You’ll see some further snowfall across the Alps. Although, generally, this frontal system weakening as it drifts its way northwards. Still, some outbreaks of showery rain into southern Italy and across the south east of Europe. “Some rain, sleet and snow affecting parts of Sweden over the next few days. It should dry up in Stockholm as we get into Tuesday and Wednesday but it will turn an awful lot colder. “Equally, in Moscow it will turn showery but mild over the next five days. “The weather gradually improves in Athens.”


The Tory MEP outlined exactly why he thinks the European Union is responsible for the Brexit impasse during a heated row with an Irish MEP. Speaking on euronews\' Raw Politics, Mr Hannan said: “The reason we are in this position is because the EU is making of the UK a demand that it wouldn’t make of any other country for permanent control of our trade policy and the regulatory annexation of part of our territory. I mean, imagine if it had said to Canada during the trade talks, ‘we will only sign a trade deal if you give us regulatory control of Quebec and we control your trade and, by the way, we might not give you the trade deal after all. I mean, of course, we are not going to sign up for that’.
The EU is making of the UK a demand that it wouldn’t make of any other country Daniel Hannan
The comments sparked a huge row between the Brexiteer and Irish MEP Matt Carthy, who fired back and said: “That’s not what happened. “The proposal put forward by the European Union was a backstop that covered Northern Ireland. It was Theresa May’s proposal that that would encompass the entire United Kingdom as she would see it. “And then turn around the number of weeks later and said ‘no British Prime Minister would ever say it’. “The reason we are in the difficulty that we are in is because the British Government’s bad fate.”

The Sinn Féin MEP insisted there are three underpinning principles of the Good Friday Agreement which have not been respected. He said: “One, is the principle of consent. That is where everybody agreed, the Irish Republicans as well as everybody else, said there would be no constitutional change to the status of the North of Ireland.” Mr Hannan fired back and said: “It is a constitutional change. This Brussels control of the Northern Ireland economy is a constitutional change.” As the pair continued to shout over each other, the Irish MEP blasted: “It is removing the north from the EU. That’s the big constitutional change against the democratically expressed wishes of the majority of those who voted. “The second thing is the rights of people in the north to be British, Irish or both.”


Theresa May convinced the European Union to agree to a new extension postponing Brexit to the end of October. With the prospect of Britain being forced to field candidates for the European parliamentary elections scheduled for May, Brexiteer Mark Francois issued a dire warning to Brussels of an incoming onslaught of eurosceptic British politicians winning seats in the European Parliament. Speaking to France 24, the pro-Brexit Tory said: "If there are going to be European elections because we have not left the European Union, then our MEPs will have exactly the same power in Parliament as the MEPs from any other country.
"The public in this country want to leave. If you try and hold us in against out will, we will make life difficult for you. "If there are European elections on May 23, given the growing frustration in Britain, we will probably send you the most eurosceptic group of MEPs you have ever seen." The Prime Minister last week requested a delay of the Brexit deadline to June 30 in a last-ditch attempt to draft a satisfactory withdrawal deal with the help of Jeremy Corbyn. But as EU Council boss Donald Tusk and other EU leaders counteroffered - and appeared to agree to - a longer extension, Mr Francois predicted difficult times ahead for supporters of the European project.

Brexit news: Francois warned Brussels of the potential consequences of an extension
He continued: "They will then probably tie up with other MEPs in the European Parliament who do not entirely believe in the European project in the way President Macron does. "You will end up with a European Parliament largely made up of eurosceptics who, potentially, will make it difficult for the Parliament to advance the project in which Macron so passionately believes." While the top parties within the European Parliament - the European People\'s Party and the Socialists and Democrats - are expected to win the largest number of seats at the polls, several experts have predicted a surge of support for eurosceptic parties from across the bloc. Investors expect heightened political uncertainty after the May 26 election, in which 705 members of the European Parliament MEPs will be elected, or 751 if Britain fails to leave the EU as planned. Before the summit, Mr Tusk warned "neither side should be allowed to feel humiliated at any stage in this difficult process".


Prime Minister Theresa May will make a personal plea to France’s Emmanuel Macron in Paris today not to veto her request for a further delay to Brexit. Mrs May will also hold talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin to try and bolster support for her request to delay Brexit until June 30. EU leaders will be under pressure to decide whether to grant Britain another delay, a decision that can be vetoed by any of the other 27 member states.
Emmanuel Macron really has sold himself as Mr Europe and that’s the message that he keeps pushing Catherine Nicholson
But France 24’s Catherine Nicholson said the French President is set to take a hard line against the UK at an EU summit on Wednesday over fears the Brexit deadlock is destabilising the EU. She told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “Emmanuel Macron, he keeps repeating that it’s Europe’s interests that really has to come first here. “He really has sold himself as Mr Europe and that’s the message that he keeps pushing.” President Macron could demand there be no extension of the Article 50 process unless the Prime Minister signs up to binding commitments to stand aside from the EU decision-making process.
Brexit news: Theresa May to make personal plea to Macron over extension
Whereas Max Hoffman, who is Bureau Chief at Deutsche Welle in Brussels, said Angela Merkel is likely to be more patient than any other EU leader. Mr Hoffman added: “Angela Merkel is most likely one of those willing to have the most patience with the UK Government. “She has repeatedly said that there is still time. “And I have no doubt, just like many colleagues here in Brussels, that she will try and up until the last minute to avoid a no deal Brexit.”
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned it is "crucial to know when and on what basis the UK will ratify the Withdrawal Agreement" as the EU considers Mrs May\'s request to delay. Britain will leave the EU at 10pm on Friday if not Brexit extension is granted. As a result of the extension, Theresa May has been forced to find candidates for the European elections for six weeks time - one month after she said it would be “unacceptable” to take part in elections after the UK voted to leave the bloc. While the UK is seeking an extension of Article 50 to June 30, it looks likely the EU27 summit in Brussels will demand the UK extend Brexit to the end of the year.

Speaking from Downing Street, Mrs May suggested she would make any further Brexit delay “as short as possible”. But her request, which contains little detail, is likely to infuriate EU leaders ahead of an emergency summit in Brussels next week. Responding, Mr Tusk promised to listen to the Prime Minister’s latest plan and urged European colleagues to do the same.
The European Council president said: “Even if, after today, we don’t know what the end result will be, let us be patient.” Mrs May vowed not to hold European Parliament elections in the UK in her address to the nation. Mrs May said: "I have always been clear that we could make a success of no deal in the long term but leaving with a deal is the best solution. "So we will need a further extension of Article 50 – one that is as short as possible and which ends when we pass a deal.
EU set to reject Theresa May Brexit delay unless UK holds EU Parliament elections
"And we need to be clear what such an extension is for – to ensure we leave in a timely and orderly way. "This debate, this division, cannot drag on much longer." This will limit any extension until May 22, which is the day before Britain would have to participate in the euro ballot. An EU diplomat told Express.co.uk: "There must be European Parliament elections in the UK. May will need to produce a good reason to convince leaders of a short extension. It\'s not very likely."


BBC’s Europe Editor Katya Adler has claimed some EU leaders could be ready to grant the UK another short extension to try to get Brexit over the line. Reports suggest European Council President Donald Tusk favours a longer extension, of around a year, with the option to cut the delay short if a Brexit deal is agreed. Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show, BBC’s Europe Editor Adler claimed if there is a longer extension “EU leaders worry this could just go on forever”.
She said: “At the emergency Brexit summit on Wednesday in Brussels, all the 27EU leaders will first listen to Theresa May. “She will then be asked to leave the room while they discuss what to do about her extension request. “Very importantly they have to come to a unanimous decision under EU law and fireworks are predicted, whether it’s a massive display or just a regular one, we don’t quite know at the moment. “Basically the Prime Minister has asked for another extension ending at the end of June, there are EU leaders at the moment who say ‘well you know what, the advantage to that is it would keep MPs under pressure’.
BBC\'s Katya Adler claimed some EU leaders may favour a short Brexit delay
“Because if it is a short extension, they have to come to a decision, and based on past performance, EU leaders worry this could just go on forever. You have a longer extension and everybody will just go round and round.” She added: “They are really fed up with this process, they are not really fed up with the United Kingdom, and I think that’s really important to distinguish. “Some leaders are now saying, ‘might the UK change its mind’, but whatever happens if we leave it is in the EU’s interest, socially, economically and politically to keep us as close as possible and keep relations as close as possible. “Those who see a longer extension would be a good idea, so you have got Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council, he is calling for this so-called ‘flextension’, so it is a longer extension, but we can get out once a Brexit deal has been ratified. “Then it comes to Emmanuel Macron who has been saying loud and clear, ‘do not take any extension for granted because you Theresa May have to come to us with a very clear plan’. Again, a slight health warning on this. He said it last time and I think just when the Prime Minister speaks or Jeremy Corbyn, they are speaking to their own audiences.”

On Sunday the Prime Minister delivered a video message from her Chequers country retreat on delivering the result of the 2016 referendum. Mrs May said: "There are lots of things on which I disagree with the Labour Party on policy issues. "But on Brexit I think there are some things we agree on: ending free movement, ensuring we leave with a good deal, protecting jobs, protecting security. "And so we are talking. Can we find a way through this that ensures that we can get a good deal and a deal agreed through Parliament? "It\'ll mean compromise on both sides but I believe that delivering Brexit is the most important thing for us." The Prime Minister wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to the Article 50 process until June 30. She said she will seek to ratify her withdrawal agreement before the European Parliament elections on May 23, but will make "responsible preparations" to take part if that does not prove possible. Reports suggest Mr Tusk is recommending a longer postponement of one year, with a break clause in the case of earlier ratification, in a so-called "flextension" deal.


A tiny number of accounts backing anti-EU parties such as Spanish right-wingers Vox and Alternative for Germany make up the majority of Twitter, Facebook and YouTube posts. While less than 0.1 percent of social media users across Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Poland actually support a populist party, around 10 percent of online content relating to the euro ballot backed eurosceptics. Research firm Alto Data Analytics analysed the top 200 keywords and found the five most popular focused on key eurosceptic and populist campaign efforts.
Immigration, European asylum policy, Islam and European election made up over half the output of the social media content analysed. In Germany, Alto’s data shows from December 15, 2018, to March 15, 2019, that 31.6 percent of mentions refer to the AfD and its associated politicians. Angela Merkel’s CDU fell drastically behind with only 22.9 percent of the political social media posts focused on the government. Facebook and YouTube are the most popular platforms with AfD-related posts and Kremlin-backed Russia Today and Sputnik are most likely destinations.
Eurosceptic presence on social media trumps pro-EU accounts
Ben Nimmo, a senior research fellow at the Atlantic Council, told Politico: “To get a relatively small group generating such a large percentage of content is emblematic of fringe parties. “The goal is to break out of their echo chambers and research other people.” Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg last week shared a video of Alice Weidel, the AfD\'s parliamentary leader, on a YouTube page focused on anti-EU and right-wing views. Ahead of the EU elections, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg refused to guarantee his platform cutting out all interference in the ballot. He said: “We’ve certainly made a lot of progress. But no, I don’t think anyone can guarantee in a world where you have nation states that are trying to interfere in elections, there’s no single thing we can do and say okay we’ve now solved the issue.


Prime Minister Theresa May travelled to the EU summit in Brussels on Wednesday after sending a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk last week requesting an extension to the Article 50 process until June 30. Mr Tusk originally called for a "flexible extension" to Brexit lasting "as long as necessary and no longer than one year". Arriving in Brussels at the EU summit, Latvia’s Prime Minister, Arturs Krisjanis Karins, claimed the UK has three Brexit options remaining.
He said: “Look, the decision of what to do is up to the British Government, the British Parliament and the British people. They have really three choices. “You can always go for a no deal, you can go for a deal, that’s been negotiated. “And, there’s the third option, in the end, to revoke Article 50. It’s up to the British to decide.” He added: “The future of Britain is in Britain’s hands.

“The British Government is asking us for an extension. We will be discussing that this evening. “I think it makes sense. If the Brits are saying they need a little bit more time to decide what they want, I don’t think we should be saying no to that. “I think we should be open because, in the end, we have negotiated in good faith, a withdrawal agreement, if that’s what’s wanted, but until now there has been no agreement if that’s what is wanted from the Parliament side. Let’s see.” Arriving at the EU summit on Wednesday, the Prime Minister was asked if she was “embarrassed” about asking for an extension. Mrs May replied: “I know many people will be frustrated that the summit is taking place at all because the UK should have left the EU by now. “I greatly regret the fact that Parliament has not been able to pass a deal that would enable us to leave in a smooth and orderly way.” She added: “But, I and the Government continue to work to find a way forward. We have been talking with the opposition and there has been serious constructive talks. They will continue tomorrow.
“The purpose of this summit is to agree to an extension which gives us more time to agree to a deal to enable us to leave the EU in that smooth and orderly way. “What matters I think is that I have asked for an extension to June 30, but what is important is that any extension enables us to leave at the point of which we ratify the withdrawal agreement. So we could leave on the 22 May and start to build our brighter future.” Speaking in Brussels, EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that any extension to the Article 50 process “must serve a purpose”. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte opened up on the division among the EU27 over the length of any extension.


German chancellor Angela Merkel lobbied hard for mass migration after it became clear in 2015 German industry could grind to a halt without a million-strong injection of cheap labour. But, as the young and ambitious next generation of wealth-creators headed from smaller, poorer states in the east to bigger wealthier nations like the Germany, France and the UK the countries they left behind were left facing economic hardship and financial ruin. Today Romania’s finance minister Eugen Teodorovici again blamed European Union’s unchecked migration policy for a crippling “brain drain” which was crushing his country’s ability to compete and called on the EU to end the brain drain. Express.co.uk highlighted this cruel spin-off of western nations taking eastern Europe’s brightest and best in a series of exclusive articles, written by reporter Zoie O’Brien. We are reprinting a key article below as it remains as relevant – perhaps more relevant – today as it was three years ago. It focuses on Albania – slated to become a member of the EU in 2020 – but the plight of that nation’s towns is mirrored across swathes of eastern Europe. GHOST TOWNS of Albania – the terrible cost of Merkel’s unchecked Euro migration ANGELA Merkel’s EU policy encouraging unchecked mass movement of young people from poor European areas to rich ones is creating GHOST TOWNS across the continent. THE TRUE cost of the EU’s controversial push for unchecked migration was laid bare again today as it became clear rich western nations like Germany were gobbling up the wealth- creating resources of smaller, poorer counties leaving them facing economic ruin. The massive unchecked migration, encouraged by EU policies, is turning already financially weak nations into economic basket cases and leaving a glut of dying towns and villages populated only by old people. In Albania – which is tabled to become an EU member by 2020 - almost ALL young people dream of new lives in Britain or Germany. Many of them are already working here illegally. Germany in particular needs massive inward migration to keep its powerhouse economy moving and, as Express.co.uk reporter Zoie O’Brien discovered as she travelled in Albania, young Albanians are only to happy to provide that labour. But the knock-on effect is that their home nations are left with little or no young labour force to create the wealth for the next generation.
The reality of this situation was made evident to our reporter triggering fears nations like Albania would never recover and have to be propped up by EU cash. Talks between the EU and Albania about the Balkan state joining are at an advanced stage after a meeting last night.

Already thousands of Albanian nationals have flocked to the UK in search of better wages and living conditions, and the impact on their struggling economy is being felt across the nation. But, decision makers in Europe are taking their bid to join the union seriously, with some saying they could be a member state as soon as 2020. And thousands are counting on membership, so they can leave their homeland legally. Poverty in the country is described by its people as \'catastrophic\' with huge numbers of unemployed young people. In the last six years, 30 per cent of the 3 million population has left the country and are living abroad.
But the stats paint a false picture according to the younger members of society who admit they work illegally in Europe. And the authorities claim they have no idea how many have left illegally. Visa Llah, 17, dreams of working in the UK as his older brother does now. He said: "The young people here it is difficult for them to find a job. Some of them they just leave Albania and go to wherever they can find a little work. "My friends, they don\'t earn anything. This is our chance to join Europe. We are really trying to get going in the union and really I want to join, I will enjoy it so much. "It will bring more money and more jobs here in Albania. My brother is in London. He really had good work, he is winning money and he really loves the UK.

"My cousins, two of them, they went illegally to the UK and now they are trying to arrange their proper papers. "I try to pay attention in my studies and to learn English because it is the most important language in the world. I have lived in Italy for seven years and sometimes I return to Albania. "Yes, I want to go to England. I love the UK. Maybe because my brother is there but I want to go." A Government employee who did not wished to be named revealed the UK is the destination of choice for the young people, claiming thousands will head for Britain rather than easier to reach countries.

He said: "The UK is heaven for Albanians. It is their favourite destination, who cares about Italy and Germany? "They work like dogs and at the end of the month they say it was worth it. Thousands will come. The first wave will be people with family in the UK and the second will be when people raise funds for the trip." The average earnings in Albania are €350 per month. But jobs are rare and rent can be expensive. One man told Express.co.uk he has no choice but to work in Italy for three months at a time.
Many young Albanians already work in the EU illegally
Besi, 28, said: "Young people in Albania are just drinking coffee every day. It is very difficult to find a job here. "If you don\'t have friends with benefits, like business, it is very hard. So we go to Itlay and Germany to earn money and we come home. "The people in the north of Albania and emigrating to the UK. Thousands, because they are very poor. They go to London." Albanians can visit EU countries without a visa for three months at a time legally, since they were given Schengen membership. But this does not entitle them to work.

Arta, 33, who once lived with Albania\'s many street families in ramshackle huts outside of the city centre, moved to Italy with her son for a new life. She said: "Everything is catastrophic. "There is no work. I live in Italy now, when I compare it, the situation here is devastating. Life is so difficult. "Life in Europe to here is incomparable. The people here they really look forward to leaving for another country. They are hoping one day they will leave."


Prime Minister Theresa May secured a six-month Brexit delay this week after she wrote to the European Council President asking for an extension to Article 50 last week. But, the decision angered some Conservative Brexit supporters, with Sir Bill Cash standing up in the Commons on Thursday asking when the Prime Minister will resign. Speaking on BBC News, professor Matthew Goodwin, claimed the Prime Minister will “almost certainly” face a “renewed” attempt by MPs to oust her during the six-month period.
He said: “On one level you could argue that this extension gives Mrs May a bit more room for manoeuvre. “That the pressure, at least in the short term, is off and she can get on with those talks with the Labour Party, which we just heard are ongoing today.” He added: “But, of course, seen from the perspective of the Conservative Party, Mrs May coming back with yet another extension, is a more diminished figure. “Somebody who is almost certainly now going to face a renewed attempt to have her stand down and make way for somebody else.”

Mrs May promised her own MPs last month that she will not lead the next stage of the Brexit process and would stand down as leader once her deal passes through the Commons. On Thursday prominent Tory Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash accused the Prime Minister of "abject surrender" to the EU and asked if she would resign. Mrs May replied: "I think you know the answer to that." Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, the Prime Minister told MPs it was their "national duty" to agree to a Brexit deal.
She said: “We need to resolve this. So that we can leave the European Union with a deal as soon as possible. “So that we can avoid having to hold those European Parliamentary elections. And above all, so that we can fulfil the democratic decision of the referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward. “This is our national duty as elected members of this House - and nothing today is more pressing or more vital.” Responding to the Prime Minister, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: "Yesterday EU leaders agreed to grant the United Kingdom an Article 50 extension until the 31st of October.


A border expert has claimed lorry checks at Brexit Britain’s borders will be “super smooth” despite concerns there could be huge gridlocks on the UK’s roads. Robert Hardy, Operations Director of the Brexit planning agency Oakland Invicta, told Sky News “a lot of no deal planning has been going on for over two years”. He said: “A lot of good work has been done in the background a lot of it under non-disclosure agreements because they had to be that way.
“But a lot of no deal planning has been going on for over two years. “If you look at Dover and Eurotunnel which has been the main pinch point, simply because of the amount of volume of traffic that goes through those routes. Anything that works there will work anywhere else really. “With those, if you break it down into the imports and the exports. The importance, first of all, providing the customer or trader has signed up for simplifications, he will flow through pretty smoothly. “The export declaration is done in Europe, that clears down in Calais. The vehicle then transits to Dover, or Eurotunnel and passes straight through.”

A lot of no deal planning has been going on for over two years Robert Hardy
Sky host Boulton asked that it would be “pretty smoothly”, but “not as smoothly as long as we are both members.” Mr Hardy replied: “Actually no. I am only saying pretty smoothly because our advice has always been we can get you through the border very quickly, but I can’t get you to the border in case there are unprepared people in the way. “When I say pretty smoothly, I am catering for the unprepared in the way. “If everyone was as prepared as the people we are working with, and it is not just us, other agencies are doing a similar thing. “If everyone was on the transitional simplified procedure, it would be super smooth”. Under the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) plans, “transitional simplified procedures” are set to be introduced for ferry routes from Europe, and for the Channel Tunnel, if the UK leaves without a deal on April 12. The “transitional simplified procedures” would be reviewed from three to six months after they are introduced. HM Revenue & Customs\' website reads: “In the event that the UK leaves the EU without a deal, on 12 April 2019, many UK businesses will need to apply the same procedures to EU trade that apply when trading with the rest of the world.


The Independent Group MP got into a fiery debate as he called for Britain to have a so-called ‘People’s Vote’ on the final Brexit deal. The heated exchange began when the Sky News host said: “Interestingly, you spoke about an extreme Brexit. Well, a while ago I was talking to Sir Bernard Jenkin and he said to me that 90 percent of people who voted Leave in the 2016 referendum would prefer the UK to leave on no deal.
“So, he is set in his position and that’s not going to move. You are stuck in your position where you are calling for a People’s Vote. So, we remain at this impasse – we are not moving forwards on this.”
In response, Mr Umunna said Bernard Jenkin was one of the “architects of this mess”, adding: “He was a leading figure who created the Vote Leave campaign.”
But the Sky News host quickly fired back and said: “He could accuse you of being an architect for this mess because of the fact that you were calling for a People’s Vote and we have already had a referendum.”
Mr Umunna replied and claimed Britain does not have a People’s Vote so it is not “causing the chaos we find ourselves in now”.


Ms Abbott was pressed by BBC host Justin Webb on whether the Labour Party would ever reach an agreement with the Government on Brexit - without the UK being forced to have another say on leaving the Brussels bloc. The Labour Party is engaged in talks with the Government after Prime Minister Theresa May reached out to Jeremy Corbyn earlier this week to try to deliver Brexit, much to the anger of MPs within the Tory party’s eurosceptic European Research Group. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the shadow home secretary was quizzed over whether a second Brexit vote was a “necessity” of the negotiations with the Government.
Ms Abbott said: “The Labour Party is united on the fact a People’s Vote is still on the table, that is the conference position.” Pressed by Webb on whether any agreement with the Government must have a second vote attached to it, Ms Abbott said: "We are not saying anything definitively but we have a position." BBC host Webb snapped back: “Hold on a second, if you had a position you would be saying it definitively wouldn’t you? “Lots of your support, I imagine quite a lot of people listening now, would be saying, ‘we need another vote and we need Labour, which is overwhelmingly supported actually by people who would like another opportunity to say they want to remain in the EU, we need to have an opportunity to say that’.” Ms Abbott replied: “People’s Vote was part of the policy package we passed at conference. Of course, you can have different types of People’s Vote, you can have what is called a confirmatory ballot, where you get a deal and you put it back to the people. That’s a standard trade union process, you negotiate a deal, then you bring it back to your members for a vote. “Or you could have a People’s Vote if you thought it was the only way to stop a no deal Brexit, but the principle of the Labour Party supports some kind of People’s Vote was set out in the policy agreed at conference.”

Hang on a minute Diane, that’s crazy isn’t it? BBC host Justin Webb
The BBC host then demanded to know if the British people having another vote after negotiations was a “red line” for Labour. Webb said: “We are sort of getting down to practise now where you have got to ask for things at talks and have them as red lines or not. I think I understand from what you are saying that it is something you put on the table but it’s not necessarily a red line. “In other words, you could do a deal with the Government if they agreed to a deal with the customs union where another vote was not something you stuck with”. Ms Abbott said Labour was a “member led party and the members are being clear on this question of some kind of People’s Vote, so it has to be part of our negotiations with the Government.” The BBC host pressed Ms Abbott over whether it “had to be part of the outcome”, to which the Labour frontbencher repeated: “It has to be part of our negotiations.” Webb said: “Hang on a minute Diane, that’s crazy, isn’t it? I understand you go in with various things, but what I am trying to get from you, because it is so important to so many of your supporters, is another referendum an absolute necessity of doing a deal with the Government or is it something that you might say ‘no it’s okay it’s a good enough deal, we will just go with it’.”
Ms Abbott replied: “I have said to you we have not gone into these talks being dogmatic we have gone into these talks with a pre-existing position, and there are different types of People’s Vote that you can have. “There is no question of the Labour Party leadership dismissing the views of the party as expressed at party conference.” The BBC host continued to press the shadow home secretary as Ms Abbott accused Webb of “putting words in her mouth”. Webb said: “I am just trying to get you to say, will you acknowledge that it is possible these negotiations happen and end and end successfully that there is not another referendum attached to them”. Ms Abbott said it was “not for me to say, you would do better to interview the person leading on the negotiations”. On Friday, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer warned about the progress made in the discussions between them and the Government. He said the Government was "not countenancing any changes" to the wording of the Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future UK-EU relationship. He said: "Well, we\'ve had two rounds of talks and today we\'ve had an exchange of correspondence with the Government. So far, the Government isn\'t proposing any changes to the deal. In particular, it\'s not countenancing any changes to the actual wording of the political declaration. "Now obviously that\'s disappointing; compromise requires change. We want the talks to continue and we\'ve written in those terms to the Government, but we do need change if we\'re going to compromise." But, on Saturday, Chancellor Philip Hammond claimed the Government did not have any “red lines” on their Brexit discussions with the Labour Party.

Of course, you can have different types of People’s Vote, you can have what is called a confirmatory ballot, where you get a deal and you put it back to the people. That’s a standard trade union process, you negotiate a deal, then you bring it back to your members for a vote. “Or you could have a People’s Vote if you thought it was the only way to stop a no deal Brexit, but the principle of the Labour Party supports some kind of People’s Vote was set out in the policy agreed at conference.”

Hang on a minute Diane, that’s crazy isn’t it? BBC host Justin Webb
The BBC host then demanded to know if the British people having another vote after negotiations was a “red line” for Labour. Webb said: “We are sort of getting down to practise now where you have got to ask for things at talks and have them as red lines or not. I think I understand from what you are saying that it is something you put on the table but it’s not necessarily a red line. “In other words, you could do a deal with the Government if they agreed to a deal with the customs union where another vote was not something you stuck with”. Ms Abbott said Labour was a “member led party and the members are being clear on this question of some kind of People’s Vote, so it has to be part of our negotiations with the Government.” The BBC host pressed Ms Abbott over whether it “had to be part of the outcome”, to which the Labour frontbencher repeated: “It has to be part of our negotiations.” Webb said: “Hang on a minute Diane, that’s crazy, isn’t it? I understand you go in with various things, but what I am trying to get from you, because it is so important to so many of your supporters, is another referendum an absolute necessity of doing a deal with the Government or is it something that you might say ‘no it’s okay it’s a good enough deal, we will just go with it’.”
Ms Abbott replied: “I have said to you we have not gone into these talks being dogmatic we have gone into these talks with a pre-existing position, and there are different types of People’s Vote that you can have. “There is no question of the Labour Party leadership dismissing the views of the party as expressed at party conference.” The BBC host continued to press the shadow home secretary as Ms Abbott accused Webb of “putting words in her mouth”. Webb said: “I am just trying to get you to say, will you acknowledge that it is possible these negotiations happen and end and end successfully that there is not another referendum attached to them”. Ms Abbott said it was “not for me to say, you would do better to interview the person leading on the negotiations”. On Friday, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer warned about the progress made in the discussions between them and the Government. He said the Government was "not countenancing any changes" to the wording of the Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future UK-EU relationship. He said: "Well, we\'ve had two rounds of talks and today we\'ve had an exchange of correspondence with the Government. So far, the Government isn\'t proposing any changes to the deal. In particular, it\'s not countenancing any changes to the actual wording of the political declaration. "Now obviously that\'s disappointing; compromise requires change. We want the talks to continue and we\'ve written in those terms to the Government, but we do need change if we\'re going to compromise." But, on Saturday, Chancellor Philip Hammond claimed the Government did not have any “red lines” on their Brexit discussions with the Labour Party.


Brexit will give a push to populism and movements advocating the "disintegration" of the European Union, according to the British historian. Brussels has been warned support for anti-EU parties from across the bloc will see a significant rise at the European parliamentary elections scheduled for May 23-May 26, especially after Britain received a further extension to the Brexit process and is now likely to fight the vote. Speaking to DW, Timothy Garton Ash said: "In my view, the negative consequences for Europe could be even more serious than those for Britain.
"We already see a lot of forces of populism, nationalism and disintegration in different ways in the European Union. "Brexit could give a big, big push to those forces." While the top parties within the European Parliament - the European People\'s Party and the Socialists and Democrats - are expected to win the largest number of seats at the polls, several experts have predicted a surge of support for eurosceptic parties from across the bloc. Investors expect heightened political uncertainty after the May 26 election, in which 705 members of the European Parliament MEPs will be elected, or 751 if Britain fails to leave the EU by May 22 as Theresa May repeatedly pledged.

Brexit news: Brussels has been warned of a populist boom at the polls in May
Prof Garton Ash also suggested the delay in the Brexit process could provide proponents of a second referendum with the time needed to hold a new vote a push Britain to stay in the EU. He continued: "That gives the chance for a democratic process which will end up either with a second referendum and Britain may be staying in the EU, which would be a fantastic chance for Europe, or a softer Brexit. "Both those outcomes are less bad for Europe." But Brexiteer Nigel Farage, who last week announced his plan to stand for European election should the UK participate during the extension, warned europhiles like French President Emmanuel Macron to prepare as their "worst fears will come true." Mr Farage said: "If you’re asking for the new crop of MEPs that come here not to vote against your budget or your army or your long term plans - I promise you, if I come back here I’ll vote against every single piece of it.
Brexit news: May could be ousted if she agrees to a soft exit with Labour


Brexit support and Member of the Welsh Assembly Conservative Group, Mark Reckless insisted the UK should not have signed up to the EU’s sequencing of negotiations, which put Britain on the back foot from the start. Former Conservative Party MP, Mr Reckless, who joined Ukip in 2014, said the decision to sign up to the EU’s sequencing of Brexit negotiations was “completely ridiculous”. Mr Reckless also claimed the Prime Minister “had the wool pulled over her eyes” with the controversial backstop mechanism within the withdrawal agreement.
He told Express.co.uk: “We should never have agreed to the sequencing of agreeing on money, and I think citizens rights is non-consensus, but agreeing on money before agreeing to a trade deal. “It’s completely ridiculous trying to agree what the arrangements should be for trade and administering the Northern Irish border in advance of the trade deal. “Because what the arrangements are for that, fall out of what our trade agreement is with the European Union, as long as we come to a reasonable agreement and there is goodwill on both sides, I am sure we would. “Then that should mean we don’t need to see a hard border or any sort of infrastructure on the Northern Ireland border, that is completely unnecessary as the Irish themselves accepted earlier in the process, as they have accepted now in terms of planning for no deal and not having it if we don’t have an agreement.”
Brexit news: Mark Reckless pointed out May\'s crucial mistake in negotiations
The politicians need to deliver for the people and if they don’t I don’t know what will happen next Brexiteer Mark Reckless
Mr Reckless added: “I think that the issue of the Irish backstop has been exploited and used in order to try and frustrate the will of the British people for Brexit. “I think that is unacceptable, and I think the Prime Minister has gone along with that or had the wool pulled over her eyes, in the way that no British Prime Minister should have done.” Commenting on the state of negotiations, Mr Reckless said: “We said that we were going to leave on March 29 and the Prime Minister said that over 100 times in the Commons and we are not doing that. “I don’t think people in Westminster understand how much people outside will feel betrayed by that, and I don’t use that word lightly. “The politicians need to deliver for the people and if they don’t I don’t know what will happen next. It is not the country I thought we were as a democracy.”
This week the Prime Minister has been meeting with the Labour Party leader after Theresa May reached out to Jeremy Corbyn to help try and get Britain’s exit from the EU over the line. The move from the Prime Minister enraged a number of Conservative Party colleagues with some in the Tory party’s European Research Group calling for Mrs May to step down. On Wednesday MPs also voted to seek a delay to Brexit rather than risk the UK crashing out of the bloc on April 12, which was passed by 313 votes to 312. The Bill is currently being debated in the House of Lords and peers are scheduled to return to the Chamber on Monday before voting, where it is expected to be passed for Royal Assent.


Nigel Farage claimed he was “absolutely” sure Brexit would be delivered after a Sky News host asked him if “his vision had died”. Mr Farage also said the longer extension allowed the British people go to out and vote in European elections and show their frustration. Speaking on Sky News, host Isabel Webster, said: “Just the very fact we are talking about delays to Brexit, down that in many ways mean that Brexit is over really.
“That it is a pipe dream, that your vision has died now.” Mr Farage replied: “Well, let’s be frank, the Prime Minister and most people in the Houses of Parliament have done their best to try to kill Brexit stone dead. “They have done it by endlessly kicking the can down the road. “But, what they haven’t noticed is the growing anger in this country, and not just among Leave voters, a lot of Remain voters are saying ‘what kind country are we if we don’t keep to our democratic principles’.”
Brexit news: Nigel Farage delivered an epic response after being told his vision had \'died\'
So, do I think Brexit will happen? Absolutely Nigel Farage
He added: “The world is looking on astonished at what has happened to our nation. “So, do I think Brexit will happen? Absolutely, I think Brexit will happen. “I think the genie is out of the bottle, I just fear there are more battles to fight until we get there”. Mr Farage claimed the “one good thing” about extending Article 50 further is “it gives the British people the opportunity on May 23 in a European election to express their view.”
On Friday, Mrs May wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to Article 50 until June 30. The Prime Minister said she will seek to ratify her withdrawal agreement before the European Parliament elections on May 23, but will make "responsible preparations" to take part if that does not prove possible. In her letter, she wrote: "I am writing, therefore, to inform the European Council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty. "The United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June 2019. If the parties are able to ratify before this date, the Government proposes that the period should be terminated early. "The Government will want to agree a timetable for ratification that allows the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union before 23 May 2019 and therefore cancel the European Parliament elections, but will continue to make responsible preparations to hold the elections should this not prove possible." Mrs May said if ongoing talks with Labour do not lead to a "single unified approach soon" then the Government would instead look to establish a "consensus" on options on a future relationship that could be put to the Commons.


Germany news: Exports and imports fell more than expected in February
The largest economy in Europe has been dented in recent months by a slowing world economy, trade disputes and Brexit uncertainty. The latest in a string of poor data to come out of Berlin, the Federal Statistics Office said seasonally adjusted exports were down by 1.3 percent on the month. This marks the biggest drop in 12 months, while imports fell 1.6 percent. The trade surplus edged up to €18.7 billion (£16.1 billion) from a revised 18.6 billion euros the previous month.
Germany PLUNGED into financial gloom - \'\'Long-term upswing is OVER\'
Carsten Brzeski from ING said: “There simply seem to be too many crises in global trade for the German export sector to defy all of them at the same time.”
The German economy has come under the radar in recent months on fears of a long-term expansion coming to an end, leading to the top economic institutes in the country slashing their growth forecast for 2019.
In a damning report released last week, the growth forecast was downgraded to 0.8 percent from a previous estimate of 1.9 percent.
The report warned how a hard Brexit, if Britain should leave the European Union with a deal in place, would further damped the prospects of the German economy.


Theresa May was granted a six-month Brexit extension until the end of October after the Prime Minister originally wrote to the bloc to ask for a delay until June 30. On this week’s Brexit The Final Countdown podcast, presenter Rebecca Hutson was joined by Express.co.uk Head of News Paul Baldwin and Video News Editor Thomas Hunt. Mr Baldwin claimed the Prime Minister would go down “as laughable a figure in history as Neville Chamberlain” as he branded Mrs May’s ‘Brexit means Brexit’ slogan as “utterly meaningless”.
He said: “Neville Chamberlain came back after meeting that nice Mr Hitler with a piece of paper and he landed and said famously, I have in my hand a piece of paper guaranteeing peace in our time. “A few months time the worst war the world has ever seen broke out. Obviously, he got that one wrong. “By the same token, her slogan ‘Brexit means Brexit’, will be as utterly meaningless as ‘peace in our time’. “She will be as laughable a figure in history as Neville Chamberlain because she has misread the entire situation for a really long time.” LISTEN TO BREXIT: THE FINAL COUNTDOWN HERE ON ITUNES

Speaking before Wednesday’s EU summit earlier in the show, Mr Baldwin added: “It makes you wonder what the deal that scrapes through would be, because if she is having to beg the EU for more time. She is having to beg her party to fall in line. She is having to beg Corbyn to also fall in line and stop being mean to her. She has tried begging the DUP to try to uphold the billion-pound bargain. “She has proved she is not great at this, I think. We might admire her stoicism. But, I think even that is wearing a bit thin with even her more ardent supporters. “Another thing, if we get an extension, the chances of her being in power and controlling what happens in that extension are nil.

Brexit news: Theresa May was offered a Brexit extension from the EU until the end of October
“The party wants her to go, the country wants her to go, and I bet she wants to go.” The remaining 27 EU nations offered Mrs May a further six months to ratify or alter her withdrawal deal after the Prime Minister asked the bloc for an extension until June 30. Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, the Prime Minister told MPs it was their "national duty" to agree to a Brexit deal. LISTEN TO BREXIT: THE FINAL COUNTDOWN HERE ON ACAST

She said: “We need to resolve this. So that we can leave the European Union with a deal as soon as possible. “So that we can avoid having to hold those European Parliamentary elections. And above all, so that we can fulfil the democratic decision of the referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward. “This is our national duty as elected members of this House - and nothing today is more pressing or more vital.” Responding to the Prime Minister, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: "Yesterday EU leaders agreed to grant the United Kingdom an Article 50 extension until the 31st of October.


Manfred Weber, the frontrunner to take over the leadership of the European Commission from Jean-Claude Juncker in May, distanced himself and his political group from plans to ask for a long Brexit extension. Prime Minister Theresa May requested a delay of the British withdrawal from the European Union until June 30 but EU Council boss Donald Tusk expressed his support for a one-year extension to the talks. But Mr Weber insisted he and the European People\'s Party (EPP) he chairs in the European Parliament would be opposed to Britain remaining in the bloc for an extended period of time.
Speaking to CNBC before Theresa May met with the EU27 at a crunch summit in Brussels, Mr Weber said: "For me and my political family, the EPP in the European Parliament, a short-term extension is the most appropriate way to go forward. "There’s no lack of discussion in Great Britain – the Brits have been discussing Brexit for three years extensively, every day in the newspapers - that there are no new arguments on the table. "The question is not that you need more time to discuss things. The question is whether you are ready to decide." EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier insisted any request for a delay to Brexit “must serve a purpose,’ insisting the UK should outline what the British Government intends to use the extra time for. LISTEN HERE: Latest Brexit news from the Express.co.uk Final Countdown podcast
Brexit news: Weber insisted a short extension is "the only way forward"
The Frenchman said: "Our common purpose is to get the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. “Let me recall that this withdrawal agreement is the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK, which is our common interest." In an appeal before tonight’s critical summit, Mr Tusk urged EU leaders to treat Britain with respect or risk poisoning future relations. He also called for a "flexible extension" lasting "as long as necessary and no longer than one year". The unanimous agreement of all 27 remaining EU states is needed to avoid a no deal Brexit on at 11pm on April 12.


Speaking on Brexitcast, the BBC Brussels correspondent claimed the "strongest link" between the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration agreed between the Prime Minister and the EU is the Irish backstop protocol. Mr Fleming argued the controversial arrangement that has caused both Brexiteers and Remainers to vote against Mrs May\'s proposal, will act as the"base level" of the future relationship between the UK and the EU post-Brexit.
He said: “The strongest link of all is the backstop because that is the basis on which everything will be based because you can only go up from the backstop for the future permanent relationship. “And that’s the sort of secret on this side that people don’t like to talk about. “The backstop is talked about as an insurance policy but it’s actually a base level of what you can have in the future to avoid a hard border in Ireland unless amazing alternative arrangements that no one can actually imagine right now will come in.” It comes as the Prime Minister invited Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to join "national unity" talks aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock.

That’s the sort of secret on this side that people don’t like to talk about Adam Fleming
The cross-party talks will aim at an agreement on changes to the political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the Brussels bloc. Mrs May is set to ask the EU for a further Brexit delay at an emergency Brussels summit next week to give more time to agree a revised plan for the UK\'s future relationship with the bloc to go alongside her withdrawal agreement. Aides said she would talk "constructively" with her political foe, declining to rule out that a customs union or even a second referendum may be part of a new Brexit plan. "This is a decisive moment in the story of these islands. And it requires national unity to deliver the national interest," the PM said in a televised statement from Downing Street following a marathon seven-hour Cabinet meeting.


Leader of Angela Merkel’s German Christian Democratic Union party, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, has suggested Ireland are to blame for the Brexit stalemate. Speaking with BBC’s Katya Adler, the Europe Editor asked whether Germany might have been willing to add an end date to the controversial backstop mechanism within the withdrawal agreement. BBC’s Adler said: “Isn’t it foolhardy to stay on these very tough red lines in negotiations such as when it came to the famous Irish backstop, that guarantees to keep the Irish border open.
“Wouldn’t it have been more sensible to say ‘yes okay we will put an end date on the backstop’, or ‘we will put it far enough in the future really we don’t think it will be realistic it will ever get to that’. “I have heard internally Germany might have been open to that idea, but there was push back from other member states, particularly Ireland, is that correct?” Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer said: “It was clear from the start that all EU countries wanted to work together. “Particularly listening to the point of view of Ireland and the Irish Government to try to avoid no deal.

It was clear from the start that all EU countries wanted to work together Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer
“But, if the UK now came to us and said ‘let’s spend five-days negotiating non-stop on how to avoid the backstop’, I can’t imagine anyone in Europe saying no. “If there were new watertight proposals for the border, I don’t think anyone in the EU would say we don’t want to talk about it.” Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer added that she likes to think another Brexit referendum “might be possible” but said it “had to be acceptable to the people of the UK”. Members of the Conservative Party’s eurosceptic European Research Group were deeply critical of the backstop element of the withdrawal agreement and it was one of the crucial reasons many of them could not back Mrs May’s agreement. This week the Prime Minister has been meeting with the Labour Party leader after Theresa May reached out to Jeremy Corbyn to help try and get Britain’s exit from the EU over the line.
The move from the Prime Minister enraged a number of Conservative Party colleagues with some in the Tory party’s European Research Group calling for Mrs May to step down. On Friday, Mrs May wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to Article 50 until June 30. The Prime Minister said she will seek to ratify her withdrawal agreement before the European Parliament elections on May 23, but will make "responsible preparations" to take part if that does not prove possible. In her letter, she wrote: "I am writing, therefore, to inform the European Council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty. "The United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June 2019. If the parties are able to ratify before this date, the Government proposes that the period should be terminated early.


Jacob Rees-Mogg was quizzed on BBC’s Today programme about retweeting a video of German AfD co-leader Alice Weidel speaking in Germany’s parliament about Brexit. The far-right AfD is Germany’s main opposition party and has campaigned for tougher immigration controls. In response, Jacob Rees-Mogg claimed it was “typical” of the Today programme to ask him about the tweet as he brought up BBC radio presenter James Naughtie who apologised after comparing the European Research Group to France’s National Front.
Speaking on Today, BBC’s Mishal Husain said: “I want to ask you about what you did the other day in retweeting and drawing attention to something which the AfD put out. “I know you have been asked about this quite a few times. And you have said so far that you don’t agree with everything that they stand for but you wanted to draw attention to this. “You have nevertheless chosen to shine a spotlight on a party whose core principles are anti-immigration and anti-Islam, whose leader in the German Parliament views include Germany being overrun by Arabs and Roma. “Is there nothing in that which gives you pause for thought, that at least you should clarify when you put out and say that you don’t support their other beliefs?”
BBC\'s Mishal Husain clashed with Jacob Rees-Mogg on Today
Mr Rees-Mogg replied: “Well, I think this is typical of the BBC’s obsession, dare I say it, the Today programme’s obsession about this. “Mr Naughtie quite shamefully said the other week that the ERG was like the National Front in France. He said it himself, it was his view. He is a BBC person, he is paid by the license fee.” The BBC presenter stepped in demanding Mr Rees-Mogg answer the question, enraging the Conservative Party Brexiteer. The Tory MP said: “I am coming to the question. You must be patient and not interrupt so much because the answer needs to be given properly. “The BBC does have this obsession. What Mr Naughtie said was an outrageous slur and he wasn’t challenged by whoever was interviewing him. That wasn’t raised.”
That to me seems typical of the Today programme’s leftie approach Jacob Rees-Mogg
Ms Husain claimed the remark from Mr Naughtie was not “his view”, before Mr Rees-Mogg added: “Well it was a view he expressed. “When Mr Naughtie quotes someone, and it is not his view, that’s fine. When I quote somebody and it is not my view, that’s a great shock. “That to me seems typical of the Today programme’s leftie approach. An obsession with this issue.” Mr Rees-Mogg posted a video on Sunday of the German AfD co-leader Alice Weidel speaking in Germany\'s parliament. Alongside the video, the Tory MP wrote: "The AfD leader asks \'Is it any wonder the British see bad faith behind every manoeuvre from Brussels?\'"
Labour MP for Tottenham David Lammy responded to the Tweet, claiming Mr Rees-Mogg was “promoting Germany\'s overtly racist party, AfD". He wrote: “Jacob Rees-Mogg promoting Germany\'s overtly racist party, AfD. Our country\'s proudest moment was defeating the far-right. Now we are supposed to sit back while xenophobes, nativists, nationalists & isolationists do their best to tear Europe apart again. We must not let them win.” Speaking on LBC on Monday, Rees-Mogg said: “I\'m not supporting the AfD. But this is a speech in the Bundestag of real importance because it shows a German view of Brexit.” In March, BBC host James Naughtie sparked fury and apologised after likening members of the ERG to France’s National Front.


Prime Minister Theresa May secured a six-month Brexit delay this week after she wrote to the European Council President asking for an extension to Article 50 last week. But, the decision angered some Conservative Brexit supporters, with Sir Bill Cash standing up in the Commons on Thursday asking when the Prime Minister will resign. Speaking on BBC News, professor Matthew Goodwin, claimed the Prime Minister will “almost certainly” face a “renewed” attempt by MPs to oust her during the six-month period.
He said: “On one level you could argue that this extension gives Mrs May a bit more room for manoeuvre. “That the pressure, at least in the short term, is off and she can get on with those talks with the Labour Party, which we just heard are ongoing today.” He added: “But, of course, seen from the perspective of the Conservative Party, Mrs May coming back with yet another extension, is a more diminished figure. “Somebody who is almost certainly now going to face a renewed attempt to have her stand down and make way for somebody else.”

Mrs May promised her own MPs last month that she will not lead the next stage of the Brexit process and would stand down as leader once her deal passes through the Commons. On Thursday prominent Tory Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash accused the Prime Minister of "abject surrender" to the EU and asked if she would resign. Mrs May replied: "I think you know the answer to that." Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, the Prime Minister told MPs it was their "national duty" to agree to a Brexit deal.
She said: “We need to resolve this. So that we can leave the European Union with a deal as soon as possible. “So that we can avoid having to hold those European Parliamentary elections. And above all, so that we can fulfil the democratic decision of the referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward. “This is our national duty as elected members of this House - and nothing today is more pressing or more vital.” Responding to the Prime Minister, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: "Yesterday EU leaders agreed to grant the United Kingdom an Article 50 extension until the 31st of October.

BRUSSELS (AP) — The Latest on Britain\'s exit from the European Union (all times local):
11:35 a.m.
Groups representing manufacturers in the U.K. and across the continent have appealed to European leaders to work with Britain to avoid a divorce from the bloc without a deal.
Make UK and sister organization Ceemet issued a joint letter to heads of state and chief negotiator Michel Barnier warning of economic shock in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The groups say that while they recognize efforts have been made to address the chaos that a no-deal scenario would cause, "it must be clear that neither the EU nor the UK are ready, and as a consequence European industry is also not adequately prepared, for this cliff edge scenario."
Prime Minister Theresa May travels to Brussels Wednesday to ask for another extension to Britain\'s departure, until June 30. Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU on Friday.
___
9:30 a.m.
European Council President Donald Tusk is meeting leaders including British Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of an emergency summit to decide whether to grant the United Kingdom a further delay in its departure from the European Union.
Donald Tusk meets the leaders of Lithuania, Latvia, The Netherlands and finally May shortly before Wednesday evening\'s summit begins.
It\'s likely to be a rough day for the embattled British leader as she pleads for a second extension until June 30, to prevent Britain\'s departure now scheduled for Friday.
Tusk has suggested an even longer delay of up to a year with conditions attached to ensure Britain does not stymie EU decision making if it remains a member.
EU countries have become increasingly exasperated with the political division and uncertainty in Britain.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on Brexit (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
European Council President Donald Tusk has urged European Union member states to offer the U.K. a flexible extension of up to a year to make sure the nation doesn\'t crash out of the bloc in a chaotic and costly way.
Two EU officials, who requested anonymity because they weren\'t authorized to disclose information before it was made public, said that Tusk wants a one-year "Flextention" and get it approved at next Wednesday\'s EU summit.
Such a move would mean that the U.K. needs to take part in the May 23-26 European elections, something which British Prime Minister Theresa May has long argued against.
May asked Tusk for a short extension until June 30 earlier Friday. Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU on April 12.

Prime Minister Theresa May says Britain will make contingency plans to take part in European Parliament elections in May if no Brexit deal is reached in the interim.
She said in her letter Friday to the EU that she is making these preparations even though she believes it\'s not in Britain\'s interest or the European Union\'s interest for Britain to take part in the elections because it is a departing member state.
May says she "accepts" the EU position that if Britain hasn\'t left the 28-nation bloc by May 23, it will have a legal obligation to take part in the elections.
The prime minister says she is still hopeful of reaching a compromise agreement that could take Britain out of the EU before that time.

9:20 a.m.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is requesting that the deadline for her country to leave the European Union be extended until June 30.
In a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk Friday, May said that "the United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June, 2019."
EU leaders agreed late last month to prolong the Brexit date from March 29 until April 12, unless May could push their mutually agreed divorce deal through Parliament.
The Europeans would prefer that Britain don\'t take part in the May 23-26 EU elections if it is going to leave. April 12 is the last day for Britain to signal whether it will field candidates.

BRUSSELS (AP) — The Latest on Britain\'s exit from the European Union (all times local):
11:35 a.m.
Groups representing manufacturers in the U.K. and across the continent have appealed to European leaders to work with Britain to avoid a divorce from the bloc without a deal.
Make UK and sister organization Ceemet issued a joint letter to heads of state and chief negotiator Michel Barnier warning of economic shock in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The groups say that while they recognize efforts have been made to address the chaos that a no-deal scenario would cause, "it must be clear that neither the EU nor the UK are ready, and as a consequence European industry is also not adequately prepared, for this cliff edge scenario."
Prime Minister Theresa May travels to Brussels Wednesday to ask for another extension to Britain\'s departure, until June 30. Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU on Friday.
___
9:30 a.m.
European Council President Donald Tusk is meeting leaders including British Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of an emergency summit to decide whether to grant the United Kingdom a further delay in its departure from the European Union.
Donald Tusk meets the leaders of Lithuania, Latvia, The Netherlands and finally May shortly before Wednesday evening\'s summit begins.
It\'s likely to be a rough day for the embattled British leader as she pleads for a second extension until June 30, to prevent Britain\'s departure now scheduled for Friday.
Tusk has suggested an even longer delay of up to a year with conditions attached to ensure Britain does not stymie EU decision making if it remains a member.
EU countries have become increasingly exasperated with the political division and uncertainty in Britain.


There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of tourist information in\xc2\xa0Sardinia\xc2\xa0that tells you the Gola su Gorropu is the deepest gorge in Europe. It\xe2\x80\x99s not (see below). But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter when you\xe2\x80\x99re standing at the bottom of an almighty vertical wall of rock and there\xe2\x80\x99s a climber dangling from a precarious handhold high above your head.
Did I say vertical? At this point, the wall \xe2\x80\x93 all 1,300ft of it \xe2\x80\x93 leans oppressively inwards. Just a few yards away, the opposite cliff soars skywards and in between is a traffic jam of car-sized boulders, as white and smooth as pebbles.
Looking up, the cobalt sky is a narrow ribbon between the rims.
Folklore says that you can see stars during the daytime. Unlikely, but not as fanciful as the legend that tells of evil creatures creeping out of the gorge at night to steal away men and animals.
I love these tales; they sit nicely with my own vivid impressions of Sardinia\xe2\x80\x99s natural poster boy. Viewed from both the other side of the valley and down in the gorge\xe2\x80\x99s dungeons, Gorropu looks like it was cut with a broken hacksaw blade. It splits apart the formidable Supramonte limestone massif that dominates the east of this great oblong of an island.

BRUSSELS (AP) — The Latest on Britain\'s exit from the European Union (all times local):
12:45 p.m.
The European Union\'s legislature has warned British Prime Minister Theresa May to come to the Brexit summit with clear indications on how she hopes to turn the cross-party talks with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn into a success.
The European Parliament said in a statement Wednesday that May "cannot come empty-handed."
And the legislators told the EU leaders that they have to make sure that Britain will not become obstructionist if a long extension to their departure is granted.
They said the summit "would be advised to provide the U.K. with an extension which should be appropriately framed to respect the principle of sincere cooperation."
The European Parliament will need to approve any deal May reaches with the EU to make it binding.

It\'s likely to be a rough day for the embattled British leader as she pleads for a second extension until June 30, to prevent Britain\'s departure now scheduled for Friday.

A humanitarian vessel with 64 rescued migrants was left stuck in the Mediterranean after Italy\'s Matteo Salvini said it could \'go to Hamburg.\'
Malta refused the ship entry to their waters as it sailed close to the Italian island of Lampedusa on Thursday after the migrants were hauled from the sea on Wednesday.
The Maltese and Italian refusal sets the stage for another Mediterranean stand-off that will only be resolved if European governments agree to accept the asylum-seekers.
Italian Interior Minister Salvini stated on Wednesday the ship could head to Germany but Sea Eye\'s spokeswoman said that was \'out of the question.\'

Carlotta Weibl\xc2\xa0said \'it\'s a journey of 3-4 weeks. We don\'t have food and water.\'\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Weibl said: \'Malta says we can\'t enter their waters and we are unlikely to get permission from Italy.\'
Sea-Eye\'s ship, the Alan Kurdi, rescued the migrants on Wednesday near Libya.\xc2\xa0
It did so as it was looking for a boat with 50 migrants missing since Monday and 40 migrants missing since last week.
\'The chances are low that they are alive,\' Weibl said.
Similar stand-offs in recent months involving rescue ships hoping to reach Italy and Malta were eventually resolved when other EU members agreed to take some of the migrants.
However, many of those people still remain stuck in migrant centres in Malta and Lampedusa.
The Alan Kurdi ship is named after a Kurdish boy who drowned in the sea at the age of three in 2015 as he and his family fled war in Syria.
Women and children are wrapped in blankets after boarding the rescue ship off the coast of Libya on Wednesday

An image of his small lifeless body prompted an outpouring of sympathy for the plight of migrants.
However, since then the mood in Europe has turned.
Weibl said that at the moment, the Alan Kurdi is the only humanitarian ship operating in the Mediterranean because many governments have denied aid ships the permission to operate.


Ireland\'s quest to win a first World Cup has suffered a major setback after Dan Leavy was ruled out of the tournament by a knee injury described by Leinster as \'complex\'.
Leavy lasted only 11 minutes of Saturday\'s Champions Cup quarter-final victory over Ulster before he was carried from the pitch on a stretcher having replaced Sean O\'Brien in the second-half.
The 24-year-old openside had just recovered from the long-term calf injury that forced him to miss the recent Six Nations in which Ireland surrendered their crown to Wales.
Ireland have been dealt a major blow after Dan Leavy was ruled out of this year\'s World Cup
Not only will Leavy be absent for the climax to Leinster\'s bid to defend their European title, he will also sit out Japan 2019 to rehabilitate an injury that will require long-term medical attention.
\'Leinster can confirm that Dan Leavy had an initial scan yesterday on a complex knee ligament injury but needs further assessment this week,\' his province announced.
\'He has been ruled out for the remainder of the season and into next season to include the World Cup.\'
Leavy was superb throughout last year\'s Six Nations as Ireland completed the Grand Slam, but has struggled with injury in the wake of the subsequent summer tour to Australia.
\'Dan worked so hard to get himself back and physically fit,\' Leinster scrum coach John Fogarty said.
\'He\'s such a huge threat on either side of the ball, gives the team a lot confidence so it\'s a big loss for Leinster and Irish rugby. He\'ll make a plan now to get himself back.\'

A Bulgarian coastal resort has been named as the best value destination for a European beach holiday for Brits for the sixth year running.
The Post Office Travel Money Holiday Costs Barometer, which compares costs in 20 European beach resorts, found prices in Sunny Beach have plunged - despite the pound\'s volatility.
Other cheap locations include the Algarve in Portugal as well as the Turkish beach resort of Marmaris.
The Bulgarian coastal resort of Sunny Beach, pictured, has been named as the best value destination for a European beach holiday for Brits
The Post Office Travel Money Holiday Costs Barometer, which compares costs in 20 European beach resorts, found prices in Sunny Beach have plunged
The research found a basket of nine tourist staples - comprising lunch and evening meals, drinks, sun cream and insect repellent - at Sunny Beach is \xc2\xa338.86, which is 10.7 per cent lower than last year.
An evening meal for two with wine will set visitors back around \xc2\xa322, while lunch for two is just over \xc2\xa38 and a cup of coffee weighs in at 70p.
As a result, the overall barometer cost in Sunny Beach is under half that in most other resorts.
There has also been a price fall of 16.2 per cent in the Algarve, although holiday costs are 48 per cent higher than in Bulgaria at \xc2\xa357.45.
However, the Portuguese hot spot is easily the cheapest of 16 eurozone resorts and less than half the price of Sorrento (\xc2\xa3143), the most expensive destination surveyed.
In Marmaris, the total cost of all six items is \xc2\xa359.19 - which is down 8.6 per cent on last year.
Although local costs have risen over 20 per cent, sterling\'s strength against the Turkish lira easily outweighs those price rises.
The biggest fall of over 20 per cent year-on-year was found in Limassol, Cyprus.
The research looked at a basket of nine tourist staples - comprising lunch and evening meals, drinks, sun cream and insect repellent
As a result, Limassol (\xc2\xa394) has moved up to ninth place from 16th last year to join Paphos (7th, \xc2\xa384) in the Holiday Costs Barometer top 10.
Altogether, 14 of the resorts surveyed \xe2\x80\x93 over three-quarters of the 18 resorts which also featured in the report a year ago \xe2\x80\x93 have seen prices fall.
While sterling is currently stronger year-on-year against the euro and other European currencies, the main factor governing the barometer price falls is competitive pricing in restaurants, bars and shops, which has led to lower resort prices.\xc2\xa0
In Spain, Brits will see prices vary significantly.
Torremolinos (fourth) on the Costa del Sol is by far the cheapest of five resorts surveyed by the Post Office this year.
At \xc2\xa366, barometer prices have fallen 8.7 per cent on 2018 levels and are just half of those in Ibiza (19th, \xc2\xa3132), the highest-priced Spanish destination.
Nick Boden, head of Post Office Travel Money, said: \'There are significant variations between the prices we found in resorts this year so it will really pay dividends to do some holiday homework before booking to avoid busting the budget\'
Despite recording a 4.7 per cent fall in barometer costs, Sorrento (\xc2\xa3143) remains the most expensive of 20 destinations
In the Costa Blanca, Benidorm (\xc2\xa378, new for 2019) is fifth cheapest overall.
However, rising prices in neighbouring Alicante (10th, \xc2\xa395) has made it 22 per cent more expensive than Benidorm.
In the Balearic Islands Majorca (\xc2\xa397) has moved up to 11th place on the back of an 11 per cent fall in costs and is 26 per cent cheaper than Ibiza.
There are also big cost variations between the three Greek resorts surveyed.
Crete, sixth in the table, is cheapest at \xc2\xa381 for the tourist staples, while tourists visiting either Halkidiki (\xc2\xa3101, 13th) on the Greek mainland or Corfu (\xc2\xa3104, 14th) can expect to pay over 25 per cent more.
In Croatia, falling prices mean that Porec (\xc2\xa398, 12th) is now a cheaper option than Zadar (\xc2\xa3106, 15th).
This is because prices have fallen 8.6 per cent in the Istrian Peninsula since last year, while they have risen marginally (0.7 per cent) further south in Zadar.
There has been a price fall of 16.2 per cent in the the Algarve, pictured, although holiday costs are 48 per cent higher than in Bulgaria at \xc2\xa357.45
Despite recording a 4.7 per cent fall in barometer costs, Sorrento (\xc2\xa3143) remains the most expensive of 20 destinations.
Further east in southern Italy, Puglia (\xc2\xa3112, 16th, new for 2019) is over 20 per cent cheaper and may offer UK visitors a more affordable holiday option.
Nick Boden, head of Post Office Travel Money, said: \'There are significant variations between the prices we found in resorts this year so it will really pay dividends to do some holiday homework before booking to avoid busting the budget.
\'Compare the barometer prices for meals, drinks and other tourist staples to find a destination that will offer good value for money.\'
While Victoria Bacon, Abta director of brand and business development, explained: \'Europe remains the number one overseas destination for British holidaymakers and this research highlights the amazing value on offer in so many of our holiday favourites.
\'The relative weakness of sterling against the Euro has also meant that increasingly customers are looking for good value in other destinations and Abta members are reporting significant interest in travel to Bulgaria and Turkey. With the incredible prices in resort, revealed in this Post Office report, it\'s easy to see why.\'\xc2\xa0

MADRID, April 3 (Reuters) - Spain\'s Santander said on Wednesday it was focused on cost-savings in its more mature European businesses, while maintaining higher profitability in its Latin America markets.
Santander said it was aiming for incremental annual cost savings of 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in the medium term, of which 1 billion euros would come from Europe.
Europe\'s banks are focused on cost savings as they attempt to offset a squeeze on margins due to low interest rates.
Spain\'s largest bank said as part of its focus on efficiency in Europe it was expecting 250 million euros of additional costs savings in its Spanish business from the integration of Popular.
When it first announced the acquisition of Popular in 2017, Santander said it was expecting cost synergies of close to 500 million euros per year from 2020.
In Britain, Santander\'s third biggest market, it said that as part of its strategy it would focus on cost management and continued risk discipline, without giving out any specifics.
Around 730 million euros of the total cost savings would come from effiency gains in IT and operations and 220 million euros from shared services across regions, including the UK.
The euro zone\'s biggest lender by market value reiterated its target for return on tangible equity (ROTE) - a measure of profitability - of 13-15 percent and a Core Tier 1 fully-loaded capital ratio target of 11-12 percent in the medium term.
Santander shares were up 1.7 percent at 0835 GMT against a 1.5 percent rise on the European STOXX banking index. ($1 = 0.8911 euros) (Reporting by Jes\xc3\xbas Aguado; Editing Paul Day and Alexander Smith)

SINGAPORE, April 10 (Reuters) - Copper on Wednesday eased from a one-week high hit the day before, pressured after the International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecast and as the United States threatened to slap tariffs on hundreds of European goods.
The IMF reduced its forecast for world economic growth this year to 3.3 percent from 3.5 percent previously, citing the U.S.-China trade war and a potentially disorderly British exit from the European Union.
It warned chances of further cuts to the outlook were high.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Trade Representative on Monday proposed slapping tariffs on a list of EU products ranging from large commercial aircraft to dairy products and wine as it kicked off the retaliation process against European aircraft subsidies.
A stronger U.S. dollar on Wednesday also weighed on prices for dollar-denominated metals as it makes them more expensive for countries using other currencies to make purchases.
FUNDAMENTALS
* COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange had fallen 0.1 percent to $6,483.5 a tonne by 0357 GMT, while the most active copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was down 0.1 percent at 49,550 yuan ($7,381.86) a tonne.
* RESISTANCE: "The previous (copper) prices were a little high," said Shanghai-based copper analyst He Tianyu of CRU.
London copper hit $6,540 in the previous session, its strongest since April 1, with He saying that had been a resistance level since February and that he had not seen any signs of a pick up in demand.
* PERU: An indigenous community in Peru voted to suspend its two-month road blockade of MMG Ltd\'s Las Bambas copper mine for two days until the government visits the region on Thursday, an advisor to the community told Reuters.
* PRICES: London aluminium dipped 0.1 percent, while zinc climbed 0.3 percent and lead rose 0.5 percent. Shanghai zinc was on track for its third straight decline, down 0.7 percent, and lead was down 0.7 percent.

April 1 (Reuters) - European shares were on course for their biggest daily gain in eight weeks on Monday, as a surprise recovery in China\'s factory data and signs of progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks boosted investor sentiment on the first trading day of second quarter.
Following the best quarterly performance in four years, the pan-European index climbed 0.9 percent at 0922 GMT, with all major sectors higher.
While gains spread across all regional bourses, Germany\'s trade-sensitive DAX outperformed with its 1.3 percent rise, helped by 3 percent jump in auto stocks which were set for their best daily surge since Jan. 4.
Peugeot SA rose about 3 percent while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles gained 1.6 percent on a report that the two companies are exploring a partnership to share investments to build cars in Europe.
European chip stocks were another bright spot after better-than-expected results from Apple-supplier Foxconn Industrial.
Shares in Dialog Semiconductor Plc, Infineon Technologies, Ams AG and Siltronic AG and STMicroelectronics N.V. rose between 3 percent and 5 percent.
The upbeat mood spilled over from Asian markets, after both official and private surveys showed factory activity in China unexpectedly grew for the first time in four months in March.
China\'s economic data comes on the heels of fresh concerns over a slowing world economy that resurfaced last month after the U.S. Federal Reserve abruptly ended its plans for policy tightening this year and signals from the bond market of an imminent recession.
"The economic growth in China will strengthen from here and that is the strongest signal which is driving the markets today," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at TF Global Markets (UK) Ltd in London.
In contrast, markets seemed to shrug off a survey that found factories in the euro zone had their worst month in March for almost six years. Another survey showed Germany\'s Markit\'s Purchasing Managers\' Index (PMI) for manufacturing fell to an 80-month low reading of 44.1.
"The German number is nothing short of a disaster. We are talking of recession territory over here and this is a huge concern for the European Central Bank. But for the markets today, the focus is on China and the optimism around it," Aslam said.
Adding to the buoyant mood, China said over the weekend that it would continue to suspend additional tariffs on U.S. vehicles and auto parts after April 1, the latest sign of optimism as the world\'s two largest economies work out a deal to end their trade dispute.
Swiss logistics group Panalpina jumped 14 percent on bowing to an increased 4.6 billion Swiss francs ($4.6 billion) bid from Danish rival DSV, ending a more than two-month takeover battle designed to build scale in the consolidating transport sector.
EasyJet slipped 7 percent, among the biggest decliners on the STOXX, after the British low-cost airline warned that demand and pricing were suffering from Brexit jitters and a weaker economic outlook.
Ryanair Holdings also shed over 3 percent.
London\'s FTSE 100 and the Dublin bourse, often seen as a barometer for Brexit sentiment, rose 0.7 percent each.
Britain\'s exit from the European Union was in disarray after a third defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May\'s divorce deal left her under pressure from rival factions to leave without a deal, go for an election or forge a much softer divorce.
Parliament will vote on different Brexit options on Monday and then May could try to bring her deal back to a vote in parliament one more time, possibly as early as Tuesday.
Goldman Sachs says the balance of risks around Brexit outcomes is tilted towards a softer, longer departure from the European Union, after a May\'s withdrawal agreement was rejected for a third time. (Reporting by Medha Singh and Agamoni Ghosh in Bengaluru Editing by Peter Graff and Jon Boyle)


ROME, April 10 (Reuters) - Italian industrial output was much stronger than expected in February, rising 0.8 percent from the month before and consolidating a jump in January, data showed on Wednesday. The data some offers hope that Italy\'s shallow recession over the second half of last year may be short lived. February\'s output was stronger than all 19 forecasts in a Reuters survey of analysts which had pointed to a 0.8 percent decline. National statistics institute ISTAT revised up January\'s data, which was also beat expectations, to show a 1.9 percent month-on-month rise, originally reported as +1.7 percent. Industrial output had not posted two consecutive monthly rises since June last year. However, in the three months to February, output in the euro zone\'s third largest economy was still down 0.3 percent compared with the September-to-November period, ISTAT said. On a work-day adjusted year-on-year basis, output in February was up 0.9 percent, following a 0.8 percent fall in January, posting the first year-on-year rise since October. By broad product sector, output in February showed monthly rises for consumer goods, investment goods and intermediate goods, partly offset by a decline in output of energy products. The ruling coalition of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League on Tuesday cut its forecast for 2019 GDP growth to just 0.2 percent from a target of 1.0 percent set in December. Italian industrial output fell by around a quarter during a steep double dip recession between 2008 and 2013, and has regained only a small part of that during a modest recovery in the subsequent years. ISTAT gave the following details. INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION FEB JAN DEC Mth/mth pct change (adjusted) 0.8 1.9r -0.7 Yr/yr pct change (adjusted) 0.9 -0.8 -5.7r Yr/yr pct change (unadjusted) 0.9 -0.8r -2.7r NOTE: BASE 2015=100. (r) indicates revised figures. ISTAT provided the following breakdown by broad product group in February: adjusted month-on-month percent change Consumer goods 3.2 Investment goods 1.1 Intermediate goods 0.2 Energy goods -2.4


Millions of Brits will be able to head to the Mediterranean for their summer holidays without needing a visa even if there is a No Deal Brexit.
Euro-MPs in Brussels today ruled that anyone travelling to the border-free main part of the EU for less than 90 days will not need the costly travel document.
This includes popular holiday destinations like Spain, Greece, Portugal, Italy, Malta and France which are visited by huge numbers of UK tourists every year.\xc2\xa0
Implementation will depend on Britain granting EU citizens the same rights in return, but London has said it will do so and the principle of the law has broad support.
The news is a welcome boost for British travellers after the EU yesterday made a swipe for home comfort foods like Cornish pasties and pork pies.
Ham, sausages and cheese are among products that could be barred from being taken to the continent if the UK leaves without a deal under hardcore disease control rules.
The European Parliament passed the new law governing British travellers in Europe by more than 400 votes in Brussels.\xc2\xa0
But the law giving Britons 90 days of visa-free travel to countries like Spain, France and Greece also referred to Gibraltar as a colony, despite British anger
A senior European Commissioner warned that luggage checks would come into force at all EU borders points immediately if the UK left without a deal at any time.
If the rules were heavily policed it could mean travellers either leaving their beloved comfort snacks behind or find a way of smuggling them past border guards.\xc2\xa0
\'You will have to pick and choose what you are bringing from the UK. Any animal based product you will not want to put into your luggage. No import of any ham, sausage or other delicacies. That\'s the end of that,\' a Brussels official told the Telegraph.
The visa law was passed by the European Parliament with a massive 502-81 but it is likely to spark some fury in Britain.
EU member states - at Spain\'s urging - referred in a footnote to the draft to Gibraltar as a "colony of the British crown".
The United Nations does legally list Gibraltar as a "non-self-governing territory", but Britain insists it is part of "the UK family" and that its citizens freely voted to remain British.
The reference upset the UK and held up the bill, which had already been approved by the European Commission.\xc2\xa0
Gibraltarians, whose economy depends on an open border with Spain, voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU in Britain\'s 2016 referendum.\xc2\xa0
Spain, which is holding national elections on April 28, sees Brexit as a chance to rally the rest of the EU behind its claim to the territory of 33,000 inhabitants.
It has already secured a right of veto over whether future Brexit arrangements can apply to Gibraltar once Britain has left the EU.


European football\xe2\x80\x99s crackdown against racist behaviour by supporters has continued with punishments for Croatian champions GNK Dinamo and Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s Dynamo Kiev.
Last week, UEFA ordered Italy\xe2\x80\x99s Lazio, Ukrainian champions Shakhtar Donetsk and Czech side Slavia Prague to play their next home European ties in front of partially closed stadiums following racist chanting and other crowd disturbances in recent Europa League matches.
And on Monday, UEFA\xe2\x80\x99s control, ethics and disciplinary body ruled that GNK Dinamo\xe2\x80\x99s next two home games in European competition should take place behind closed doors, with the second of those games deferred for two years, while Dynamo Kiev were given the lesser sanction of a partial closure.
GNK Dinamo\xe2\x80\x99s offences took place during the first leg of the last-16 game against Benfica last month and they were also fined \xc2\xa340,000 for their fans setting off fireworks, throwing objects and blocking stairways, with a further \xc2\xa317,000 levied for the racism.
Dynamo Kiev were also charged with a range of offences, including racist behaviour, following their last-32 game against Olympiakos in February but, as this was a first offence, they were treated more leniently.
The Ukrainians came through that tie but were then soundly beaten by Chelsea in the last 16, although the Premier League side were also sanctioned by UEFA on Monday for the behaviour of their fans in their last-32 game against Malmo in Sweden on February 14.

The Blues were given a \xc2\xa311,000 fine for their fans throwing objects and invading the pitch, while their hosts were hit with a \xc2\xa349,000 fine because their supporters also threw objects and set off fireworks.
Monday\xe2\x80\x99s punishments for racist behaviour come a week after several England players were racially abused by Montenegro fans during their Euro 2020 qualifier in Podgorica and on the eve of a two-day anti-discrimination conference at Wembley co-hosted by UEFA, the Football Association and European campaign group Fare Network.


Speculators are betting heavily on a fall in the euro amid woeful economic data from Germany, its powerhouse nation.
Hedge funds and other trading firms are short-selling \xc2\xa310.7 billion of euros, according to research by Goldman Sachs \xe2\x80\x93 meaning they make money if the value of the currency falls.
The sum is \xc2\xa32 billion more than a week ago, suggesting investors are increasingly gloomy about the future prospects of the monetary union.
Woeful performance: Hedge funds and other trading firms are short-selling \xc2\xa310.7 billion of euros as Angela Merkel\'s Germany flounders
And more dismal figures cast doubt on the German economy. Exports by firms in the country fell 1.3 per cent in February, according to the Federal Statistics Office, while imports dropped 1.6 per cent.
Both falls were worse than analysts had expected, and are thought to be driven by a crackdown on global trade by the US under President Trump.
Germany\'s prized car making industry is also suffering as customers shun diesel models over fears they cause dangerous pollution.
Figures last week showed that manufacturing and industrial production were both also down in February.
Carsten Brzeski, of investment bank ING, said: \'There simply seem to be too many crises in global trade for the German export sector to defy all of them at the same time.\'

An Irish ex-bikie who has lived in Australia since he was six years old, but has spent time behind bars, will be deported after his visa was cancelled and his appeal rejected in the Federal Court.
John Paul Pennie, who moved to Australia with his parents in 1980, was sentenced in July 2015 to four-and-a-half years in a West Australian prison for charges including possessing methylamphetamine with intent to sell or supply and wilful destruction of evidence.
In January 2016, a delegate of the home affairs minister cancelled Pennie\'s visa, ruling he did not pass the character test due to his criminal record which included being a former vice president of the Bandidos bikies.
After the minister refused to revoke the cancellation, Pennie took his case to the Federal Court but on Thursday his application was rejected.
Pennie had claimed he feared a lack of medical care for his health issues in Ireland and that he would be homeless.
But Justice Katrina Banks-Smith said the minister had considered possible hardship and had not made an error.
Pennie also argued he did not pose an unacceptable risk to the Australian community, in part because he had severed ties with the Bandidos.
After Pennie announced he was leaving the club, he was told he had to stab a fellow inmate and assault another, but he refused, which led to Pennie being attacked in Casuarina prison.
"Different minds might reach different conclusions as to the likelihood of the applicant being exposed to contact with the Bandidos Motorcycle Club upon release into the community and the relevance of such exposure to the risk of harm to the Australian community," Justice Banks-Smith said.
"But that does not mean the minister\'s views can be described as illogical or irrational."


MILAN, April 5 (Reuters) - Italy\'s government, which owns 68 percent of Banca Monte dei Paschi, will assess whether to back a possible shareholder request to seek damages from the Tuscan bank\'s former top executives, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said.
"We\'ll discuss and see what to do next week at the shareholder meeting," he told journalists on the sidelines of an event. "As far as I\'m concerned, those who have hurt the bank should pay."
Monte dei Paschi holds its annual general meeting on Thursday and activist investor Bluebell Partners has said it will ask shareholders to vote in favour of a damage request against former Chief Executive Fabrizio Viola and Chairman Alessandro Profumo.
Viola and Profumo were in charge at the time when Monte dei Paschi failed to raise capital on the market and turned to the state for help.
Bluebell Partners representative Giuseppe Bivona has asked the economy ministry in a letter seen by Reuters to back his request at next week\'s AGM.
Bluebell said in the letter it would also assess whether to seek damages from current CEO Marco Morelli and Chairwoman Stefania Bariatti, depending on answers they give to questions on the bank\'s 2018\'s financial statements Bluebell plans to raise at the meeting.

Campaigners for victims in Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s worst ever fire have lodged an appeal for a fresh inquest.
The Stardust Campaign group has petitioned for a new inquest into the fire with Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney General, 38 years after their tragedy.
The Stardust Justice Campaign have petitioned the Attorney General for a new inquest today. @darraghmackin says the threshold for a new inquest has been met by the evidence they have submitted. pic.twitter.com/KGbHFDZB43 \xe2\x80\x94 aoife-grace moore. (@aoifegracemoore) April 2, 2019
Forty eight people lost their lives in the fire at the popular Stardust nightclub in Artane, Dublin at a Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day disco.
Campaigners say fresh evidence and new witness statements about the night of the fire provide enough assurance that a new inquest should be opened.
Only one emergency phone call is on public record from the night of the fire, but campaigners say they now have a signed statement from a woman who claims she made a second call about a fire on the roof of the nightclub.
The group also says it has evidence that the Electrical Supply Board had written to the owners of the Stardust about faulty electrical wiring before the fire occurred, all of which, it says, is crucial to the timing and cause of the fire.

Officials originally ruled that the cause of the fire was arson, a theory that was never accepted by the families.
Despite findings of safety breaches, there were no prosecutions over the incident.
Investigations into the fire showed that a number of escape routes from the dance hall were blocked as emergency doors were locked by chains, concerns have also been raised about the investigation of the scene, which allowed politicians and media to walk through the building just days after the fire.
Darragh Mackin, from Phoenix Law, and a solicitor for the families, says it has consulted experts from those involved with the Grenfell fire in London, and the 9/11 terror attacks.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe threshold for a fresh inquest is relatively modest, it is whether or not the Attorney General feels it is advisable, we say that is clear by the evidence presented to him today that the test is met,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.
\xe2\x80\x9cIn the opinion of the experts, a fresh inquest is advisable and can get to the bottom of what happened in the Stardust.
\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s greatest atrocity, and the truth is the very least these families deserve.\xe2\x80\x9d
Antoinette Keegan, who survived the fire but lost her sisters Mary and Martina in the blaze, says the families have never felt so confident.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe want truth and we want justice, it\xe2\x80\x99s not fair on the parents of their loved ones, Mrs (Bridget) McDermott is not well, my mother is 83, it\xe2\x80\x99s not fair how long this has continued.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s systematic abuse that the government has thrown at the families and it\xe2\x80\x99s time now it stops and we get the truth and justice we\xe2\x80\x99re entitled to.\xe2\x80\x9d
Mrs McDermott lost three children in the tragedy.
The Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar is due to meet the group on May 29, and previously said he would discuss the matter with the Attorney General after the petition had been submitted.
\xe2\x80\x9cSuccessive governments have failed, the Taoiseach has a responsibility, he has promised it so he has to fulfil it.\xe2\x80\x9d
Sinn Fein MEP Lynn Boylan has taken up the cause with the families, and says that it is unacceptable that the families had to find the new evidence themselves, with no legal aid.
A 2017 report by retired judge Pat McCartan found\xc2\xa0it was evident the fire was in the roof space, not a seat as previously stated, and that there were witnesses who had not been interviewed.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe McCartan report acknowledged there were witnesses out there but bizarrely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to find or question those witnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.
\xe2\x80\x9cSo we have a report that says there are witnesses out there with evidence that would counter what previous inquests have found, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to go and find them and it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the families to go find that evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d
The campaign group says it is unknown how long the Attorney General will take in making a decision but they are hopeful that a judgment can be made before the end of the summer.


MILAN, April 5 (Reuters) - The European Union needs to sign as soon as possible a deal with the United States to lower tariffs on the struggling automotive sector, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Friday.
"Europe must sign an agreement with the United States on the automotive to lower some tariffs soon", Di Maio said.
Di Maio said that the European economy was suffering mostly due to Germany\'s economic slowdown, which in turn was being driven by U.S.-Chinese trade tensions and the problems of the automotive sector.
"I\'m not looking for alibis but exports are one thing we can work on to boost growth," he said.

BRUSSELS, April 4 (Reuters) - The largest ever money laundering scandal in Europe is rippling through the region\'s banks.
It began in the Baltics and has engulfed several Nordic lenders, notably Denmark\'s Danske and Sweden\'s Swedbank, who had large Baltic operations.
Here are some facts about Europe\'s problems.
HOW DID THE CURRENT SCANDAL EMERGE?
The Baltics\' proximity to Russia has traditionally made them vulnerable to illegal financial flows from their neighbour.
U.S. investigators raised concerns about some of the region\'s banks early last year, prompting domestic and European watchdogs to investigate.
WHICH BANKS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED SO FAR?
The first to be hit was Latvia\'s ABLV, which was liquidated last year after U.S. accusations of money-laundering activities.
The scandal spread to the Estonian branch of Danske Bank , Denmark\'s largest lender, which is now facing probes in several countries for handling 200 billion euros ($224 billion) in suspicious transactions of Russian money between 2007 and 2015.
Sweden\'s Swedbank has recently been drawn into the scandal, after it was reported it handled some of the same payments that went through Danske, leading to the dismissal of its chief executive last week.
COULD IT SPREAD TO BANKS BEYOND THE BALTICS AND NORDICS? Other lenders that helped process suspicious payments from the Baltics could also be in the frame. Deutsche Bank, which acted as a correspondent bank to Danske, is under investigation over its links to the money.
IS THE PROBLEM LIMITED TO FLOWS FROM RUSSIA TO THE BALTICS? Money from Russia and former Soviet Union countries does not only go to the Baltics. Cyprus and Malta are among the EU states that are most welcoming of these flows, data show, with Pilatus Bank in Malta shut down last year following a U.S. probe on its owner and after allegations of suspicious transactions involving Azerbaijan\'s ruling elite.
But the problem is not limited to Russian flows. EU-based criminal organisations, such as Italian mafias, launder most of their illegal proceeds in the largest EU states, estimates show.
ING, the Netherlands\' largest financial services provider, was forced by the Dutch regulator to pay a $915 million fine last year over money laundering. Its Italian business is also under investigation over similar allegations.
HOW MUCH COULD THIS COST BANKS?
A lot. EU banks payed over $16 billion in fines between 2012 and 2018 because of lax money-laundering checks, rating agency Moody\'s said in a report on Tuesday, with U.S. regulators levying more than 75 percent of those fines.
Now the allegations have stepped up, so could the fines. WHO SUPERVISES THIS AND WHY DID SO MUCH MONEY GET LAUNDERED? Despite money-laundering being a cross-border crime, it is not tackled at EU level but almost exclusively by national authorities, who often lack the capabilities to counter it.
In some cases domestic supervisors have shown little interest in acting, as reputational damages could hit national economies. Malta\'s financial supervisor has been found in breach of EU law over the Pilatus case, and the EU is investigating the Estonian regulator after the Danske scandal.
Many banks do not report all suspicious transactions as their due-diligence units are often understaffed.
Reports are not standardised, often producing irrelevant data and hampering cooperation among national supervisors.
WHAT ARE THE DIFFICULTIES IN DETECTING THESE FLOWS?
EU rules to fight money laundering have been overhauled, but some loopholes have never been closed. They are also applied differently and EU states are often late in executing them.
States, including Luxembourg and Germany, use loopholes in EU rules that allow them not to disclose fines on banks in breach of money-laundering rules. This vastly reduces the effectiveness of sanctions which are mostly feared by lenders for their reputational impact.
In the latest reforms, EU legislators added stricter transparency requirements on companies\' owners, but allowed them to remain hidden in some cases. Money-laundering is often conducted through shell firms whose owners are unknown.
Data that could raise alarm bells, such as the share of non-resident deposits or oversized cross-border flows, are collected at national level, often without details of final beneficiaries. No-one checks them at EU level.
The EU has also failed to agree an updated list of jurisdictions that pose money-laundering risks because of lax rules. This reduces banks\' ability to spot dodgy payments .

April 10 (Reuters) - AT&T has internally discussed about selling its HBO Europe business as the telecom group aims to reduce a debt pile of $170 billion, the Financial times reported, citing current and former senior executives.
Comcast-owned Sky would be an "obvious buyer" given its relationship with HBO, the paper said https://on.ft.com/2WWtl07, citing people at AT&T and HBO. Sky distributes HBO content in the UK, Germany and Italy.
HBO became part of AT&T after the telecom group closed its $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc last year.
HBO Europe is one of several assets AT&T has considered selling but has not held formal talks with any potential buyers, the paper added.
In November, AT&T said it had committed to cutting its heavy debt load in 2019 through a variety of measures, including a review of all of its non-core assets such as its stake in streaming video company Hulu for possible sale.
AT&T and Comcast did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report. (Reporting by Philip George and Ishita Palli in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)


MILAN (AP) - The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says it is asking Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a safe port for the 64 migrants it rescued off Libya earlier this week.
Sea-Watch spokesman Carlotta Weibl said Friday that the rescue boat Alan Kurdi remains in international waters off Lampedusa and will not approach Italy\'s southernmost island until it has permission.
She said conditions on board were worsening and that a storm was approaching. She said a request has been made to the German foreign ministry to find a solution.
Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers to pack unseaworthy rubber dinghies with migrants looking for sanctuary in Europe.

Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, pictured February 2019, said that his country would continue to pressure European countries to act on their obligations within the Iran nuclear deal but added that "we never had any hopes" in them
Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said on Wednesday European powers were incapable of bypassing sanctions imposed on Tehran by the US after it withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal.
Iran and six world powers agreed on a deal in 2015 that severely restricted Tehran\'s nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief and economic incentives.
However President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from the deal -- technically called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) -- last May, reimposing punishing sanctions on the Islamic republic.
The other parties to the nuclear deal -- Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia along with the European Union -- however insist they remain committed to making the deal work.
"The Europeans at first viewed the JCPOA (nuclear deal) as an achievement, but maybe they were not prepared to, and certainly they were not capable of standing up against U.S sanctions," Zarif said in an interview with Khamenei.ir, the official website of Iran\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
"We will continue pressing the Europeans to implement their commitments. Europe must know that they cannot shy away from their responsibilities with a few statements and some unaccomplished plans," he added.
Zarif, who was his country\'s chief negotiator in the negotiations leading to the deal, said that Iran would continue to pressure the Europeans to act on their obligations within the deal but added that "we never had any hopes" in them.
Instead of the western powers the Islamic republic has turned to its traditional partners such as Russia and China, Zarif said, adding "the future of our foreign policy lies in that way."


BERLIN (AP) - Germany\'s environment minister says the government will discuss introducing a carbon tax as part of its national plan to curb climate change.
Speaking after the first meeting of a special "climate Cabinet," German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Wednesday that government ministers would, over the coming months, put forward proposals for cutting greenhouse gases in the areas they oversee.
Germany\'s transport ministry opposes sector-specific targets, but Schulze insisted "everyone will have to shoulder some of the responsibility."
She also displayed openness to some kind of carbon tax. Other countries have already introduced carbon pricing to discourage the burning of fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases and stoke global warming.
Schulze said of such carbon taxes that "there are many different models that will also be debated in Cabinet."

MILAN, April 11 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has pushed back a deadline to submit binding bids for troubled Italian lender Carige to mid-May so as to give a specialist fund run by BlackRock more time, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The BlackRock fund has remained as the only buyer still known to be considering a bid. One of the sources said it needed more time to study a possible offer, given all the moving parts involved.
Carige was placed under special administration at the start of the year after its top investor blocked a planned capital raising, derailing an industry-financed rescue plan.
The ECB has extended by six weeks an original April 5 deadline, one source said. The first source said there was no set deadline but "a process made up of several steps which is expected to conclude in the first part of May."

Marco Reus has revealed Mesut Ozil is the best player he has ever lined up alongside for Germany.
The pair played together at international level for seven years before the Arsenal playmaker retired last summer.\xc2\xa0
Ozil has started the club\'s last four matches after previously flitting in and out of Unai Emery\'s side this season.
Marco Reus (R) revealed Mesut Ozil is the best player he has lined up alongside for Germany
The 30-year-old was praised by his manager following the Gunners\' win over Newcastle on Monday night and now Reus has also hailed him.
The Borussia Dortmund forward was asked \'who is the best national team player you\'ve played with?\'
\'Mesut Ozil,\' he told Copa 90.\xc2\xa0\'The way he creates goals... he\'s a player with a really good eye for his team-mates.
Ozil has started Arsenal\'s last four matches after previously flitting in and out of the side
\'He has so many assists in the Premier League and with the national team.
\'He\'s just an intelligent player and you can see that right away with a first glance. I always enjoyed playing with him and that\'s why it\'s a pity he\'s taken a step back.
\'I hope he\'ll get back to form and return to playing regularly for Arsenal.\'
Arsenal have leapfrogged Tottenham into third place in the Premier League table as they look to secure a Champions League qualification spot.


AIGLE, Switzerland (AP) - The International Cycling Union says cyclocross rider Denise Betsema tested positive for an anabolic steroid and is provisionally suspended.
Betsema, 26, placed fourth at the women\'s world championships race in February, when she was edged out of the medals by her Netherlands teammate Marianne Vos.
The UCI says Betsema tested positive one week earlier at a World Cup event in her home country.
Cycling\'s governing body did not specify which steroid she allegedly used.
No timetable was given by the UCI to prosecute the disciplinary case.
Betsema took bronze in the European Championships last year.

A giant deer-eating owl that could crush a child with its claws is on the loose in Ireland after escaping from its pen.\xc2\xa0
Locals are being warned not to go near the Eurasian eagle owl which vanished from its home in Kildare after being startled by a cat.
The powerful owl, called Tank, has a 6.5ft wingspan and feeds on deer, rodents and other birds.\xc2\xa0
Owner Darren Jackson has warned people to stay away from his Eurasian eagle owl which escaped from his home in Kildare
The powerful owl, called Tank, has a 6.5ft wingspan and feeds on deer, rodents and other birds. It could easily crush a child with its sharp claws
Darren Jackson, who has owned the owl since she was ten days old, said on social media: \'She may pose a threat to people or children if someone went to pick her up.\xc2\xa0
\'Each of her claws would have a tonne per point. She has four claws, so that\'s four tonnes of pressure.
\'That could do some serious damage to an adult\'s hand or to the arm of a child.\'\xc2\xa0
He added: \'She has her jesses [a thin leather strap] and bell on and given her size she will be unmistakable.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
\'If she is in a tree top during the day, she will be mobbed by crows. This means they will try and chase her out of the area.
Darren Jackson, who has owned the owl since she was ten days old, warned people not to try and pick her up
\'If she is in a residential area, she is likely to try and rest under a bush she is tired or stressed but in that instance I would recommend people not to pick her up or try to catch her as there is a potential for them to be hurt by her talons if they don\'t know what they are doing.\'
Anyone who may come across the bird is asked to contact the National Parks & Wildlife Service, their local vet or gardai.


A sharp rise in inflation will be most keenly felt in Northern Ireland, retailers have said.
Discretionary weekly income is just over half the UK average, and food prices are at their highest level in more than five years.
Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: \xe2\x80\x9cRetailers are working hard to keep down shop prices; however, cost pressures in the supply chain have built up and are being compounded by increases in government-imposed taxes.
Northern Ireland Retail Consortium director Aodhan Connolly (Rebecca Black/PA)
\xe2\x80\x9cThese pressures are now outweighing the impact of strong competition between shopkeepers, who have little margin to work with, and who are regrettably being forced to pass on some of these costs to consumers.
\xe2\x80\x9cWith Northern Ireland households having half of the discretionary income of households in Britain, this inflation will be felt and most keenly felt by lower income households who typically spend proportionally more of their family budget on groceries.\xe2\x80\x9d
Northern Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s average discretionary weekly income is \xc2\xa3109 but the UK average is \xc2\xa3207 and in London it is \xc2\xa3282.
The latest UK-wide Shop Price Index of the 500 most commonly bought products shows prices at shop tills nudged up again in March, to a six-year high.
Shop price inflation accelerated to 0.9%, up from 0.7% in February \xe2\x80\x93 the highest inflation rate since March 2013, the index showed.
Non-food prices were at the same level as March 2018. In February, they were 0.2% higher than the previous year.
Food inflation accelerated in March to 2.5%, up from 1.6% in February, the highest inflation\xc2\xa0rate since November 2013.
Global commodity prices and weather events pushed food prices up, with an increase in global cereal prices seeing bread and cereal costs rise.
Last year\xe2\x80\x99s bad weather meant several UK crops, like onions,\xc2\xa0potatoes, and cabbage, saw much lower yields, and, as a result, these products are seeing now significant price increases.


BERLIN, April 11 (Reuters) - The German government is expected to halve its economic growth forecast for 2019 to 0.5 percent from 1.0 percent due to weaker exports in the wake of global trade tensions, the news magazine Der Spiegel reported late on Thursday.
It said the new forecast for Europe\'s largest economy, which is to be released next Wednesday, could still change marginally.
The government expects gross domestic product to grow by 1.5 percent in 2020, partly because of positive calendar effects from four public holidays falling on weekends, Spiegel reported.
Germany\'s leading economic institutes last week also revised down their 2019 growth forecast to 0.8 percent from a previous estimate of 1.9 percent.
New data released this week showed that German exports and imports had fallen more than expected in February.
Germany\'s economy is facing headwinds from a slowing world economy, global trade disputes and the threat of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal. Its manufacturing sector is in recession as exporters bear the brunt of weaker demand.
The export-dependent economy has been relying on consumption and state spending for growth, helped by a solid labour market and low interest rates, but last year posted its weakest growth rate in five years.
The weaker growth forecast will inform Germany\'s tax forecast, to be released in May. (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Kevin Liffey)


A baby boy has died after suffering a fall at his home in rural Ireland.
The 15-month-old was pronounced dead shortly after the incident in Clonroche, near New Ross, in County Wexford on Tuesday afternoon.
It is thought the youngster - named as Shea Joyce by local station South East Radio - fell down some stairs.
The 15-month-old was pronounced dead shortly after the incident in Clonroche, near New Ross, in County Wexford on Tuesday afternoon
The toddler was discovered unresponsive at the foot of the staircase in his family home, and despite help from a local doctor died shortly after.
Garda\xc3\xad rushed to the scene but quickly established that the death did not appear to be suspicious.
New Ross Fianna F\xc3\xa1il councillor John Fleming said residents were rallying around the heartbroken parents, who have three older children.
He told The Irish Mirror: \'There is a dark cloud over the whole area.
\'They live in a cul-de-sac there and there\'s a lot of good neighbours, good friends and relations on the road and they\'ll rally around them at this time.
\'It\'s a hugely tragic accident and the whole area is in absolute shock.\'
The councillor added that the family are well-known and liked in the area.
A garda\xc3\xad spokeswoman said: \'Gardai in Wexford are investigating the sudden death of an infant male who was pronounced dead at Wexford Hospital yesterday afternoon after being brought from Clonroche.
\'Gardai are preparing a file for the coroner. The death is not believed to be suspicious. No further details are available.\'


DINARD, France, April 6 (Reuters) - Foreign Ministers of the Group of Seven nations agreed on Saturday to put pressure on those responsible for a violent power struggle in Libya, especially commander Khalifa Haftar, to avoid a military escalation, Germany\'s Heiko Maas said.
"We are agreed that we must use all the possibilities at our disposal to exert pressure on those responsible in Libya especially General Haftar, so that we avoid any further military escalation. We all agreed," he told reporters.
Each country would use its own channels, said Maas, adding that Italy and France had direct contacts with Libya. "The situation is very worrying and we cannot accept a further military escalation," Maas said after a ministerial meeting. (Reporting by Richard Lough; editing by John Irish Via Berlin Newsroom)


Between 1955-56 and 2002-03, there was one meeting of English clubs in the European Cup and Champions League. Nottingham Forest and Liverpool in 1978-79.
Later the format changed, allowing multiple entries from the same competition. On Tuesday, when Tottenham play Manchester City it will be the 12th all Premier League tie in 16 seasons.
As Tottenham are in a new stadium, Manchester City are on for an unprecedented Quadruple and the teams haven\'t met in Europe before, it is still exciting - but give it a few years and the dead hand of Andrea Agnelli and see how you feel.\xc2\xa0
Juventus president Andrea Agnelli and other club owners want to reshape European football
By the time the inheritor of Juventus is finished, the Champions League will be as moribund as \xe2\x80\x94 well, Serie A, or the Bundesliga, or any of the domestic competitions controlled by the men who now presume to reshape European football, having ruined their own.
Juventus are winning their league by 20 points and are on course for an eighth straight title.\xc2\xa0
Meanwhile, the most mediocre Bayern Munich side in recent memory have just beaten their main rivals, Borussia Dortmund, 5-0 to reclaim their place at the top of the league in Germany. Stay there, and it will be their seventh straight win.
Having greedily crushed all opposition, these clubs wonder why their markets are shrinking.
So Agnelli has an idea - and this shows how dim he is. He wants to turn the greatest club competition in the world into the International Champions Cup. He wants to limit surprise, limit the new, limit all of the uncertainty that makes sport compelling.
Juventus are winning their league by 20 points and are on course for an eighth straight title
Who won the International Champions Cup last summer? Who cares? It\'s an invitational, a gathering of the world\'s wealthiest, hawking their wares around the globe under the pretence of competition.\xc2\xa0
In 2016, Manchester United and Manchester City did not even complete their fixture schedules and nothing happened. Why would it?
It doesn\'t matter whether this tournament finishes or not. Everyone comes back next year just the same because entry is for the richest, not the best.\xc2\xa0
AC Milan have featured in every edition since the first in 2013, a period in which the club has finished eighth, 10th, seventh, sixth and sixth.
This is what Agnelli wants for the Champions League. Not excellence, not brilliance: the right to be rubbish. He wants to take qualification away from league position and root it in history.
He wants endless repeats of the same uninspiring fixtures, because he imagines a global audience that knows no better and will lap it up.\xc2\xa0
Most of all, he wants to strip the Premier League of everything that makes it good. He thinks our owners are as stupid as he is; long-term, who knows, he may be right.
Not all invitationals are without worth. The Masters is an invitational \xe2\x80\x94 to win it earns a lifelong invite \xe2\x80\x94 but one that equally acknowledges current form.\xc2\xa0
Agnelli\'s plans would prioritise history for likes of AC Milan \xe2\x80\x93 the past would trump the present
The top 50 in the world are always present, as are those qualifying for the season-end Tour Championship. High finishers in the other major tournaments and leading amateurs are also acknowledged.
Agnelli\'s plans would prioritise history. The past would trump the present, the old would flourish over the new.
Not all of his ideas are ruinous. His proposed format would simply make European competitions duller, not irrelevant.\xc2\xa0
Four groups of eight instead of eight groups of four will involve many more fixtures fans can afford to miss, more dead rubbers and dead ends, but ultimately a recognisable competition should still emerge.
His scheme to link qualification to historic, not current, success however is the end of the Champions League as a prestige competition.\xc2\xa0
Once Leicester can pull off the greatest achievement in the history of English football and it ceases to matter in Europe, the Champions League is dead.
Once an elite club can finish sixth without consequence, the domestic league is done, too. The league must be relevant. Success there must afford entry to Europe. Abandon that principle and the entire campaign is worthless. Why watch, if we know the outcome?
This season\'s Premier League title race is compelling, but so is the fight for two Champions League places between four clubs. Tottenham, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United are separated by a handful of points.
Yet what if we already knew Manchester United and Chelsea were through, due to their status as past winners? Then the drama is dead.\xc2\xa0
If Leicester winning the league ceases to matter in Europe, the Champions League is dead
As is fifth-placed Atalanta\'s battle with the Milan clubs in Italy, and Getafe\'s fairy tale in Spain, and the resurgence of Eintracht Frankfurt in Germany \xe2\x80\x94 a club without a top-four finish in 26 years.\xc2\xa0
At Wembley on Sunday, the supporters of Wolverhampton Wanderers and Watford made for the most inspiring noise the new stadium has heard.
Are we to tell those fans that, soon, there will be a red rope across the door, and only those who were good decades ago will be allowed through.
That is Agnelli\'s intention: the endless recycling of matches between the self-styled elite, mediocre Milan versus average Arsenal, with other, deserving match-ups ignored.\xc2\xa0
The all-English games still carry excitement, but Liverpool have met Chelsea five times in the Champions League since 2005.
If they had played again this year it would not have carried the same excitement \xe2\x80\x94 just as Liverpool against Porto is rather underwhelming given their mismatch a year ago.\xc2\xa0
Imagine then, if it didn\'t even matter who won \xe2\x80\x94 if the same round of fixtures were destined to be rerun, regardless of quality, regardless of competitive balance, regardless of merit.
That is Agnelli\'s proposal. Maybe it comes from inherited wealth. A person feels entitled. To everything.

Walker was stupid \xe2\x80\x93 no butts\xc2\xa0
Anyone who has ever seen or, heaven forbid, felt a headbutt properly delivered will know the difference between that and what Kyle Walker did to Alireza Jahanbakhsh of Brighton at Wembley on Saturday.\xc2\xa0
Walker was aggressive, and certainly foolish given the potential consequences, but there is a butt and there is contact that happens when two men square up.
Anthony Taylor and the VAR call were correct. It was a yellow card and anything more would have been disproportionate given the reality of the offence. We need to stop making needless drama.

I swear, foul-mouthed Costa had to go\xc2\xa0
Referee Gil Manzano has revealed the phrase that got Diego Costa sent off after 28 minutes of Atletico Madrid\'s match with Barcelona. According to the official report, Costa told him: \'I s*** on your whore mother.\'
This reminded of waiting for Mark Dennis in the car park at The Dell after one of his many dismissals for Southampton in the Eighties. On this occasion, it was for dissent.\xc2\xa0
He stopped and we asked exactly what had happened. Dennis recalled a contentious offside going against him.
\'I turned to the ref,\' he explained, \'and I said to him, "You f****** stupid c***, you f****** blind t***".\'
He paused for a moment of reflection. \'Course I had to go, didn\'t I?\' One hopes Costa is blessed with similar insight.

We must come clean about the tragic cost of racing\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0
As the field sped towards the second at Aintree, the death throes of Up For Review could clearly be seen.\xc2\xa0
Brought down at the first, he was thrashing around on the turf in the distance, unable to rise.\xc2\xa0No context was offered in the commentary. No mention beyond the news of a couple of fallers.
On the second circuit, we were told the runners were bypassing the first fence, but not why. It took a small degree of knowledge to notice the bleak green screens in the corner of the picture, and imagine what was unfolding behind them, and no one was about to let the two-quid-each-way viewers in on that horrific detail.\xc2\xa0
When ITV later re-showed the race, the coverage started from the second fence, again without proper explanation.
Yet if national hunt racing is so easily defensible, why the secrecy? Why not tell people what they are seeing? Why sanitise events for the home audience?
It does not matter whether you love the sport, deplore it, or are just feeling increasingly uncomfortable \xe2\x80\x94 there were three equine deaths at the Aintree meeting, and the same number at Cheltenham \xe2\x80\x94 we should at least be honest about consequences.\xc2\xa0Then, unlike tragic Up For Review, we can make up our own minds on participation.

Nikita Parris introduced a welcome dose of realism into what might be termed the Field of Dreams stage of women\'s football in England.
The call for club matches to be moved to huge arenas, despite average attendances of 937 in the Women\'s Super League, belongs very much to the fantasy world of Kevin Costner\'s cornfield baseball diamond bringing forth the ghosts of the 1919 Chicago White Sox baseball team.
\'If you build it, they will come,\' Costner\'s character, Ray Kinsella, is told \xe2\x80\x94 which is a nice line for a film, but doesn\'t help sell out stadiums, when average gates are actually down by 16.9 per cent from two years ago.
Phil Neville was among those encouraging clubs to move women\'s games to their main stadiums, citing the 60,739 that watched a women\'s match between Atletico Madrid and Barcelona recently. Yet more than half the crowd got in free and massive emphasis was placed on promoting a set-piece event.
Atletico Madrid Femenino have played at home to Real Betis at their 3,865 capacity stadium since, and the attendance was 613. Giving away a product free does not translate to increased interest.
Parris, who plays for Manchester City, seems alone in advocating organic growth. \'Let\'s build women\'s football from the bottom before we get to the top,\' she said.\xc2\xa0\'We can talk about the Etihad and Manchester United\'s ground in a few years\' time. Let\'s fill the academy Stadiums and the Kingsmeadows, first of all.\'
Kingsmeadow is where Chelsea Women play. It has a capacity of 4,850 and the most recent match, against West Ham, drew a crowd of 2,854 \xe2\x80\x94 very good for a WSL game and better than the average attendance at five League Two clubs, but roughly 39,000 under what Stamford Bridge holds.
So what purpose is served taking Chelsea Women to an echoing, empty bowl? They might get a spike for a one-off outing, but beyond that?
It could be ruinous for a sport that is working hard to build a core audience. That is where the future for women\'s football lies: not in the fantasy of novelties and gimmicks.

Tottenham have not beaten Manchester City since leaving White Hart Lane. So, if they win on Tuesday, it will say something for the power of the new arena.\xc2\xa0
\'Everybody talks about the stadium like it\'s special,\' sniffed Kevin De Bruyne. \'Everybody has a stadium. The stadium doesn\'t matter.\'
It mattered at this stage of the competition last year, mind you, when City seemed to freeze faced with the challenge of Anfield on a European night.\xc2\xa0
Might 17,500 fans in the impressive Park Lane end similarly embolden Tottenham? Certainly, this is a greater test of home advantage than last week\'s victory over unambitious Crystal Palace.
Tottenham are playing a team that are their superiors by 16 points over 32 games this season. If they can turn that form around, it would suggest there is inspiration in their new home.\xc2\xa0
If they cannot, perhaps De Bruyne is right and having the best stadium won\'t matter until the best team also plays there.
If Tottenham beat Man City on Tuesday,\xc2\xa0it will say something for the power of the new arena

Gordon Strachan was known for his acerbic quips. Some were funny, but they were also easy. Reporters tie themselves in knots trying to be polite after matches. Instead of asking the brutal \'why did you lose?\' an interviewer will try to couch it in gentler terms: \'In what areas were the opposition better than you today?\'
Strachan\'s sarcastic response to that one: \'Mainly the big green one out there\' is amusing, but unenlightening.\xc2\xa0
\'You don\'t take losing lightly, do you?\' said one hapless questioner after a defeat, affecting sympathy. Strachan\'s reply \xe2\x80\x94 \'I don\'t take stupid questions lightly, either\' \xe2\x80\x94 made no acknowledgement of this.
Yes, it was a stupid question, but would he prefer the blunt version? Managers don\'t seem to like that, either. Anyway, as Strachan now knows, there is a difference between a one-liner and the weighty analysis the modern game demands.
Sports discussion programmes are like the Andrew Marr show. Sexism, racism, executive pay, gambling, the rehabilitation of offenders, brain injuries, employee welfare, divisions in society, high finance, complex international law, the moral maze \xe2\x80\x94 be prepared to discuss it all, and without verbal missteps.\xc2\xa0Strachan thought the folks with the microphones had it easy. Now he knows.

ROME, April 1 (Reuters) - Italy\'s finances will deteriorate this year and next, with debt and the budget deficit both rising because of recession and higher public spending, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said on Monday.
In a special report on Italy, the Paris-based OECD said the deficit would rise to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product this year, above the 2 percent target Rome agreed in December with the European Commission.
The economy will shrink by 0.2 percent this year, the OECD said, confirming a forecast last month, before expanding 0.5 percent in 2020.
Political uncertainty and high borrowing costs will offset the expansionary policies adopted by the coalition government of the 5-Star Movement and the League, it warned.
Most other forecasters expect Italy\'s economy to stagnate this year rather than shrink. The government still officially forecasts 1 percent growth, although it\'s expected to lower that in a new planning document later this month.
"Italy continues to suffer from long-standing social and economic problems," the OECD said, citing issues ranging from low employment and rising poverty to gaping regional disparities and stagnant productivity.
Italy\'s inflation-adjusted, per capita GDP is lower than in the year 2000, it said, making it unique among the OECD\'s 36 member countries.
In a bleak 153-page report http://www.oecd.org/economy/surveys/italy-economic-snapshot, the think-tank forecast unemployment would rise from 10.6 percent in 2018 to 12.0 percent this year.
"The dearth of job opportunities pushes many young people to emigrate, exacerbating Italy\'s already fast population ageing and depriving the country of energy, talent and entrepreneurship," it said.
The budget deficit will rise to 3.0 percent of GDP in 2020, the OECD said, assuming the government does not adopt increases in sales tax included in its latest fiscal plan.
Italy\'s public debt, proportionally the highest in the euro zone after Greece\'s, will hit a record 133.8 percent of GDP this year and climb to 134.8 percent in 2020, the OECD said.
The government targets a decline in debt from 132.1 percent in 2018 to 130.7 percent this year and 129.2 percent in 2020.
Rome\'s 2019 budget "rightly aims to help the poor," the OECD said, but it warned that the "citizens\' income" welfare benefit would require marked improvements in job-search and training programmes to help people find jobs.
The budget\'s other flagship measure, a reduction in the retirement age, will lower economic growth in the medium term and risks worsening inter-generational inequality and increasing the public debt, the OECD said.


Sport Ireland has confirmed it has suspended funding to the Football Association of Ireland amid concerns over a controversial loan.
Last week, Sport Ireland chief executive John Treacy told an Oireachtas committee his organisation had no knowledge of a \'bridging loan\' made to the FAI by former chief executive John Delaney of 100,000 euro (\xc2\xa387,000) or that the FAI was paying Delaney\'s rent.
Delaney - who officially resigned from the FAI board following on from quitting as chief executive - confirmed last month he gave the association the loan to help it through a short-term cash flow problem, which has since been repaid.
It was a way of protesting against at chief executive John Delaney\'s continued role in the FAI
Sport Ireland, which provides 2.7 million euro (\xc2\xa32.3m) a year for a number of programmes within the FAI, confirmed the decision, also referencing future financial support, in a statement on Tuesday afternoon.
The statement read: \'The Board of Sport Ireland at its meeting today (April 9th) has decided to suspend and withhold future funding to the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) in accordance with Clause 1.1 of Sport Ireland\'s Terms and Conditions of Grant Approval.
\'The decision was taken in light of an acknowledgment by the FAI in its written opening statement to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport tomorrow that in 2017 the FAI did not comply with Clause 4.3 of Sport Ireland\'s Terms & Conditions of Grant Approval.\'
Ireland fans expressed their anger at Delaney\'s role in the ongoing controversy
The statement added: \'In making the decision to suspend and withhold funding, the Board of Sport Ireland notes that the FAI has already been paid 50 percent of its 2019 funding to date and some positive steps taken by the FAI in recent days.
\'This decision will be reviewed by the Board of Sport Ireland as a standing item at each of its future meetings.\'
Sport Ireland said the reinstatement of funding would be considered once the FAI have completed ongoing reports and adopted recommendations but only if \'all necessary processes and controls are in place\' to secure the governing body\'s continued compliance.
The statement further added that Sport Ireland \'will continue to provide non-financial assistance and guidance to the FAI, which may be helpful in advancing matters\'.


Ireland\'s quest to win a first World Cup has suffered a major setback after Dan Leavy was ruled out of the tournament by a knee injury described by Leinster as \'complex\'.
Leavy lasted only 11 minutes of Saturday\'s Champions Cup quarter-final victory over Ulster before he was carried from the pitch on a stretcher having replaced Sean O\'Brien in the second-half.
The 24-year-old openside had just recovered from the long-term calf injury that forced him to miss the recent Six Nations in which Ireland surrendered their crown to Wales.
Ireland have been dealt a major blow after Dan Leavy was ruled out of this year\'s World Cup
Not only will Leavy be absent for the climax to Leinster\'s bid to defend their European title, he will also sit out Japan 2019 to rehabilitate an injury that will require long-term medical attention.
\'Leinster can confirm that Dan Leavy had an initial scan yesterday on a complex knee ligament injury but needs further assessment this week,\' his province announced.
\'He has been ruled out for the remainder of the season and into next season to include the World Cup.\'
Leavy was superb throughout last year\'s Six Nations as Ireland completed the Grand Slam, but has struggled with injury in the wake of the subsequent summer tour to Australia.
\'Dan worked so hard to get himself back and physically fit,\' Leinster scrum coach John Fogarty said.
\'He\'s such a huge threat on either side of the ball, gives the team a lot confidence so it\'s a big loss for Leinster and Irish rugby. He\'ll make a plan now to get himself back.\'


What to watch in the leading soccer leagues in Europe this weekend:
ITALY
Cristiano Ronaldo is likely to win his first trophy with Juventus this weekend.
Juventus needs just a point at relegation-threatened Spal on Saturday to secure a record-extending eighth straight Italian league title.
It is 20 points clear of second-place Napoli and has a better head-to-head record, which is the tiebreaker in Italy.
Juventus would become the first Italian club to clinch the title with six matches to spare. The previous record of five matches was set by Torino in 1947-48 and matched by Fiorentina in 1955-56 and Inter Milan in 2006-07.

AC Milan hosts Lazio on Saturday in a match crucial to both teams\' ambitions of qualifying for the Champions League.
Milan is in the fourth and final qualifying position but is above Atalanta based on its superior head-to-head record.
Roma is a point further back, while Lazio is three points below Milan but has played one less game.

FRANCE
Paris Saint-Germain gets a second chance to wrap up the French league title.
The defending champions travel to second-place Lille on Sunday with a 20-point lead over its opponent. A win for PSG will to clinch a sixth title in seven years with seven games to spare.
PSG was widely expected to beat Strasbourg on Sunday at the Parc des Princes but instead dropped its first points at home this season in a 2-2 draw.
With Neymar and Edinson Cavani still injured, PSG coach Thomas Tuchel is expected to put forward Kylian Mbappe back in the team.
Third-place Lyon will hope for a PSG win so the fight for the second automatic Champions League qualifying place can be rekindled. Lyon can reduce its five-point deficit to Lille by winning at Nantes on Friday.

ENGLAND
Chelsea\'s trip to title-chasing Liverpool in the Premier League revives memories of the same fixture at Anfield five years ago, when the home team\'s aspirations of becoming English champion were damaged irreparably.
In 2014, Liverpool hosted Chelsea knowing a win would have put the team six points clear with two games remaining. A first league title since 1990 was in its grasp.
But after a slip from Steven Gerrard that led to Chelsea\'s first goal, Liverpool lost 2-0 and finished two points behind Manchester City.
Once again, it is City challenging Liverpool for the title. And once again, City will hope Chelsea can pull off a victory at Anfield.
City, which plays Crystal Palace hours before the Liverpool-Chelsea game on Sunday, is two points behind Liverpool but has a game in hand. The defending champion, City has a tougher run-in that includes games against Tottenham and Manchester United.

SPAIN
Barcelona gets something of a break this weekend as it closes in on the Spanish league title.
After defeating Atletico Madrid last weekend to open up an 11-point lead, and then beating Manchester United in the Champions League on Tuesday, Barca travels to last-place Huesca on Saturday in La Liga.
Barca coach Ernesto Valverde is expected to rest many of the team\'s starters following the two big matches.
While Barcelona is unbeaten in 17 matches in all competitions and hasn\'t been defeated in the league since November, Huesca has lost 17 of its 31 league matches so far and won only one of its last eight games.
Playing in the first division for the first time, Huesca was routed 8-2 by Barcelona in the teams\' first meeting. It is six points from safety with seven matches remaining.
Atletico Madrid, trying to hold on to second place, hosts Celta Vigo, which is attempting to escape relegation, on Saturday. Third-place Real Madrid, which is two points behind its city rival, visits Leganes on Monday.

GERMANY
Bayern Munich heads into a match against Fortuna Duesseldorf with a one-point lead over Borussia Dortmund in the German league with six rounds remaining.
Bayern and Dortmund have exchanged the lead five times this season, and Bayern is the latest to be in front after a 5-0 win over Dortmund last weekend.
But Fortuna could provide Bayern with a stern test on Sunday after having virtually assured Bundesliga survival with a 2-1 win at Hertha Berlin last weekend. It has claimed 28 points from its last 14 games and only three other teams have done better.
Dortmund hosts Mainz on Saturday, with coach Lucien Favre saying he will try to "relax the team so they rediscover the fun in football."

MILAN (AP) - Italy\'s hard-line vice premier is meeting with like-minded leaders of European right-wing party as he seeks to form a broad alliance ahead of the European elections next month.
Matteo Salvini of the the anti-migrant League says that the coalition that he is forming with Marine Le Pen, leader of France\'s far-right National Rally, "will be a great event for Europe for the next 30 years."
Salvini is meeting Monday in Milan with leaders of the Danish People\'s Party, The Finns Party and Alternative for Germany.
Peter Kofod Poulsen, the Danish People\'s Party\'s top candidate for the European Parliament elections, said in a statement that the parties are looking to form a new group of parties with common interests after the European-wide elections next month.

DUBLIN, April 9 (Reuters) - Ireland\'s state-funded sport coordination body suspended future funding to the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) on Tuesday after the soccer body acknowledged that it failed to comply with its grant approval terms.
Sport Ireland, which has been demanding answers from the FAI over a 100,000 euro ($112,770) short-term loan provided to it by former chief executive John Delaney, said the acknowledgement was made in a written statement the FAI was due to deliver to a parliamentary committee on Wednesday.
Delaney, who was moved to a new role of executive vice-president at the FAI shortly after details of the loan were first reported, is due to appear before the committee with other officials on Wednesday to answer questions over a story that has made frontpage news in Ireland in the last month.
In the FAI\'s statement to the committee, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, chairman Donal Conway said circumstances arose in April 2017 -- when it received the loan -- that were not related to Sport Ireland in line with grant approval conditions.
The FAI said last month that the loan was needed due to short-term cash flow issues and that it was repaid in full two months later.
Sport Ireland, however, said it was never notified about any deterioration in finances, as the FAI would have been obliged to do.
"The Board of Sport Ireland will consider the reinstatement of funding once all ongoing reports commissioned by the FAI have been completed and the recommendations adopted," it said in a statement, referring to reviews the FAI has commissioned from audit firm Mazars and accountant Grant Thornton.
The FAI, which generated a retained surplus of 2.8 million euros on revenues of 49 million in 2017, its last set of published reports, receives annual funding of 2.7 million euros from the state. It has already drawn down half of it for 2019.
The FAI said it was unfortunate Sport Ireland felt compelled to suspend the funding, which was crucial to the development of Irish soccer.
"The Association is keen to restore trust and confidence and rebuild the relationship with Sport Ireland as soon as possible," FAI chairman Conway said in a statement.
Lawmakers due to quiz the FAI on Wednesday welcomed the suspension and said they would also seek answers about the decision to move Delaney to another position in the association.
"It\'s a damning indictment that such shoddy financial and corporate governance practices were permitted. Hopefully this is the start of a real change," Noel Rock, a member of the governing Fine Gael party, said on Twitter.

Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd, pictured above in a court in Georgia, is appealing against his conviction over the death of Charlotte Brown
Speedboat\xc2\xa0killer Jack Shepherd has vowed to pursue his \xe2\x80\x98human rights\xe2\x80\x99 at Europe\xe2\x80\x99s top court to clear his name.
He is appealing against his conviction over the death of Charlotte Brown \xe2\x80\x93 whom he still blames for the tragedy.\xc2\xa0
But if British courts reject his bid for freedom, he plans to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights \xe2\x80\x93 which has the power to rule his trial was unfair.\xc2\xa0
Yesterday a source close to his legal team in Georgia, where he fled last year, said: \xe2\x80\x98He will pursue every avenue to clear his name. Jack knows his rights...
\xe2\x80\x98He will take it to the European Court of Human Rights if he can. But he is quietly confident his first appeal will succeed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0
Shepherd, 31, was last July convicted at the Old Bailey in his absence for the manslaughter of Miss Brown, 24, who died when his speedboat flipped on the Thames on a drunken first date in 2015.
His legal aid-funded appeal is based on perceived legal errors made by the judge in relation to his police interview.
Miss Brown, 24, died when his speedboat flipped on the Thames on a drunken first date in 2015.\xc2\xa0He has issued a reluctant apology to Miss Brown\xe2\x80\x99s parents, but shamelessly continues to blame her for her own death
If it fails, he could ask the Strasbourg court to uphold his \xe2\x80\x98human right to a fair trial\xe2\x80\x99, claiming he was unable to defend himself properly at the Old Bailey \xe2\x80\x93 even though this is because he had absconded.
The Strasbourg court has nothing to do with the European Union and Britain will remain under its jurisdiction after Brexit.
Shepherd, a web designer who spent ten months living incognito in Georgia before a Daily Mail investigation tracked him down, is due to be extradited to the UK tomorrow to start his six-year jail sentence. He is expected to face an Old Bailey judge on Thursday.
He has issued a reluctant apology to Miss Brown\xe2\x80\x99s parents, but shamelessly continues to blame her for her own death. He claims she was driving his defective speedboat when it hit a floating log.
He said from his cell in the Georgian capital Tbilisi: \xe2\x80\x98Her actions led to the fatal accident.\xe2\x80\x99
At his trial, prosecutors said that, if it was true, he was even more culpable for her death because as captain he should have known that Miss Brown, a business consultant from Clacton, Essex, had no experience with boats.
If British courts reject his bid for freedom, he plans to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights \xe2\x80\x93 which has the power to rule his trial was unfair
Shepherd said: \xe2\x80\x98Ultimately, it was her action to accelerate in the manner that she did, even though I failed to prevent her. You see, it\xe2\x80\x99s shared [responsibility].\xe2\x80\x99
He added: \xe2\x80\x98There are matters of luck and fate \xe2\x80\x93 an unseen log in the path of the boat. In the end I survived while Charlotte lost her life. Things could have been very different.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0
He admitted \xe2\x80\x98some of the moral responsibility for Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s death\xe2\x80\x99 and said he understood why her family blamed him.
Referring to Miss Brown\xe2\x80\x99s parents, Graham Brown and Roz Wickens, he said: \xe2\x80\x98Absolutely, unreservedly, I apologise for the role I played. But the reality is not quite so simple. I am very sorry for what happened. It was a tragedy and if I could do anything to change what happened I really would.\xe2\x80\x99
Asked if he regretted fleeing before his trial, he said: \xe2\x80\x98Primarily, yes. The consequences for me and others, the way I\xe2\x80\x99m perceived, it\xe2\x80\x99s upset a lot of people and it was against my own interests also ... But also, the choice I felt I faced ...was between running and suicide.\xe2\x80\x99
Miss Brown\xe2\x80\x99s mother said: \xe2\x80\x98Nothing he says will bring my daughter back.\xe2\x80\x99


The former deputy speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly is to stand in the European elections if they take place in Northern Ireland.
Jane Morrice, the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Coalition founder and peacemaking expert, said it was her duty to speak out against the \xe2\x80\x9charmful\xe2\x80\x9d effects of the UK\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal from the EU.
The UK has begun making preparations to hold a poll next month, but will cancel the elections if Brexit happens before then.
Ms Morrice said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the elections to the European Parliament give me the opportunity to find ways to reduce the harm of Brexit on Northern Ireland, I must stand up and be counted.\xe2\x80\x9d
She describes herself as a \xe2\x80\x9cdedicated and devoted European\xe2\x80\x9d, and would enter the race as an independent candidate.
She added: \xe2\x80\x9cBrexit is bad for Northern Ireland.
The former deputy speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly Jane Morrice (European Economic and Social Committee/PA)
\xe2\x80\x9cIt threatens the political, economic and social fabric of our society and could serve to halt, even reverse, our hard-won peace process.
\xe2\x80\x9cAs an elected member of the European Parliament, standing as an independent, I will do everything in my power to ensure that does not happen.\xe2\x80\x9d
She was one of the architects of the first multimillion-pound EU Peace Programme in Northern Ireland, in her role as head of the European Commission office in Belfast.
She has campaigned to keep EU funding for peace in Northern Ireland.
Ms Morrice added: \xe2\x80\x9cWith increasing calls for independence in Scotland and a border poll in Ireland, Brexit is not only bad for economic, social and political progress in Northern Ireland.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt also threatens the break up of the United Kingdom.
\xe2\x80\x9cThose who back Brexit must recognise this risk and find ways to reduce its negative impact by supporting my proposal to keep Northern Ireland in the EU as part of the UK \xe2\x80\x93 and putting the new deal to the people, with an option for the UK to remain.\xe2\x80\x9d
After the Brexit referendum, she launched a petition calling for Northern Ireland to be given honorary EU association as a European place of global peace-building.
It has attracted 6,500 signatures.
She backed calls for a second referendum.
She said any deal \xe2\x80\x9cmust contain a safety net for Northern Ireland which will secure our economic progress and prosperity by giving us the best of both worlds and, above all, protect our precious peace process\xe2\x80\x9d.
She said her track record in politics, working within the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Coalition on the fringes of the Good Friday Agreement negotiations and as deputy speaker of the first Stormont Assembly, was proof of her determination to make Northern Ireland a better place for everyone.


JOHANNESBURG (AP) - The migration of Africans to Europe and North America should be viewed as a positive phenomenon, not a threat, Sudan-born billionaire Mo Ibrahim said Sunday.
Experts said at a weekend conference hosted by Ibrahim\'s foundation in Abidjan, Ivory Coast that Africans make up about 14% of the global migrant population, a much smaller share than the 41% from Asia and 23% from Europe.
"Migration is healthy. It\'s not a disease," Ibrahim told The Associated Press in an interview. "Migration is about aspirations, not desperation. People who migrate are mostly capable, ambitious young people who are migrating to work and to build successful lives. They add wealth to the countries they go to."
Ibrahim also cited statistics to rebut anti-migration politicians who say Africans have inundated Europe.
"Europe is not being flooded by Africans," Ibrahim said, citing statistics that show 70% of African migrants relocate within Africa.
The 72-year-old philanthropist earned his fortune by establishing the Celtel mobile phone network across Africa.

Now living in Britain, he says African countries should have better education and employment opportunities for their young.
"Farming should be sexy. It should be seen as profitable and productive, not a backward thing," said Ibrahim. "Yes, IT and technology are important, but agriculture is a way of the future for Africa."
Ibrahim\'s foundation publishes an annual index and awards a leadership prize to encourage good governance in Africa.


More than 400 people gathered on cliffs near Brighton to send an SOS signal across the English Channel in protest against Brexit.
The protesters used mirrors and other reflective objects to send the signal in the direction of continental Europe.
The stunt was a \xe2\x80\x9clarge scale, pro-EU, human artwork\xe2\x80\x9d, according to a statement issued by the organiser, Bristol-based artist Dunkan McKellar.
The stunt was a "symbolic" protest over Brexit, according to the organiser. (duncanmckellarsunshine on Instagram/PA)
\xe2\x80\x9cThe group successfully created a symbolic SOS call to the rest of Europe, to show the strength of the British pro-EU community in the face of Brexit chaos,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement added.
The protest took place on Saturday on the cliffs at Saltdean on the south coast.
The crowd spread out to form a long line along the coast, facing out across the sea.

LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - Britain\'s Brexit minister said he could not rule out the possibility of the country taking part in next month\'s elections for the European Parliament, despite the damage that could inflict on the British political system.
"To have European parliamentary elections three years after the country voted to leave would be damaging to our politics as a whole," Stephen Barclay told parliament on Thursday.
But such a prospect could not be ruled out, he said.
"If we are a member of the European Union, then under treaty law we will be required to have European parliamentary elections," Barclay said.
Prime Minister Theresa May has said she does not want Britain to take part in the elections but that might happen if she has to extend Brexit beyond its latest scheduled date of April 12.

The Irish Government has been urged to launch legacy investigations into Troubles killings that took place in its jurisdiction.
Northern Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s Victims Commissioner Judith Thompson made her first presentation on legacy proposals at Leinster House on Thursday.
Among her recommendations was for Ireland to establish a mechanism similar to the proposed Historical Investigations Unit in Northern Ireland to carry out investigations into incidents that took place in the Irish Republic.

She also urged that legislation allowing effective information sharing for legacy inquests is established, and that transparent processes and a robust appeals system are in place around national security to help build trust with families.
A number of incidents related to Northern Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s troubled past took place in the Irish Republic.
These include the killing of 34 people on May 17 1974 after the Ulster Volunteer Force planted a series of bombs in Dublin and Monaghan and\xc2\xa0the IRA\xe2\x80\x99s murder of Lord Mountbatten and three others in Sligo in 1979.

On Thursday, Ms Thompson made a presentation to the Oireachtas committee on the Good Friday Agreement, and urged they use their influence to press the Irish Government on the matter.
She told the committee that there was a sense of isolation and inequality felt by victims who live outside Northern Ireland.
\xe2\x80\x9cI believe there is a good understanding of the issues, I believe there is a sense of it being very difficult to move on,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms Thompson told the committee.
\xe2\x80\x9cI need to be more reassured that both governments feel that this is something that is not only important but urgent and doable.\xe2\x80\x9d

There have been proposals to establish a Historical Investigations Unit as well as an Independent Commission on Information Retrieval and an Oral History Archive.
Ms Thompson said she does not believe many convictions will be secured, but said having investigations is important for bereaved families.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe purpose of historical investigations should not be defined narrowly in terms of numbers of prosecutions,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.
\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not really primarily in the end what these investigations need to deliver, it is evident from previous and ongoing investigations, new information and evidence can be uncovered and that families who want answers can be better served than they have been, even if the evidence, as is likely in many cases, is insufficient to secure a conviction.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe critical issue for many families and communities as well is access to information about the circumstances leading to the death of people they love, and acknowledgement of the harm that has been done to them.\xe2\x80\x9d
Independent TD Maureen O\xe2\x80\x99Sullivan, who\xc2\xa0chairs Justice for the Forgotten which represents survivors and families of the victims of the May 1974 blasts, commended Ms Thompson.
\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you are saying is so true to their story, their experience and what they have been looking for, they have been waiting 46 years now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.
The issue of the definition of a victim, which has sparked rows over whether perpetrators should be included, was raised by\xc2\xa0Fermanagh MP Michelle Gildernew.
During her contribution, the Sinn Fein MP revealed she was diagnosed with PTSD in 2013 \xe2\x80\x9cas a result of the conflict\xe2\x80\x9d.
Ms Gildernew said while the Dublin and Monaghan bombings \xe2\x80\x9cunderstandably get a lot of attention\xe2\x80\x9d, she said there were also bomb attacks in Cavan.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe pain of those families is the exact same of Jonathan Parry\xe2\x80\x99s, anybody who has lost a loved one knows what it feels like to be a victim,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.
\xe2\x80\x9cTo that end is there any progress on the definition of a victim\xe2\x80\x9d.
Ms Thompson responded: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a definition in law which is the one I operate under which is an inclusive definition.
\xe2\x80\x9cI understand why that is difficult for some people and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is a perfect definition, however I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a perfect definition would look like and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think a conversation about who should be excluded from consideration of their pain is a healthy one to have as a way of dealing with the past.\xe2\x80\x9d


Brian O\xe2\x80\x99Driscoll fears Johnny Sexton\xe2\x80\x99s injury woes could be enough to derail Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup hopes in Japan this year.
The fly-half has not appeared for Leinster since the turn of the year, and was ruled out of last Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s Champions Cup quarter-final victory over Ulster with a quad issue.
He played in each Guinness 6 Nations clash for Joe Schmidt\xe2\x80\x99s side, but was forced off with a concussion following a heavy hit during their victory over Scotland at Murrayfield, an occupational hazard given the No 10\xe2\x80\x99s uncompromising style.
Johnny Sexton will miss his tenth Leinster game of the year when they play on Saturday night
And while there are other options, his former team-mate for club and country insists any hopes of lifting the Webb Ellis trophy in November are entwined with the fitness of the current World Player of the Year.
\xe2\x80\x98I think of course there\xe2\x80\x99s a worry,\xe2\x80\x99 said O\xe2\x80\x99Driscoll when asked about Sexton\xe2\x80\x99s domestic lay-off. \xe2\x80\x98You want your best player, or one of your best players, on the park whenever you can.
\xe2\x80\x98He definitely got targeted against Scotland and I felt as though all of the collisions were right on the line. But I think it would\xe2\x80\x99ve been hard to penalise any of those shots.
\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the way that Johnny plays the game. Of course you would worry a small bit about the aggressive nature he takes the ball with but that\xe2\x80\x99s his selflessness in creating space for others out wide.
\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a contingency with Joey Carbery in there, trying to give game time to the likes of Jack Carty as well, but if Ireland are to win the World Cup you do sense that they need Johnny Sexton.\xe2\x80\x99
Sexton played with O\'Driscoll, and his former team-mate fears for Ireland\'s hopes in Japan
O\'Driscoll praised the playing style of his former club-mate, but says his absence is worrying
Sexton will once again be absent on Saturday as Leinster entertain Benetton at The RDS, making it a total of 10 missed club outings in 2019.
At 33, he is approaching the business end of his career at the highest level and any attempt to prolong his time at the top is understandable.\xc2\xa0
O\'Driscoll, who is currently at the Cathay Pacific/HSBC Hong Kong Sevens, knows that alterations can be important to extending playing days.
HSBC have been trying to promote rugby throughout Hong Kong, trying to get schools to incorporate the sport into their curriculum, and BOD spent some of his Friday playing tag rugby as part of the scheme.
It was a reminder of why he had to alter his game late in his career and how the muscle fatigue catches up quicker. But he insists Sexton need not worry about doing the same.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
\xe2\x80\x98I had to modify my game but that\xe2\x80\x99s because the zip went in my legs,\xe2\x80\x99 said O\xe2\x80\x99Driscoll during the latest leg of the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series.
O\'Driscoll is an ambassador for the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series and is out in Hong Kong
\xe2\x80\x98At 10, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be out in the open field as much. If he has lost a half-yard, his brain thinks quicker than nearly everybody else and he\xe2\x80\x99s able to still pick the passes.
\xe2\x80\x98Providing he can still take those collisions on the advantage line and get up and shake them off I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll see Johnny Sexton back at his best.
\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a dream to play outside because he creates space for others and he does so by taking hits where other 10s would stay away from the line and self-preserve themselves a little bit.
\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s not Johnny\xe2\x80\x99s mentality and that\xe2\x80\x99s not his game plan. That\xe2\x80\x99s what makes him so great.\xe2\x80\x99
The No 10 concerns are not the only problems facing Ireland.
Leinster\xe2\x80\x99s Champions Cup success last Saturday came at a heavy price with Dan Leavy suffering a knee injury that has ruled him out of this Autumn\xe2\x80\x99s tournament.
\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a huge loss,\xe2\x80\x99 added the 40-year-old. \xe2\x80\x98To be brutally honest we\xe2\x80\x99ve struggled in the No 7 jersey.
\xe2\x80\x98Sean O\xe2\x80\x99Brien hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to refind the form that we saw a couple of years ago on the Lions tour.
\xe2\x80\x98I think we\xe2\x80\x99re lucky that we have an assembly of good quality back-rowers, but I really feel for Dan Leavy.\xe2\x80\x99
It was a sour note on what was a largely positive return for Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s stars to domestic action after a disappointing Six Nations campaign.
The 40-year-old also believes that the injury to Dan Leavy is a huge blow for Joe Schmidt\'s side
And O\xe2\x80\x99Driscoll insists the change of scenery will have done wonders for Schmidt\xe2\x80\x99s squad.
\xe2\x80\x98I would think they would have enjoyed going back to their provinces and even just getting away from the goldfish bowl that is the Ireland camp \xe2\x80\x93 particularly when it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go great,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.
\xe2\x80\x98The Six Nations will have been parked from their perspective and they\xe2\x80\x99ll pick it up again after their summer holidays.
\xe2\x80\x98Remember too, yes they were beaten well by Wales and quite well by England but they still did get bonus points against France and Italy and beat Scotland. So it\xe2\x80\x99s not all doom and gloom.
\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t labour these things and stride them around with you because it serves no purpose. You need to just be able to park them and look forward with excitement. Particularly when you have two other tournaments still to vie for.\xe2\x80\x99
Those two tournaments, the Pro14 and Champions Cup, still hold interest for at least two provinces. But only just.
Neither Leinster nor Munster were convincing as they booked their semi-final spots in Europe\xe2\x80\x99s premier competition, and O\xe2\x80\x99Driscoll, who lifted the trophy three times, thinks the likelihood of an Irish showdown in Newcastle is slim at best.
\xe2\x80\x98I personally don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99ll happen,\xe2\x80\x99 he admitted. \xe2\x80\x98It could absolutely be a Saracens v Toulouse final because of the quality.
Munster came through their Champions Cup quarter-final against Edinburgh last Saturday
Leinster squeezed through against Irish rivals Ulster and now face Toulouse in the semi-finals
\xe2\x80\x98I do feel as though Leinster will be able to edge it in the semi-final but I also fancy that Saracens will just have too much for Munster.
\xe2\x80\x98They just have a great squad, a very clear way of how they want to play the game.
\xe2\x80\x98They have very experienced players, some real strike runners and good finishers. So, for me, Sarries are still the team to beat.\xe2\x80\x99
Back in Hong Kong, it is the Fijians who O\'Driscoll is backing.
\'They have a special love for the Hong Kong sevens,\' he said of the Fiji supporters, some of whom have made the journey of over 5,000 miles to watch their country.
\'Their looking for five tournaments in a row and you\xe2\x80\x99d be a foolish man to bet against it.\'

She has moved to Italy for a year with her husband Peter Lewis and four children.
And although radio host Kate Langbroek has been enjoying the good life since relocating, she revealed Peter had a far more gruesome experience after falling from his bike this week.\xc2\xa0
Taking to Instagram on Wednesday, the HIT radio host, 53, shared a photo of his severely grazed upper thigh where the skin had been left raw.
Ouch! Kate Langbroek has revealed her husband\'s horrific injury obtained during her family\'s \'gap year\' in Italy after he came off his bike and stripped the skin off his thigh\xc2\xa0
\'My husband came off his bicycle,\' Kate told her followers.
In the photo, her spouse is wearing just his boxer shorts and the full scale of the injury is clear - with the skin appearing to have been torn off in two directions.
His shins didn\'t escape unscathed either, with a number of bloody scratches visible in the photograph.
The graphic injury drew sympathy with the radio host\'s celebrity friends, including The Project host Carrie Bickmore.\xc2\xa0
Peter\'s unfortunate accident isn\'t the only mishap to befall him since moving to Europe.
Kate revealed Peter surprised her with tickets to her favourite comedian, Bill Burr, who was performing in nearby Amsterdam.\xc2\xa0
However, as Kate told listeners on\xc2\xa0Hughesy & Kate last month, Peter got more than he bargained for when he bought two overpriced tickets for 440 euros (AU$706) each.
Uh-oh! Peter\'s (pictured with Kate) unfortunate accident isn\'t the only mishap to befall him since moving to Europe. He was also ripped off when he bought tickets to a show on\xc2\xa0Viagogo\xc2\xa0
Recalling the story to her co-host Dave Hughes, Kate explained that her husband had purchased the tickets through online ticket reselling site, Viagogo.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Kate, Peter and their children Lewis, 15, Sunday, 13, Artie, 12, and Jannie, nine, have been enjoying the Italian city of Bologna since moving from Melbourne in January.
Just days prior to relocating overseas, Kate appeared on The Project to admit she had \'no idea\' why she was doing it.
Jetsetters: Kate, Peter and their children Lewis, 15, Sunday, 13, Artie, 12, and Jannie, nine have been enjoying the Italian city of Bologna since moving from Melbourne in January\xc2\xa0
Kate confessed: \'I can\'t tell you why because I\'ve got NFI [no f**king idea].\'
She added: \'But at the time it seemed like a good idea that we would take our four children and go to live in Italy for a year.
\'Why? I don\'t know. I\'m hanging by a thread.\'

By Francesco Guarascio
BUCHAREST, April 5 (Reuters) - The Italian government and the European Commission have reached a provisional agreement to reimburse some investors who bought shares in failed banks, an Italian official said, in an unprecedented move that would soften EU rules on bank rescues.
The bail-in rules devised after the last decade\'s financial crisis were designed to make any given bank and its creditors - instead of taxpayers - financially responsible if it went bust, with shareholders first in line to pay up.
Since the regulations came into force in 2016, shareholders have been all but wiped out in all bank collapses, including Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and two smaller north-eastern banks that Italian authorities intervened to save in 2017.
Losses have also been inflicted on bondholders in some cases, while depositors have always been spared.
But under the new provisional deal between Brussels and Rome, bondholders and shareholders of failed Italian banks could claim their money back, the official from the Italian finance ministry said.
"The Commission is in constructive contact with Italy on the proposed measures," the EU commissioner for financial services Valdis Dombrovskis said, declining to comment further.
Under the agreement, shareholders with annual incomes below 35,000 euros ($39,280) and property worth less than 100,000 euros would be automatically compensated for their losses in past bank rescues, the official said.
The deal would notably benefit Italian savers forced to buy bank shares in exchange for mortgages in what appears to have been fraudulent transactions, but its critics say it is unlikely that all those entitled to claim compensation under the wealth criterion were victims of swindling.
In a March ruling that has been interpreted as a softening of the bail-in rules, EU judges overturned a decision the European Commission took in 2014 to block the rescue of Tercas, a small Italian bank, with money from the country\'s depositor fund.
While Brussels could appeal that ruling, the deal with Italy would further weaken the legal framework.
The agreement would need to be approved by the two parties in Italy\'s eurosceptic government, which is campaigning for EU elections in May.
The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement wants even softer terms to compensate those who were allegedly missold bank shares and bonds, an Italian official said. It and the co-ruling far-right League pressed for generous compensation for bank creditors before last year\'s national elections in Italy.

DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) - China\'s prime minister promised Friday that his government will respect European standards and fair trade, seeking to allay concerns that it is flouting European Union competition rules with huge investments on the continent.
Opening an annual summit between Eastern and Central European nations and China, Li Keqiang said "we intend to fully respect European standards."
The Chinese government has also been criticized for failing to give reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
"We welcome openness and we want to treat all companies that operate in China equally and to increase imports from the (European) countries," he said. "China is open to the world...we welcome the two-way openness."
EU member Croatia is hosting a two-day summit between China and 16 regional countries on expanding business between China and the region, dubbed 16+1.
Several Eastern European countries are part of China\'s ambitious "Belt and Road" investment and construction project that aims to create a gateway to western European markets. The project includes upgrading infrastructure to create a network of transport and trade links between Asia and Europe.

Beijing has created a $3-billion fund and announced a $10-billion credit line for the 16 countries in the region.
At the start of the plenary meeting, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said that over a relatively short time, the initiative "has resulted in the establishment of new ties and projects" also becoming a platform for "intense and substantial political dialogue" between the participating states.
He also announced that Greece will join the coalition. The vision is to have the Chinese-controlled Greek port of Piraeus become an entry point for Chinese goods to Europe by linking it to railroads and highways that are also part of China\'s investments.

Sinn Fein is ready to fight European elections in Northern Ireland, its party president has said.
Mary Lou McDonald and other senior party leadership figures discussed the prospect of a poll north of the border at a meeting of the Sinn Fein ruling council in Dublin on Saturday.
\xe2\x80\x9cIf an election happens, we will fight the election. We are ready,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.
\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the uncertainties is around the whole issue of elections in the north, whether or not there will be European elections.
Speaking to media in Dublin with @MaryLouMcDonald After a week of more Brexit chaos, the status quo of uncertainly remains. We will travel to London on Monday for a series of meetings including meeting with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.

\xe2\x80\x9cWe will be ensuring that we will be prepared, and above all this is about protecting Irish interests.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt never ceases to shock me the extent to which our nearest neighbours can disregard the effects of their actions or inactions on all of us who live in this island.\xe2\x80\x9d

Sinn Fein has one outgoing MEP representing Northern Ireland, and three representing the Irish Republic.
The party is already campaigning south of the border ahead of May\xe2\x80\x99s European poll.
Mrs McDonald said a no-deal Brexit remains a \xe2\x80\x9creal and live possibility\xe2\x80\x9d.
She said the democratic mandate of people in Northern Ireland to remain in the EU must be acknowledged.
The Sinn Fein president said commitments made by the UK and EU to protect the Good Friday Agreement and ensure no hardening of the border also have to be honoured.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe look across the water with some despair at the chaos in Westminster,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.


Ireland captain Rory Best has eased fears over his participation at the World Cup after revealing he should recover from his ankle problem before the end of the season.
Best suffered the damage to his left foot in Ulster\'s Champions Cup quarter-final defeat by Leinster on Saturday and following a scan on Monday it was confirmed he will be fit to lead Joe Schmidt\'s team into Japan 2019.
\'Probably the scan couldn\'t have been a lot better. There\'s no structural damage, just a few wrenches to some of the ligaments in there,\' Best told reporters.
Ireland captain Rory Best has eased fears over his participation at the World Cup
\'So, from that side of things, it\'s good news. It is still going to be a few weeks. They just like to put the magical figure of six weeks on it.
\'It might be less, it might be more, but it\'s in and around there. I would hope to play some part in the end of season for Ulster, which will be a big goal now.
\'Obviously that will depend on the next three games, certainly the next two games for us in terms of play-offs.\'
Best has accumulated 117 caps and has been Ireland\'s first-choice hooker since making his debut in 2015.
The 36-year-old\'s fitness will come as a relief to Schmidt after the Kiwi head coach was told on Monday that Leinster openside Dan Leavy would miss the World Cup because of a \'complex\' knee injury.

A Lithuanian man enjoyed airborne bliss as he boarded a hulking Boeing 737 to find he was the only passenger.\xc2\xa0
Skirmantas Strimaitis, who was flying from Vilnius in Lithuania to Bergamo in Italy for a skiing holiday on March 16, had the whole 188-seater plane to himself.
No screaming infants or selfish seat recliners to contend with on his two hour flight, but just the\xc2\xa0two pilots and five cabin crew to take care of his every need.
Skirmantas Strimaitis takes a selfie onboard a Boeing 737-800 airplane, taking off from Vilnius, Lithuania on March 16, as the only passenger aboard
The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold.
But only one lucky passenger had bought one.
Mr Strimaitis said on Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was \'a once in the lifetime experience.\'
He shared selfies from his flight where he was seen beaming from ear-to-ear as he settled in to enjoy the spacious, peaceful ride.\xc2\xa0
In July last year, 28-year-old\xc2\xa0Saad Jilani was able to experience similar luxury when he was the only passenger aboard a flight from Corfu, Greece, to Birmingham, England.
He praised the Jet2Airways staff as \'amazing\' and said they were \'very excited\' to give him the rare experience as he returned from a friend\'s wedding in Greece.
Mr Jilani said it was the best flight of his life and it ended with the pilot announcing: \'The eagle has landed.\'\xc2\xa0

Latsamy McAdoo from the States found herself similarly lucky in January last year when hopping to an island in Thailand.
She was shocked to see a member of the cabin crew closing the doors when she had only just boarded the A319 jet.
Like Mr Jilani and Mr Strimatis she could sit back and relax with space all around her to settle into her flight\xc2\xa0from Bangkok to the island of Koh Samui.


British passports without the words European Union on the front cover have been issued despite the Brexit delay.
The burgundy passports were introduced from March 30, the day after Britain was expected to leave the EU.
Some passports including the words European Union will continue to be issued while the remaining stock is used up.
But those applying for a new travel document will not be able to choose between the two.
Susan Hindle Barone, who picked up her new passport on Friday, said on Twitter she was \xe2\x80\x9ctruly appalled\xe2\x80\x9d.

\xe2\x80\x9cI was just surprised \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99re still members of the EU,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 she told the Press Association.
Photo from the twitter feed of SpinHBarone of her new passport (left) and her old passport (right) (@SpinHBarone/Twitter/PA)
\xe2\x80\x9cI was surprised they\xe2\x80\x99ve made the change when we haven\xe2\x80\x99t left, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a tangible mark of something which I believe to be completely futile.
\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we gain by leaving? There\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a whole lot we lose.\xe2\x80\x9d
She added: \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s face it, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the changes to the passport \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s just symbolic.
\xe2\x80\x9cWhat really matters are the potential changes to our country \xe2\x80\x93 the damage to the economy, our communities and our international standing.\xe2\x80\x9d
The decision to remove the words was made in anticipation of Britain leaving the EU at the end of last month.
Dark blue passports are scheduled to be issued from the end of this year.
A Home Office spokeswoman said: \xe2\x80\x9cBurgundy passports that no longer include the words European Union on the front cover were introduced from 30 March 2019.
\xe2\x80\x9cIn order to use leftover stock and achieve best value to the taxpayer, passports that include the words European Union will continue to be issued for a short period after this date.
\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be no difference for British citizens whether they are using a passport that includes the words European Union, or a passport that does not. Both designs will be equally valid for travel.\xe2\x80\x9d


BERLIN (AP) - Pharma and chemicals giant Bayer says it is cutting 4,500 jobs in its home market of Germany.
Bayer said Tuesday that the positions are part of 12,000 job cuts around announced last year. The company currently has about 32,100 employees in Germany.
Bayer is fighting the fallout from lawsuits over the alleged carcinogenic effects of Roundup, a weed killer it acquired with the purchase of American agrochemicals rival Monsanto. Bayer says that scientific evidence shows the product is safe and regulators have supported that conclusion.


Aboriginal elder Gudju Gudju Fourmile (C) of the Yidinji people received the skeletal remains at Munich\'s Five Continents museum
A German museum handed over the remains of an Aboriginal ancestral king to Australia Tuesday in the first of three such ceremonies across Germany this month in what Canberra called a record return.
The Australian ambassador to Germany, Lynette Wood, and elder Gudju Gudju Fourmile of the Yidinji people received the skeletal remains at Munich\'s Five Continents museum. They had been in German possession since 1889.
Skulls and bones from Australia\'s native peoples were removed by scientists in the late 19th and early 20th century and taken to museums, universities and collections in Australia and around the world.
There they were subjected to "research" purporting to explain human biological variety.
In a statement, Australia\'s Minister for Communications and the Arts Mitch Fifield welcomed the planned repatriation of a total of 53 Australian indigenous remains from Germany in April, saying it would be "the largest number of ancestors returned from Germany to date".
A further ceremony is planned at Stuttgart\'s Linden Museum on Friday for the repatriation of eight Aborigine remains.
"These ancestors will be returned to Australia under Australian government stewardship, so they can be cared for closer to home while further work is undertaken to identify their communities of origin," Fifield said.
On Monday in Berlin, 37 ancestors\' remains from the Saxony state ethnographic collections as well as five ancestors from Martin Luther University will be returned to Yawuru community representatives and the Australian government.
"The Government would like to thank the German state governments and the collecting institutions for their commitment to recognising the significance of repatriation for all Australians, which contributes to healing and reconciliation," Fifield said.
Bavaria\'s arts and sciences minister Bernd Sibler, who attended Tuesday\'s event, said the state was committed to a "transparent approach to collections from the colonial era", in coordination with indigenous representatives.
Australia\'s Department of Communication and the Arts said it had supported the "unconditional" return of more than 1,500 Australian indigenous ancestral remains from overseas and private collections for more than 30 years.
It said it was in talks with 35 institutions across 10 countries on the return of further ancestral remains.
Germany has until now returned 51 human remains to Australia.
The native Aboriginal population, who have occupied Australia for 50,000 years, were dispossessed of their lands by the arrival of settlers two centuries ago.
As the colonisers pushed into the vast interior of the island continent, they were resisted by the local population and thousands of men, women and children were killed.

The low-cost tickets do not include any checked baggage or in-flight food, which can be purchased for an additional cost.
Another pitfall to the cheap flights is the potential for a long stopover in Singapore.
Jet setters flying out of Melbourne face a lengthy 22-hour layover should they book the flights, but for customers willing to put up with the wait the tickets provide the perfect opportunity to travel on a shoestring.\xc2\xa0
Scoot is also offering cheap business class tickets to Athens, starting at just $989.\xc2\xa0
Economy tickets from Australia to Athens often cost upwards of $1300.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0

Europe\'s domestic leagues, concerned about plans to drastically overhaul football on the continent from 2024, say they will not allow UEFA club competitions to be played at weekends.
The topic, alongside the revenue distribution model for the Champions League and Europa League, is set to dominate discussions when the European Leagues umbrella organisation holds a general assembly in Lisbon on Friday.
UEFA has recently begun discussions with the continent\'s clubs over the format for European competitions from 2024.
The European Leagues umbrella organisation holds a general assembly in Lisbon on Friday
The European Club Association (ECA) has said it wants more teams playing more games in European competition although, after meeting in Amsterdam last week, added that it was too early to give details on what was being planned.
However, the European Leagues are concerned that European soccer\'s governing body UEFA could ultimately give captive places to some bigger clubs and play matches at weekends.
\'We will always protect our weekends. We will not allow European club competition to be played at weekends,\' said European Leagues Deputy General Secretary Alberto Colombo.
\'The passion of football fans is driven by local football and by their tradition to go to the stadium with family and friends on Saturday and Sunday.\'
The\xc2\xa0European Club Association, led by Andrea Agnelli (left), will propose new formats
Colombo added that under the current model the clubs earned places in UEFA club competition by finishing at the top of their respective leagues.
\'If you give the big clubs guaranteed places in UEFA Club Competition and you destroy this model, it will devalue domestic football which drives the passion of fans,\' he said.
European club football runs in three-year cycles with the current one ending in 2021.
The format for the 2021-24 cycle was decided last year with the addition of a new third-tier competition in addition to the Champions League and the Europa League.
However, revenue distribution for the 2021-24 cycle has not been settled and European Leagues are arguing for a greater share of the spoils to be given to the clubs who do not qualify for European competition.
It wants so-called solidarity payments to be increased from the current 7.3 percent to 20 percent in the next cycle.
In a recent statement, the Leagues said it was \'imperative to increase solidarity so as to safeguard the dream of all clubs, and not just a few rich ones, to perform in a fair competitive environment.\' (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)

BERLIN (AP) - Germany\'s health minister on Monday launched a drive to tackle a shortage of donor organs with a reform that would make most people potential organ donors unless they object.
At present, doctors in Germany can transplant organs only from people who actively declare their willingness, for example by carrying a donor card or making a living will. Around 2,000 people in the country of 80 million die each year while waiting for transplants.
Under the new system proposed Monday by Health Minister Jens Spahn and a cross-party group of supporters, people would automatically be considered as donors unless they opt out by putting themselves on a register saying they object - which they could do at any time.
Relatives could also tell officials that the deceased made clear they didn\'t want to donate. Everyone aged 16 and over would be informed repeatedly of the new system, while there would be no donations by people who aren\'t in a position to grasp the significance of the decision, for example because of mental disability.
Spahn said 20 out of 28 European Union countries have similar systems and "everything we have tried so far hasn\'t led to a rise in donor figures."
"We still have about 10 times more people on the waiting list for an organ than the number that are transplanted," said Karl Lauterbach, a health policy expert with the center-left Social Democrats. Last year, there were some 9,400 people on the waiting list and well under 1,000 transplants, while about 2,000 people on the waiting list die each year, he said.
Germany\'s parliament is expected eventually to hold a free vote on new rules.
Another cross-party group of lawmakers is calling for people to be regularly asked about their intentions and an online register of donors. The group says it wants to ensure that organ donation remains "a conscious and voluntary decision that cannot be forced by the state."


Phil Neville wants to see clubs like Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea \'throw open\' their stadiums for women\'s matches.
The England Women boss feels that with free tickets for such games huge crowds could attend, and has declared: \'Let\'s blow away the rest of Europe.\'
On March 17 there was a crowd of 60,739 at the Wanda Metropolitano for Atletico Madrid against Barcelona, a world record attendance for a women\'s club match.
Atletico\'s game in January against Athletic Bilbao at San Mames had a crowd of 48,121, and on March 24 there were 39,000 present at the Allianz Stadium as Juventus Women took on Fiorentina.
A crowd of 2,800 watched\xc2\xa0Chelsea beat West Ham in the Women\'s Super League on Sunday
But Neville, whose side face Canada at Manchester City\'s Academy Stadium on Friday in the first of four home \'Road to France Series\' warm-up matches ahead of this summer\'s World Cup, said: \'Looking at the attendances in our league yesterday, I actually think that\'s better than the one-off games in Spain or Italy.
\'There was 2,800 at Kingsmeadow (where Chelsea beat West Ham in the Women\'s Super League), 1,500 at Solihull (where Birmingham lost to Arsenal). I think we\'ve got a good foundation.
\'I see games in Spain where there\'s probably only 100 to 150 people watching. So I think as a base line, we\'ve got probably a little bit more sustainability.
\'What I would say is that some of the big teams in England now have got to open their big stadiums and fill it, and let\'s say \'let\'s blow the rest of Europe away\' because I think our game in this country is at a far better place than what it is in Spain and Italy.
Phil Neville wants clubs like Manchester United to \'throw open\' their stadiums for matches
\'I think now, if (second-tier leaders) Man United win the league, or (top-flight leaders) Arsenal - throw open your stadium, open it up.
\'Champions League game for Chelsea - why not play it at Stamford Bridge? Get 30 or 40,000.
\'I think my players are at the level now where our big clubs have got to open their stadiums and let\'s fill it and let\'s blow away the rest of Europe.
\'That\'s my feeling having watched Bilbao, Juventus. They\'ve done it, but let\'s us do it maybe two or three times from now to the end of the season.\'
Neville was then asked if he would advocate following those overseas games by having free tickets, and said: \'Why not?
Neville\'s England\xc2\xa0face Canada at Manchester City\'s Academy Stadium on Friday night
\'Man United let people in for free when they play at Leigh, so why can\'t you at Old Trafford? Why can\'t we fill Stamford Bridge for a Champions League semi-final against Lyon? It would be incredible.\'
Chelsea Women\'s Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris St Germain at the Stade Jean Bouin had an attendance of over 13,000 and flares were thrown from the stands during the contest.
Ahead of the first leg at Kingsmeadow a coach containing about 50 PSG supporters was turned away from the ground after weapons, fireworks and drugs were found.
Neville said: \'When I went to the Chelsea home game against PSG, even the little bit of kerfuffle before it showed me the women\'s game is going places.
\'I know it wasn\'t a nice thing, but you know, that little thing - \'actually this is important now\'.
\'The atmosphere in Paris where they\'re throwing things on the pitch, it\'s not nice and I don\'t like it but actually it shows we\'re catching people up.
\'We don\'t want any of the rubbish but what I\'m saying is it is a sign people aren\'t turning up for a women\'s game now just to sample the chips and bring the kids, they\'re actually coming because they want their team to win badly.
\'On Friday when we\'ve got 8-9,000 at Man City and 15,000 at Swindon (England face Spain at the County Ground next Tuesday), that will be something probably 70 per cent of my squad haven\'t played in front of and that\'s why I\'m excited about these games.\'

DUBLIN, April 2 (Reuters) - Ireland will not countenance checks on its exports at EU ports following any no-deal Brexit as a result of its plan to keep an open border with Northern Ireland, Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Tuesday.
Ireland\'s 500 km (350 mile) border with British-governed Northern Ireland will be the UK\'s only land frontier after Brexit. The question of how to retain seamless cross-border trade has been a major hurdle in efforts to ensure the UK quits the bloc in an orderly fashion.
That becomes an even more difficult task in a no-deal Brexit as Dublin has also pledged to maintain the integrity of the EU\'s single market, where goods move freely around the bloc without the need for checks. The bulk of Irish exports to the continental EU are shipped via the UK.
"We have to find a way of ensuring that we protect the single market\'s integrity and that we avoid physical infrastructure on the (Irish) border," Coveney told parliament ahead of meetings between Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and the leaders of France and Germany this week.
"Ireland is not going to allow a situation where the UK leaving the EU without a deal drags Ireland out of the single market with it. What I mean by that is checks in EU ports on all Irish products, that is not a runner and would cause significant damage to our economy so we will not allow it."
"COMPLEX CHALLENGE"
EU sources told Reuters in February that Dublin would soon have to come up with a plan to ensure the integrity of the single market or face checks on its own goods coming into the rest of the bloc, if they are also allowed to move freely to and from a country that is no longer a member.
"That is something that we do not have an agreed plan on but we are working this week and presumably next week on, if we need to, in the context of a no-deal Brexit," Coveney said, referring to meetings with the EU Commission he said had begun last week.
"That is a complex challenge and we always said it would be. And we always said also that it would involve difficult conversations with the European Commission and they are happening now."
The EU warned on Tuesday that Britain could be heading for a potentially disorderly no-deal exit in just 10 days time as Prime Minister Theresa May met with ministers to thrash out ways to break the deadlock. The UK parliament has three times rejected her divorce deal with the EU.
Ireland has for months refused to even countenance contingency plans along its border with Northern Ireland in a no-deal Brexit, saying there would have to be "very difficult conversations" over how it would be managed if Britain leaves without a deal.
Britain and Ireland fear the installation of physical customs infrastructure on the border could reignite largely dormant sectarian tensions and prove a tempting target for militants seeking a united Ireland. (Reporting by Graham Fahy and Padraic Halpin; Editing by Gareth Jones)


BERLIN, April 8 (Reuters) - German exports and imports both fell more than expected in February, data showed on Monday, in the latest sign that Europe\'s largest economy is likely to post meagre growth in the first quarter amid increased headwinds from abroad.
German exporters are suffering from a slowing world economy, trade disputes and Brexit angst. Leading economic institutes last week slashed their forecast for 2019 growth and warned a long-term upswing had come to an end.
The Federal Statistics Office said seasonally adjusted exports were down by 1.3 percent on the month, the biggest drop in 12 months, while imports fell 1.6 percent.
The trade surplus edged up to 18.7 billion euros ($20.99 billion) from a revised 18.6 billion euros the previous month.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 0.5 percent decrease in exports and a 0.7 percent decline in imports. The trade surplus was expected to narrow to 18.0 billion euros.
"There simply seem to be too many crises in global trade for the German export sector to defy all of them at the same time," Carsten Brzeski from ING said.
He pointed to the trade dispute between the United States and China, growing fears of a no-deal Brexit, a possible cooling of the Chinese economy and problems in other emerging markets.
Data released last weak showed German industrial orders fell by the biggest margin in more than two years in February. However, industrial output rose slightly more than expected in the same month as mild weather helped a surge in construction.
Germany is in its 10th year of economic expansion, but narrowly skirted a recession at the end of last year and posted its weakest growth rate in five years in 2018.
The German government will update its growth forecast later this month. In January, Berlin said it expected the economy to grow by 1.0 percent this year.

April 10 (Reuters) - WarnerMedia Chief Executive John Stankey denied a report on Wednesday that parent company AT&T was considering selling its HBO Europe business, calling it "baseless and inaccurate."
The Financial Times report, citing current and former senior executives, said AT&T had internally discussed selling HBO Europe as part of efforts to reduce a debt pile of $170 billion.
"We normally do not comment on speculation, but when a news outlet is advised that their reporting is factually incorrect and report it anyway, we feel compelled to set the record straight," Stankey, who heads the newly created unit of AT&T, said in a statement.
"There is no truth whatsoever to the Financial Times\' story saying AT&T is or has considered selling HBO Europe. It\'s completely baseless and inaccurate. HBO Europe is a valuable asset for our growth plans in Europe."
The paper said that HBO Europe was one of several assets AT&T had considered selling but that it had not held formal talks with any potential buyers.
In November, AT&T said it had committed to cutting its heavy debt load in 2019 through a variety of measures, including a review of all of its non-core assets such as its stake in streaming video company Hulu for possible sale.

The boss of a cupcake company has had to pre-purchase a ten week supply of soft cheese from Germany to store in a UK warehouse in case Brexit slows deliveries.
Asher Budwig, managing director of Lola\'s Cupcakes, says the company identified soft cheese as one of the ingredients whose supply might be affected by Brexit disruption as it is imported from Germany.
He told the BBC that his firm analysed possible stress factors for the business arising from Brexit and concluded soft cheese, which ordinarily arrives via just-in-time deliveries from the Continent, might be at risk.
\'If\xc2\xa0ferries can\xe2\x80\x99t come through the port, I mean the factory will literally grind to a halt,\' he said.
The boss of Lola\'s Cupcakes (cakes pictured above) ordered some ingredients in advance
Asher Budwig (pictured), managing director of Lola\'s Cupcakes, says the company identified soft cheese as one of the ingredients whose supply might be affected by Brexit disruption as it is imported from Germany
\xe2\x80\x98No cheesecakes, no decorations on cupcakes, you know that\xe2\x80\x99s a massive issue for us and our customers and all the team actually that work here, there\xe2\x80\x99s over two hundred people that work here.\'
Mr Budwig reached out to the UK importer from whom he buys the cheese, and the importer asked the factory for a larger order in order to ensure supplies.
He said: \'They spoke to the factory in Germany, they produced a lot more - ten times what we would usually go through in a given week - got that all over here to the UK.
\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s being held down in Somerset for us, in a huge chilled distribution facility and then we just call it off as and when we need to, whatever we need we\xe2\x80\x99re asking for.\'
He said that in the current \'political environment\' the firm was now asking itself "what\'s the next steps?", adding \'we only purchased ten tonnes\'.\xc2\xa0
It comes as figures revealed the British economy received a boost last month from other companies placing similar larger orders.\xc2\xa0

New statistics reveal Britain\'s gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.3 per cent in the period between December and February compared with the previous quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
In February, the UK economy grew by 0.2% versus January\'s 0.5% print.
Both measures were ahead of economists\' expectations, who had pencilled in zero growth for February and 0.2% for the three-month period.
At that time there were strong fears and warnings that Britain might leave the economic bloc on March 29 without a deal.
This potentially could have led to chaos at the UK border, with badly hit imports and exports, and a shortage of raw materials.
Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, said: \'GDP growth remained modest in the latest three months. Services again drove the economy, with a continued strong performance in IT.
\'Manufacturing also continued to recover after weakness at the end of last year with the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry, chemicals and alcohol performing well in recent months.\'
The ONS cited data that showed a surge in manufacturing output in March was linked to manufacturers and firms hoarding goods in the run-up to what was supposed to be Brexit.
Companies stepped up production to build inventories in advance of March 29, Britain\'s original Brexit day, before the Conservative Government asked the EU for an extension.


BERLIN (AP) - Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.

Dubrovnik, lately famous for being a \'Game of Thrones\' location, is the backdrop for Chinese efforts to woo eastern Europeans
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang will meet leaders from eastern and central Europe in Croatia on Friday to talk business, fresh from a key summit with EU where he pledged opening up his country\'s economy.
The coastal city of Dubrovnik is hosting the eighth annual "16+1 cooperation" -- an economic platform for Beijing\'s investments in 11 eastern European Union states and five Western Balkan countries.
The grouping has been eyed cautiously in western European capitals as an attempt to "divide and rule" the bloc, a goal Li has denied.
In an article published in Croatian dailies ahead of the gathering, the Chinese premier tried to paint the summit in a cheery light:
"When we put 17 multicolour countries together we get a colour richer than a rainbow," he wrote in the article titled "Multicolour countries, spacious future".
"If we build a rainbow bridge through Asia and Europe, we will achieve a nice future cooperation."
China\'s record on follow-through with investment promises is mixed
Eastern Europe is a core component of Beijing\'s vast "Belt and Road" project, valued at up to $1 trillion and aimed at constructing land and sea links to allow Chinese exports to flow westward.
China has previously announced a $10 billion credit line and $3 billion investment fund for the 16-country region.
So far its record on follow-through is mixed, with some major construction projects under way while other promised investments have been delayed or scrapped.
For instance, building on one of 16+1\'s flag-ship projects -- a railway from Belgrade to Budapest -- has just started in Serbia but is held up by snags in Hungary, ultimately making scant progress five years after it was announced.
- \'Pilot project\' -
This year\'s summit comes just three days after a top EU-China meeting, attended by Li, held as Brussels demands more balanced economic ties with a country it recently labelled as a "systemic rival".
In Brussels on Tuesday the Asian giant pledged to push further to open its economy and deepen ties with the bloc.
EU Council president Donald Tusk hailed Beijing\'s new commitments as a "breakthrough" with both sides committed to globalisation and pursuing international rules.
Brussels and Beijing in a document called for "broader and more facilitated, non-discriminatory market access," in wording the Europeans saw as a Chinese concession.
The EU is increasingly unhappy that markets in Europe are wide open to Chinese companies, while the equivalent is not the case in China.
While the EU\'s 15-trillion-euro ($16.9 trillion) market gives it significant economic clout, the bloc struggles to maintain unity among its 28 members on issues of foreign policy, allowing China to pursue one-on-one deals with individual countries.
EU leaders liked the bit about \'non-discriminatory market access\'
Some EU powers, such as France and Germany, are growing increasingly concerned with China\'s Belt and Road ambitions, especially after populist-led Italy recently became the first G7 member to join the scheme.
In 2018, China was the second largest destination for European exports.
The Chinese trade balance is largely in surplus with the bloc at 184 billion euros, according to Brussels figures.
During the first visit of a Chinese premier to Croatia, Li on Thursday visited the site where a Chinese firm started construction on a 280-million-euro bridge on the Adriatic coast.
It is the first significant Chinese project in Croatia and funded by the EU.
"This bridge is a pilot project for both \'16+1 cooperation\' and cooperation between China and EU," Li said while visiting the bridge\'s site on Thursday.
About 1,000 businessmen including some 400 Chinese will participate at a business forum held alongside the summit in Dubrovnik.


BERLIN (AP) - Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s Cabinet has approved extending Germany\'s military missions in Africa for another year.
The dpa news agency reported Wednesday that that includes German troops taking part in a European Union training mission in Mali known as EUTM, and the United Nations "Minusma" peacekeeping force there.
Dpa reports the Cabinet also plans to extend Germany\'s commitment to the EU\'s anti-piracy mission Atalanta that operates off the Horn of Africa, but to reduce its maximum troop numbers from 600 to 400. There are currently 80 troops taking part.
Germany currently has some 180 troops involved in the EUTM mission, with a maximum of 350. A further 900 are in Mali and Niger as part of the Minusma force, with a maximum of 1,100.
Those troop commitments are to remain unchanged.


A giant deer-eating owl that could crush a child with its claws is on the loose in Ireland after escaping from its pen.\xc2\xa0
Locals are being warned not to go near the Eurasian eagle owl which vanished from its home in Kildare after being startled by a cat.
The powerful owl, called Tank, has a 6.5ft wingspan and feeds on deer, rodents and other birds.\xc2\xa0
Owner Darren Jackson has warned people to stay away from his Eurasian eagle owl which escaped from his home in Kildare
The powerful owl, called Tank, has a 6.5ft wingspan and feeds on deer, rodents and other birds. It could easily crush a child with its sharp claws
Darren Jackson, who has owned the owl since she was ten days old, said on social media: \'She may pose a threat to people or children if someone went to pick her up.\xc2\xa0
\'Each of her claws would have a tonne per point. She has four claws, so that\'s four tonnes of pressure.
\'That could do some serious damage to an adult\'s hand or to the arm of a child.\'\xc2\xa0
He added: \'She has her jesses [a thin leather strap] and bell on and given her size she will be unmistakable.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
\'If she is in a tree top during the day, she will be mobbed by crows. This means they will try and chase her out of the area.
Darren Jackson, who has owned the owl since she was ten days old, warned people not to try and pick her up
\'If she is in a residential area, she is likely to try and rest under a bush she is tired or stressed but in that instance I would recommend people not to pick her up or try to catch her as there is a potential for them to be hurt by her talons if they don\'t know what they are doing.\'
Anyone who may come across the bird is asked to contact the National Parks & Wildlife Service, their local vet or gardai.

MILAN, April 1 (Reuters) - Italian energy company Sorgenia is contacting investors to gauge interest for its power generation and retail client assets that could be worth more than 600 million euros ($674 million), three sources close to the matter said.
Sorgenia adviser Lazard has sent out information memoranda to a series of prospective bidders including energy companies, private equity players and energy majors that could use their own gas to feed the business\'s power fleet, the sources said.
Czech energy groups EPH and Sev.en Energy will have a look at the assets, as could private equity firm CVC, the sources said. Italy\'s biggest regional utility A2A has already said it is interested.
"The sale process has just started even though there doesn\xc2\xb4t seem to be a long list of companies interested," one of the sources said.
EPH declined to comment, while CVC and Sev.en were not immediately available for a comment.
Sorgenia CEO Gianfilippo Mancini told Reuters the company was considering bringing new investors on board as one of the options to help it develop its new business plan focused on renewable energy and digital solutions.
"Between April and May the information gathered will be evaluated by the company and shareholders with a view to pursuing this option or staying as we are," he said.
Sorgenia, once controlled by Italy\'s De Benedetti family, is owned by a series of Italian banks, including top lenders UniCredit, Intesa Sanpaolo and Banco BPM , which took over after a debt restructuring.
One of the sources said the banks were ready to sell their stakes, but not at any price.
Sorgenia, which manages a power and gas portfolio of about 275,000 clients, has four gas-fired power plants with a capacity of 3,200 megawatts that in recent years have felt the impact of falling demand and increasing use of green energy.
While no decision has yet been made on how to structure the potential asset sale, one source said it could have an equity value 4-5 times core earnings which in 2017 were 161 million euros.
Sorgenia, which had a debt pile of 1.7 billion euros in 2015 when restructuring began, had net debt of 715 million euros in 2017.

TRIPOLI/ROME, April 11 (Reuters) - Fighting between eastern Libyan forces and Tripoli government troops killed 56 people and forced 6,000 to flee their homes in the capital in the last week, the United Nations said on Thursday, as France and Italy wrangled over how to respond to the renewed conflict.
After sweeping up from the south, the Libyan National Army (LNA) forces of Khalifa Haftar have been blocked in the southern suburbs of Tripoli about 11 km (7 miles) from the center.
Overnight, a Reuters reporter in downtown Tripoli heard gunfire and explosions as the LNA faced off with the forces of Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj\'s government around the former international airport and the Ain Zara district.
Haftar\'s push for Tripoli is the latest in a cycle of violence and chaos in Libya since the 2011 overthrow of former strongman Muammar Gaddafi.
In Rome, Libya\'s former colonial ruler Italy warned France, which has close ties to Haftar, to refrain from supporting any faction after diplomats said Paris blocked a European Union statement calling on him to halt his offensive.
"It would be very serious if France for economic or commercial reasons had blocked an EU initiative to bring peace to Libya and would support a party that is combatting," Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini told Radio RTL 102.5.
"As minister of the interior I will not stand by and watch."
France, which has oil assets in eastern Libya, has provided military assistance in past years to Haftar in his eastern stronghold, Libyan and French officials say. It was also a leading player in the war to unseat Gaddafi..
Italy supports the U.N.-backed government of Serraj.
ITALY SPARS WITH FRANCE
Salvini said France had recently withdrawn its ambassador from Rome "for much less" after leaders of his League party\'s coalition partners, the 5-Star Star Movement, had met with French "yellow vest" protesters.
"Some think that the (2011 Nato-led military intervention) in Libya promoted by (former French President Nicolas) Sarkozy was triggered more by economic and commercial interests than by humanitarian concerns," he said.
"I hope we are not seeing the same film all over again."
An EU draft statement on Wednesday said Haftar\'s attack on Tripoli put civilians at risk, disrupted the political process, and risked an escalation with serious consequences for Libya and the wider region. The statement was blocked by France .
French diplomatic sources said on Thursday Paris did not object to calls on Haftar to stop his advance, but had only requested amendments including mentions of migrants\' plight and the presence among anti-Haftar fighters of militants designated as terrorists by the United Nations.
The latest tally of casualties from the U.N. World Health Organization (WHO) said 56 people - mainly fighters though also some civilians including two doctors and an ambulance driver - had been killed, and another 266 wounded in Tripoli.
The number of people forced out of their homes doubled in the last 48 hours to 6,000, U.N. humanitarian agency OCHA said.
As well as the humanitarian consequences, renewed conflict in Libya threatens to disrupt oil supplies, increase migration across the Mediterranean to Europe, scupper the U.N. peace plan, and encourage Islamist militants to exploit the chaos. Libya is a main transit point for migrants who have poured into Europe in recent years, organized by illegal traffickig gangs.
The LNA forces moved out of their stronghold in eastern Libya to take the sparsely-populated but oil-rich south earlier this year, before heading a week ago towards Tripoli, where the internationally-recognized government of Serraj sits.

It\'s that time of the season when a select few teams defy the laws of physics. As spring unfolds, they develop the ability to be in two places at once.\xc2\xa0
The explanation for Napoli\'s inability to beat 10-man guests Genoa was that they were \'already in London\', thinking about their upcoming Europa League tie with Arsenal.\xc2\xa0
It was a similar situation for the Premier League side who flopped on Merseyside, with their minds supposedly back in Islington for Thursday\'s first leg.
Napoli arrive in London in stuttering form - the Europa League is now a major objective\xc2\xa0
It was 30 years ago that a Diego Maradona inspired Napoli to UEFA Cup glory\xc2\xa0
Carlo Ancelotti needs to use all his guise to steer the Italians past Arsenal in the tournament
All talk in the bay of Naples is of the quarter-final between Carlo Ancelotti\'s outfit and Unai Emery\'s fifth-placed side. The scudetto race may have fizzled out in January, but UEFA\'s secondary tournament provides the southern Italians with an objective.
Napoli won this trophy exactly 30 years ago, when Diego Maradona and his men defeated Germans Stuttgart in a two-legged final. But that is a rare success story on foreign turf. Napoli have got a mental block in continental football, and need every drop of Ancelotti\'s experience to get past the north Londoners.
On several occasions the Azzurri have appeared on the verge of a great achievement against a more powerful side with superior resources, before collapsing under pressure, exhaustion, or a lack of self-belief. When they face a team with the wealth (or ego) of a true Champions League contender, it rarely ends well.
In 1988, their first appearance in the European Cup, Maradona and Co went out meekly to Real Madrid 3-1 on aggregate in the first round. More recently, in 2012, they toppled Chelsea 3-1 in the round of 16 first leg.\xc2\xa0
The city went mad, but a few weeks later at Stamford Bridge, the Blues turned the tie around 4-1, to go through in extra-time and eventually win the cup.
Two years ago it was Zinedine Zidane\'s Real who shrugged off going a goal down in the first leg in Spain to send Napoli out 6-2 over both ties.\xc2\xa0
When Lorenzo Insigne scored a brilliant goal after eight minutes at the Bernabeu against the holders, the impossible seemed possible. Napoli, dressed from head to toe in black, looked mean and ready cause an upset. But it wasn\'t to be.
Napoli arrive in England bidding to mark their famous UEFA Cup triumph 30 years on
Napoli dropped into the Europa League after finishing third in their Champions League group\xc2\xa0
This season Ancelotti\'s men froze at Anfield in the last group match, tumbling out of the competition, despite only losing once. They almost achieved the miracle of qualifying from a group with five-times European champions Liverpool and cash kings Paris Saint-Germain. Almost.
That defeat by Klopp\'s Reds was indicative of a club with an inferiority complex in Europe. Throughout the years Napoli have had some fine players, from Maradona to Careca, Cavani to Koulibaly. Yet their record in continental competition is poor.
One of the reasons president Aurelio De Laurentiis hired Ancelotti was for his Euro-prowess. As a coach \'Carletto\' is one of only three men to win the Champions League three times. As a midfielder he lifted it twice.\xc2\xa0
The ex-Chelsea chief is a cup specialist, indeed his biography is called \'I Prefer the Cup\' which is a play on words on his trophy gathering and his favourite cut of meat, which runs from the neck to the shoulder of the pig, and is known as \'coppa\' in Italian.
Napoli\'s recent league form has been enough to put their boss off his dinner however. They toiled to a shock loss at Empoli and stalemate at home to Genoa.\xc2\xa0
Napoli have toiled in Serie A lately but it means more attention will be placed on Europe
On reason Ancelotti was hired by Napoli was because of his record in cup competitions\xc2\xa0
\'We aren\'t defending the way we should be. Recently our defending has been the worst since I arrived,\' said Ancelotti. The ongoing absence of injured centre-back Raul Albiol is a big blow.
The Italian team do hold one advantage over Arsenal. Napoli are guaranteed Champions League football next season, sitting seven points ahead of third-placed Inter and 12 points away from Atalanta in fifth.\xc2\xa0
They are fighting on one front, while Emery\'s men are languishing in fifth and desperate to return to Europe\'s top club tournament after a two-year absence. When asked about motivation, Ancelotti said \'if the players need a \'dream\' to aim for, we\'ve got one. It starts on Thursday night\'.
Napoli go into the quarter-final with concerns over midfield dynamo Allan\'s form. On song, the Brazilian is a buzzing menace, and Napoli need him to bounce back. On a more positive not, devilish Belgian forward Dries Mertens is crackling back into life after a patchy campaign and captain Insigne is back from a problem with his right thigh.
Napoli supporters are pleased with how Ancelotti has rotated the squad this season\xc2\xa0
There is no better time for Napoli to exorcise their ghosts than\xc2\xa0 the anniversary of a big triumph
Fans have appreciated how Ancelotti has rotated his squad much more than Maurizio Sarri did. In theory that will enable the team to tackle the final rounds of the Europa League with focus and freshness.
But, Carletto\'s real mission is the work on his players\' self-belief. Too many times the men from the Stadio San Paolo have succumbed to the pressure and anxiety of facing a prestigious opponent. There\'s no better time to exorcise those ghosts than on the 30th anniversary of their solitary European trophy.
Their feet, lungs and hearts have rarely been in doubt, but it\'s their minds which will hold the key in north London.


Amid Britain\xe2\x80\x99s political paralysis and the threats of a No Deal Brexit, the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s markets chief Valdis Dombrovskis is warning of disruption and potential liquidity problems.
This is in spite of the fact that the Bank of England has agreed with Brussels and Frankfurt\xe2\x80\x99s contingency measures to keep the system safe, including recognition by European regulators of the trillions of euros of contracts handled through City-based clearing houses.
The eurocrat is right to be cautious about the potential for financial system harm, especially as the European banking system is ill-equipped for another shock.
A devastating report from the Paris-based OECD notes that since 2000 the Italian economy - which then approximated to the size of Britain - has not grown by a euro
But Brussels also needs to ask itself questions as to what benefit will arise from being so difficult with Theresa May. Siemens UK chief Juergen Maier may think it is fitting to describe events in the Commons as turning Britain into a \xe2\x80\x98laughing stock.\xe2\x80\x99
But he should also recognise that the UK is among the least of the EU\xe2\x80\x99s economic problems.\xc2\xa0
A devastating report from the Paris-based OECD notes that since 2000 the Italian economy, which then approximated to the size of Britain, has not grown a euro.\xc2\xa0
In contrast the UK has added \xc2\xa31trillion to its national output and expanded by more than 40 per cent despite the deep trough following the financial crisis of 2008-09.
The granular detail of the OECD report on Italy is thoroughly disturbing.
The ratio of debt to national output stands at 138 per cent. Absolute poverty rates for young people are high. And the dearth of jobs means that young people are emigrating at alarming rates.
In Britain we talk of a North-South divide but it is as nothing as that between Italy\xe2\x80\x99s relatively healthy North and an impoverished South.
The UK\xe2\x80\x99s governance may be the butt of humour. However, the man behind Italy\xe2\x80\x99s ruling Five Star Movement coalition is a comedian, Beppe Grillo.\xc2\xa0
Italy\xe2\x80\x99s economy is forecast to shrink again and the jobless rate rise to 12 per cent, against the UK\xe2\x80\x99s 3.9 per cent.
Bad bank debts are shrinking. But it is still being kept afloat by extraordinary support from the European Central Bank.
The EU without Britain means that Italy would become the third-largest economy in the bloc. That is the real ticking timebomb at the heart of the EU.
Prime suspects
The war of words between sub-prime lenders Non-Standard Finance and Provident Financial shows no sign of cooling. NSF claims victory in its battle for a nil-premium control with 50.7 per cent of the stock committed to the takeover.
Its boss, John van Kuffeler, a frisky 70-year-old, can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to get his hands on his former firm. Provident has come back with serious financial questions about whether NSF is a safe owner, in that it has been paying dividends out of reserves that might be needed in a downturn.
NSF is shouting victory when it requires 90 per cent of votes for the offer to go unconditional. An obstacle is continuing regulatory questions. The Competition and Markets Authority, determined to show it is not a pushover, still has to rule.
More worrying is the prudential overhang. Both companies have had their difficulties with the Financial Conduct Authority.
Putting together two ethically challenged enterprises, lending at diabolically high interest rates, does not make for sound finance. The only way that this deal could be palatable is if it was seen as a chance to clean up the culture from the top, with an unsullied chief executive.
Van Kuffeler and his opposite number Malcolm le May, posh geezers exploiting the poor, are not the answer.
Comeback kid
The battle of the middle-aged fashion tycoons in overtight jeans has been won by Superdry\xe2\x80\x99s exiled founder Julian Dunkerton at a tumultuous shareholders meeting.
The tussle saw chief executive Euan Sutherland and chairman Peter Bamford heading for the door.
Dunkerton now has to find a way of reinvigorating the company he founded having watched from the sidelines as the fashion group issued two profit warnings and saw its shares (and much of Dunkerton\xe2\x80\x99s wealth) plunge in value by 64 per cent.
Once fashion businesses lose their mojo it is incredibly hard to turn them around, especially when the age gap between proprietors and customers gets ever wider.
Wanting back in is one thing. Rediscovering the fairy dust is quite another.

Former Swansea boss and ex-Porto defender Carlos Carvalhal delivers his insight on how the Portuguese champions will shape up against Liverpool at Anfield...
\xc2\xa0
STYLE
Porto\'s usual formation domestically this season has been 4-4-2, as Liverpool\'s scouts would have seen in Friday\'s 2-0 win over Boavista, but in Europe they\'ve set up in a 4-3-3, which is how they are likely to line up on Tuesday.
The front three will probably be Jesus Corona and Yacine Brahimi flanking the pace and strength of Moussa Marega down the middle.
Yacine Brahimi (centre) and Moussa Marega (right) will look to cause Liverpool problems
\xc2\xa0
ATTACKING SET-UP\xc2\xa0
Porto will try to get joy out wide, so it\'s vital left back Alex Telles recovers from his hip injury, because when Brahimi moves inside Telles is very good at attacking down his flank.
Porto look to pick out Brahimi between the lines when he drops inside to help organise the build-up play. Marega is a real threat, who excels in the channel between left back and left centre-back.
Andy Robertson\'s absence, however, could see manager Sergio Conceicao go for a bolder option on the counter with Francisco Soares up top and Marega out on the right.
It is vital for Porto that left back Alex Telles recovers from his hip injury and can play
\xc2\xa0
DEFENSIVE SET-UP
I imagine Porto, given Pepe\'s suspension, will line up with the excellent Eder Militao and Felipe at the heart of the defence, with experienced Uruguayan Maxi Pereira stepping in at right back.
There\'s a question mark over the left back role if Telles fails to recover, so young centre backs Diogo Leite and Diogo Queiros have been drafted into the squad.\xc2\xa0
Pepe is suspended for Tuesday\'s match but he has traveled to Anfield to give his support
\xc2\xa0
THE KEY BATTLES\xc2\xa0
Van Dijk v Marega
Marega has great power, while Van Dijk is also really strong. This will be a fascinating battle, especially if Marega can get in behind Milner.
Alexander-Arnold v Brahimi
Brahimi is a creative play-maker who will occupy the young right back\'s area. He\'s very dangerous around the box and possesses excellent dribbling skills so could test Alexander-Arnold defensively.
Salah v Telles
Salah is a great creative talent but could be forced to help out defensively against Telles, who is a very offensive-minded player and is influential to Porto\'s team play.
Mane v Maxi Pereira
Mane\'s pace and goal scoring instincts will test Pereira, who will need to use all his experience to stop Mane cutting inside dangerously.\xc2\xa0


PARIS, April 2 (Reuters) - Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said European leaders need to be open to any credible proposals that Britain\'s Theresa May puts forward to break the Brexit deadlock at an emergency summit next week.
"There is still time for the prime minister to come to the European Council with proposals, proposals that are credible and have a clear pathway to success," Varadkar said as he arrived in Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron.
"We need to be open to any proposals that she may bring forward to us," adding that as things stood Britain was heading towards a no-deal exit. (Reporting by Richard Lough and Michel Rose; editing by John Irish)


HELSINKI, April 2 (Reuters) - Finnish paper maker UPM said on Tuesday it planned to close a magazine paper machine in Germany, cutting output to match weaker demand and lowering costs.
UPM said it expected to cut 160 jobs at the Plattling mill near the Czech border and reduce the annual capacity of coated mechanical paper by 155,000 tonnes.
UPM is one of the world\'s largest makers of magazine paper, a sector which has been among the worst hit by a shift to digital publishing.
"Paper markets globally have been declining consistently over the past 10 years," Winfried Schaur, Executive Vice President at UPM Communication Papers, which includes magazine papers, said in a statement.
On Jan. 31, UPM forecast good demand in 2019 for most of its papers - excluding its Communications Papers unit, where it saw demand continuing to decline.
UPM will book 30 million euros ($34 million) in restructuring charges in the second quarter related to the closure, which will generate annual savings of 17 million euros.

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - A Lithuanian man flying to Italy got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane: He was the only passenger on the Boeing 737-800.
Skirmantas Strimaitis, who was flying from capital Vilnius to the northern Italian city of Bergamo for a skiing holiday March 16, had the whole plane - which can usually sit up to 188 people - to himself. The only others onboard were two pilots and five crew members.
The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one.
Strimaitis told The Associated Press Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was "a once in the lifetime experience."


DUBLIN, April 3 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May\'s decision to open Brexit talks with the opposition Labour Party has reduced the chances of the UK crashing out of the European Union without a deal, Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said on Wednesday.
"The statement last night from Prime Minister May was a very significant moment" that reduces the chances of a no-deal Brexit, Donohoe told Ireland\'s RTE radio. But he said the risk of a no-deal Brexit remained significant. (Reporting by Conor Humphries; Editing by Hugh Lawson)


A newborn boy has died following a botched circumcision attempt in Italy.
The boy reportedly died overnight on Tuesday near the port city of Genoa after his 25-year-old Nigerian mother and his grandmother called for emergency medical help.\xc2\xa0When the ambulance arrived the child had already died.
His death is the third of its kind in the country in recent months, with a five-month-old and a two-year-old dying in similar circumstances.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
An infant died in the port city of Genoa on Tuesday night after a botched circumcision (stock image of tools for circumcision)
In the latest case, investigators told Italian news agency\xc2\xa0ANSA they suspected a third person carried out the circumcision and are checking the mother and grandmother\'s phone records to trace the suspect.
It is the third case of its kind in the last few months. A five-month-old baby died in Bologna last month after his parents performed a circumcision at home.
A manslaughter investigation was opened against the boy\'s parents - said to be of Ghanaian origin - by the prosecutor\'s office in the northern province of Reggio Emilia.
In December last year, a two-year-old boy died of severe blood loss as a result of a botched circumcision in Rome.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
In that case, his twin brother also nearly died but survived following intensive care treatment.\xc2\xa0
That operation had taken place in a centre provided by the non-profit organisation Arci and the council in Monterondo, a north-western suburb of Rome.

The doctor, who was believed to be an American citizen of Libyan origin, called for emergency help when the boy began excessively bleeding, Italian media reported at the time.\xc2\xa0
Circumcision is not practised among Italy\'s Roman Catholic majority.
It is largely the practise of Muslim immigrants who sometimes have trouble finding provisions for the procedure in hospital, either for cost or because some doctors refuse to perform circumcisions until boys are at least four.


April 1 (Reuters) - British low-cost airline easyJet on Monday took a more cautious stance on its outlook for the second half of the year as Brexit jitters result in weaker customer demand, hurting ticket pricing across Europe.
The carrier, which is the largest operator at Britain\'s second-biggest airport Gatwick, said it expects to report first-half pretax loss of about 275 million pounds ($359.12 million), with costs set to rise 18.8 percent.
"For the second half, we are seeing softness in both the UK and Europe, which we believe comes from macroeconomic uncertainty and many unanswered questions surrounding Brexit which are together driving weaker customer demand," Chief Executive Officer Johan Lundgren said in a statement.
The carrier said it expects revenue for the six months ended March to grow 7.3 percent to about 2.34 billion pounds, with seat capacity increasing 14.5 percent to about 46.2 million pounds.
EasyJet said its European ownership requirements, excluding UK shareholders, had now reached 49.92 percent.
The carrier had last month said it was ready to suspend the voting rights of a small number of shares to comply with rules that require 50 percent plus one share of the company to be owned by EU shareholders following Brexit.
Once Britain leaves the European Union, airlines that will not be majority owned by EU nationals face the threat of losing their right to fly within the EU due to share ownership rules, forcing the airlines to spell out their contingency plans.
EasyJet shares were expected to fall between 3-5 percent at open in London, according to traders.

SARAJEVO, April 9 (Reuters) - Bosnia will not send representatives to the Council of Europe\'s assembly this year, because the country\'s rival ethnic groups have failed to form a government or to nominate delegates, a minister said on Tuesday.
European officials warned Bosnia\'s new central parliament last week it had to nominate representatives to the Council\'s assembly by Sunday. But parliament, which does not have a clear ruling majority, failed to convene.
Under the Council of Europe rules, member countries must appoint their new delegations within six months of their latest election. Otherwise, they face an interim suspension.
"This failure has inflicted great damage to the international reputation of Bosnia-Herzegovina ... at the time when we make major efforts towards European Union integration," Foreign Minister Igor Crnadak said at a news conference.
Crnadak is serving in a caretaker capacity after political divisions made it impossible to form a new cabinet following October presidential and parliamentary elections. The political deadlock will further slow the country\'s progress towards joining the EU.
"This is a major step backwards," Crnadak said.
The main disagreement between the Serb, Croat and Bosniak members of the tripartite presidency, which needs to appoint a prime minister-designate, is over whether Bosnia should pursue NATO membership.
The Bosniak and Croat members say NATO membership will safeguard the volatile Balkan country from a new conflict like Bosnia\'s devastating war in the 1990s. The Serbs are against NATO, which bombed them during the war.
The Serb chairman, Milorad Dodik, has repeatedly accused Bosniak political parties of dragging out formation of a government to serve their own political interests.
"Bosnia-Herzgovina is a failed state," Dodik said on Tuesday. "We have not succeeded in doing anything." (Reporting by Daria Sito-Sucic; editing by Larry King)


FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.

1:50 p.m.
The European Central Bank has kept its policy promises, interest rates and stimulus settings unchanged as officials weigh looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a news conference Thursday, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more monetary stimulus in coming months. Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for an interest rate increase from the end of the year into next year.

BUDAPEST, April 9 (Reuters) - A small group of Hungarian business leaders and politicians close to Prime Minister Viktor Orban have founded an international news agency in London that aims to cover news especially in central and eastern Europe.
Orban\'s associates have gained control over a large chunk of Hungary\'s media in recent years and his Fidesz party has taken total control of state media, provoking international accusations that they are weakening freedom of speech.
However, Orban has been unable to control international news coverage, which has been far more critical of him than local media. The new agency\'s early content suggests it is more sympathetic to him.
The new company, called V4NA, was registered in London by Hungary\'s ambassador to the UK, Kristof Szalay-Bobrovniczky, on Dec. 31, 2018, according to company filings.
Last month, Arpad Habony, Orban\'s main spin doctor and eminence grise, acquired a 40 percent stake in V4NA via his London political advisory firm, Danube Business Consulting Ltd.
Subsequently, New Wave Media Group, owned by KESMA, a foundation that controls most of Hungary\'s pro-government media, acquired a 57 percent stake from Szalay-Bobrovniczky.
Despite its huge role in the Hungarian media market, KESMA was exempted from regulatory scrutiny last year on grounds that it was a strategic national asset.
V4NA\'s name reflects a focus on the Visegrad Four countries - Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic. It plans to focus more on other centres in the run-up to European Parliament elections due in May.
"Our team of 50 journalists and rapid-response news teams are on location where the leading stories happen in Europe: London, Brussels, Paris, Berlin, Prague, Budapest, Belgrade, Bratislava, Warsaw," the agency says on its web site, V4NA.com.
Most of the site\'s content is behind a paywall, but the selection of front-page headlines resonates with the populism of Orban, one of the fiercest critics of immigration to Europe.
"Migrant kills wife after she converts to Christianity," says one headline from Monday. A report about Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy\'s League, anti-immigrant interior minister and ally of Orban, was headlined "Salvini: Citizens should control Europe".
"Hungarian minister on EP elections: Hungarian votes also matter" and "Immigration is a war of cultures and civilisations" were headlines that borrowed directly from Orban\'s rhetoric.
V4NA and KESMA did not immediately reply to Reuters\' questions. Habony could not be reached for comment. (Reporting by Marton Dunai; Editing by Kevin Liffey)


BELFAST, April 2 (Reuters) - It remains to be seen whether British Prime Minister Theresa May can successfully agree a EU divorce deal with opponents in parliament whom she has demonised for years, the Northern Irish party propping up her government said on Tuesday.
"Her announcement tonight comes as little surprise. Though it remains to be seen if sub-contracting out the future of Brexit to (Labour Party leader) Jeremy Corbyn, someone whom the Conservatives have demonised for four years, will end happily," the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said in a statement following May\'s change of strategy.
"We want the result of the referendum respected, and just as we joined the Common Market as one country we must leave the EU as one country. We remain consistent in judging all Brexit outcomes against our clear unionist principles." (Reporting by Amanda Ferguson, writing by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Tom Brown)


European football\'s crackdown against racist behaviour by supporters has continued with punishments for Croatian champions GNK Dinamo and Ukraine\'s Dynamo Kiev.
Last week, UEFA ordered Italy\'s Lazio, Ukrainian champions Shakhtar Donetsk and Czech side Slavia Prague to play their next home European ties in front of partially closed stadiums following racist chanting and other crowd disturbances in recent Europa League matches.
And on Monday, UEFA\'s control, ethics and disciplinary body ruled that GNK Dinamo\'s next two home games in European competition should take place behind closed doors, with the second of those games deferred for two years, while Dynamo Kiev were given the lesser sanction of a partial closure.
UEFA have handed out stadium punishments to both GNK Dinamo (pictured) and Dynamo Kiev
GNK Dinamo\'s next two home games in Europe will take place behind closed doors, UEFA ruled
GNK Dinamo\'s offences took place during the first leg of the last-16 game against Benfica last month and they were also fined \xc2\xa340,000 for their fans setting off fireworks, throwing objects and blocking stairways, with a further \xc2\xa317,000 levied for the racism.
Dynamo Kiev were also charged with a range of offences, including racist behaviour, following their last-32 game against Olympiakos in February but, as this was a first offence, they were treated more leniently.
The Ukrainians came through that tie but were then soundly beaten by Chelsea in the last 16, although the Premier League side were also sanctioned by UEFA on Monday for the behaviour of their fans in their last-32 game against Malmo in Sweden on February 14.
Dynamo Kiev were also charged with a range of offences, including racist behaviour from fans
As this was a first offence, Dynamo Kiev were treated more leniently with only a partial closure
The Blues were given a \xc2\xa311,000 fine for their fans throwing objects and invading the pitch, while their hosts were hit with a \xc2\xa349,000 fine because their supporters also threw objects and set off fireworks.
Monday\'s punishments for racist behaviour come a week after several England players were racially abused by Montenegro fans during their Euro 2020 qualifier in Podgorica and on the eve of a two-day anti-discrimination conference at Wembley co-hosted by UEFA, the Football Association and European campaign group Fare Network.


ROME, April 4 (Reuters) - Italian right-wing leader Matteo Salvini on Thursday told Berlin to take responsibility for 64 migrants rescued in the Mediterranean by a German charity boat and heading towards the Italian coast in rough seas.
As interior minister and deputy prime minister, Salvini has led a crackdown on illegal immigration by closing Italian ports to humanitarian vessels since his League party formed a coalition last year with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.
"I asked the German interior minister to intervene over a ship that says it is German, and to fix this issue," Salvini told reporters in Paris during a G7 interior ministers\' summit.
The Alan Kurdi vessel run by the German charity Sea-Eye rescued the migrants on Wednesday off Libya. They include 12 women, an 11-month-old girl and a 6-year-old boy, a Sea-Eye source said.
The ship is now heading towards the small Italian island of Lampedusa, an Italian Interior Ministry spokesman said.
"We are currently in contact with the German authorities, looking for a solution. We are heading to Lampedusa to avoid bad weather in Malta", the Sea-Eye source said.

The Government has tabled an order enabling elections to the European Parliament to be held in Britain if the country has not left the EU by the time they take place next month.
The Day of Poll Order sets the date for the elections on May 23, but the Cabinet Office said they would automatically be cancelled if the UK left before then.
The announcement comes as Theresa May prepares for talks on Tuesday with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin and President Emmanuel Macron in Paris ahead of another crucial EU summit in Brussels the following day.
The Prime Minister has acknowledged that if the EU is to grant an extension to the Article 50 withdrawal process beyond Friday \xe2\x80\x93 the final day for calling the elections in the UK \xe2\x80\x93 the Government would have be prepared for the UK to take part in them.
However, a Cabinet Office spokesman said it was still the Government\xe2\x80\x99s aim to leave with a deal before that became necessary.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt remains the Government\xe2\x80\x99s intention to leave the EU with a deal and pass the necessary legislation before May 22, so that we do not need to participate in European parliamentary elections,\xe2\x80\x9d the spokesman said.

\xe2\x80\x9cAs a responsible Government today we have taken the necessary steps required by law should we have to participate.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe Day of Poll Order provides returning officers with a date to hold potential European Parliamentary elections, but it does not make these elections inevitable as leaving the EU before the date of election automatically removes our obligation to take part.\xe2\x80\x9d


BERLIN (AP) - Pharma and chemicals giant Bayer says it is cutting 4,500 jobs in its home market of Germany.
Bayer said Tuesday that the positions are part of 12,000 job cuts around announced last year. The company currently has about 32,100 employees in Germany.
Bayer is fighting the fallout from lawsuits over the alleged carcinogenic effects of Roundup, a weed killer it acquired with the purchase of American agrochemicals rival Monsanto. Bayer says that scientific evidence shows the product is safe and regulators have supported that conclusion.


MILAN (AP) - Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte has inaugurated the twisting 44-story Generali Tower designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid.
The 190-meter (623-foot) tower, which will serve as a headquarters for the Italian insurance company Generali, was dedicated Tuesday on the first day of the annual Milan Furniture Fair that celebrates design.
The Generali Tower is one of three skyscrapers that punctuate "CityLife," a redevelopment project of the old fair grounds that incorporates parks, apartments, offices and a vast shopping area. The other towers were designed by Daniel Libeskind and Arata Isozaki.
Hadid\'s tower twists as it rises, with the upper floors facing Milan\'s centerpiece Duomo cathedral in the center of the city.
Generali chairman Gabriele Galateri called the tower "a true element of development for Milan," with a focus on sustainability.

BERLIN, April 10 (Reuters) - The German Defence Ministry estimates it will cost nearly 9 billion euros to replace obsolescent parts and keep its ageing fleet of 93 Tornado fighter jets flying until 2030, according to a classified document provided to German lawmakers this week.
The steep cost estimate includes 5.64 billion euros to maintain the warplanes, which first entered service in 1983, 1.62 billion euros to design replacements for obsolete parts, and 1.58 billion euros to procure them, according to the document, which was viewed by Reuters.
Germany in January decided to pick either the Eurofighter or Boeing Co\'s F/A-18E/F fighter jet to replace its Tornado fleet in coming years, dropping Lockheed Martin\'s F-35 stealth fighter from a tender worth billions of euros. .
But neither the F/A-18 nor the Eurofighter are currently certified to carry U.S. nuclear weapons, as required under Germany\'s obligations to NATO, leaving Germany dependent on its Tornado fleet until it gets new planes. (Reporting by Andrea Shalal, editing by Thomas Escritt)


British passports without the words European Union on the front cover have been issued despite the Brexit delay.
The burgundy passports were introduced from March 30 - the day after Britain was expected to leave the EU.
Some passports including the words European Union will continue to be issued while the remaining stock is used up.
But those applying for a new travel document will not be able to choose between the two.
British passports without the words European Union on the front cover have been issued despite the Brexit delay. The burgundy passports were introduced from March 30 - the day after Britain was expected to leave the EU
Susan Hindle Barone, who picked up her new passport on Friday, said on Twitter she was \'truly appalled\'.
\'I was just surprised - we\'re still members of the EU,\' she told the Press Association.
\'I was surprised they\'ve made the change when we haven\'t left, and it\'s a tangible mark of something which I believe to be completely futile. What do we gain by leaving? There\'s certainly a whole lot we lose.\'
She added: \'Let\'s face it, it\'s not the changes to the passport - it\'s just symbolic.
\'What really matters are the potential changes to our country - the damage to the economy, our communities and our international standing.\'
The decision to remove the words was made in anticipation of Britain leaving the EU at the end of last month.
\'There will be no difference for British citizens whether they are using a passport that includes the words European Union, or a passport that does not. Both designs will be equally valid for travel,\' a\xc2\xa0Home Office spokeswoman said
Dark blue passports are scheduled to be issued from the end of this year.
A Home Office spokeswoman said: \'Burgundy passports that no longer include the words European Union on the front cover were introduced from 30 March 2019.
\'In order to use leftover stock and achieve best value to the taxpayer, passports that include the words European Union will continue to be issued for a short period after this date.
\'There will be no difference for British citizens whether they are using a passport that includes the words European Union, or a passport that does not. Both designs will be equally valid for travel.\'


Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has admitted that he cannot guarantee his social network won\'t be used to influence the outcome of the European elections.\xc2\xa0
Mr Zuckerberg, who spoke in Ireland after visiting the social network\'s European headquarters, said Facebook has taken steps to protect the democratic process since Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election in the US.
But he described the situation as an \'ongoing arms race\' pitting \'sophisticated nation states\' against technology giants, meaning a final solution will likely never be found.

Mark Zuckerberg described the fight against election meddling by foreign governments as an \'arms race\' and admitted a final solution might never be found (file image)
Speaking to Irish broadcaster RTE, he said: \'We\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly made a lot of progress in building defences to protect the integrity of elections.
\'But no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone can guarantee in a world where you have nation states [that] are trying to interfere in elections there is no single thing that we can do, and say okay, we have now solved the issue.
\'This is an ongoing arms race.\'
The European elections are due to take at the end of May when more than 700 positions in the European Parliament will be voted on by 27 member states.
Voters in the United Kingdom are not expected to take part as the country was supposed to have left the European Union by the time the election starts.\xc2\xa0
Mr Zuckerberg also qualified comments he made weeks ago calling for governments to take a greater role in regulating social media, denying that he had been trying to shirk responsibility for the issue.
Instead, he said that people want governments to be taking the lead over private companies or individuals like himself.
\'I think these days a lot of people don\xe2\x80\x99t want tech companies or any private companies to be making so many decisions about what speech is acceptable and what this harmful content that needs to be gets taken down,\' he said.
\'So I think there is a role for a broader public debate here and I think some of these things would benefit from a more democratic process and a more active government role.\'
Mr Zuckerberg spoke out after travelling to Facebook\'s EU headquarters in Dublin Tuesday to discuss with politicians how best to regulate the social network\xc2\xa0
It comes after Mr Zuckerberg met with\xc2\xa0politicians\xc2\xa0Hildegarde Naughton, James Lawless and Eamon Ryan to discuss what could be done to regulate social media.\xc2\xa0
The three members of the International Grand Committee on Disinformation and Fake News described the Facebook boss as \'quiet, unassuming, pleasant and smart.\'
Former British deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, now serving as Facebook\'s head of global affairs and communications, was also at the meeting.
Mr Zuckerberg told the politicians that issues around child protection and age verification are of \'huge concern\' to him.\xc2\xa0
Ms Naughton described the meeting as \'positive and constructive\'.
\'We went through a number of issues including child protection and the need for a robust age verification system,\' she said.
The three members of the International Grand Committee on Disinformation and Fake News described the Facebook boss as \'quiet, unassuming, pleasant and smart\'
\'He said it was an area of huge concern to him and that he is looking forward to working with law enforcement agencies and legislators in relation to that. We have to balance the state of privacy of users as well as safety.
\'He stated he had a lot more work to do.
\'Our committee is working on a number of pieces of legislation including an online safety commissioner as well as looking at and protecting democracy.
\'I mentioned the importance around age verification because you have right now paedophiles online lying about their age and preying on young children and grooming them.
\'This is something he acknowledged, he knew it was a problem and he stated that he wanted to work with law enforcement agencies and policy makers to make more robust laws.\'\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
The TDs held an hour-long meeting with him days after he called for increased government oversight of the internet in areas like harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.
Mr Lawless said: \'Our focus was also on electoral integrity and what has been happening around the world on the rules in managing election campaigns.
\'He agreed legislation is needed, he is working on those internationally to be able to see who is running campaigns, who is paying for campaigns and who is being targeted.
\'It shouldn\'t be about the private companies dictating what goes online when it comes to democracy and child protection and safety, we as legislators have responsibilities to put in place rules that we think should be followed and dictating to companies about how behaviours are conducted online.\'
Mark Zuckerberg assured senior Irish politicians Hildegarde Naughton, James Lawless (right) and Eamon Ryan he will work with governments to establish new policies in a bid to regulate social media during a meeting at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin
Nick Clegg, the former leader of the British Liberal Democrats, accompanied Mr Zuckerberg in his new role as head of global affairs
Mr Ryan said: \'I pressed him about the article he wrote on regulation and I made the point that it can\'t be self-regulation it has to be European regulation and that has to include funding journalism and having a courts procedure rather than a self-appointed board to look at difficult decisions.\'\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Mr Zuckerberg also visited the technology giant\'s European Headquarters as part of his visit to the Republic.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
But he refused to answer questions from the media about online child safety as he left the Merrion Hotel.\xc2\xa0
The International Grand Committee on Disinformation and Fake News is made up of international parliamentarians and investigates issues like data privacy, safety, security and sharing.
The three TDs, who are also members of the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, have been vocal in demanding the regulation of social media platforms in recent years.
Ireland\'s Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon has a number of inquiries ongoing into Facebook and associated organisations.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
According to the Irish Times Mr Zuckerberg praised Europe\'s introduction of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which tightened up rules regarding data privacy.
The social network founder said GDPR was a good foundation that encoded a lot of important values around people being able to choose how their data is used, and at the same time making sure that companies have the ability to use information for safety purposes.
He added that it was almost inevitable that every country was going to want comprehensive privacy legislation.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0


The UK has the highest prison population in western Europe, a new report has found.
A snapshot of figures showed more than 90,000 people were locked up in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Of more than 40 administrations included in the analysis, only Russia had more inmates, with just over 600,000.

The UK has had the highest prison population in the EU every year since 2008 at least, according to the Council of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s annual penal statistics.
It said there were 84,373 inmates in England and Wales at the end of 2017, including a small number of individuals in immigration detention.

The number of inmates in England and Wales, which has nearly doubled in 25 years, has come under the spotlight after a safety crisis swept through much of the estate.
Ministers are considering scrapping sentences of six months or less for some offences in an effort to drive down re-offending rates and relieve pressure on crowded jails.


BERLIN (AP) - Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.
Affordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\'t think that is the right solution. He said "the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available."
Andres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a "false solution."

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) - Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries - the 8th so far - that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members - or those hoping to join - could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.

Of the 16 participating countries - Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia - 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

BERLIN (AP) - A group of 14 European scientific institutions plan to retrieve the world\'s oldest ice as part of research into past climate change.
The consortium led by the Germany-based Alfred Wegener Institute said Tuesday it has identified an area in Antarctica, nicknamed "Little Dome C," that should harbor ice as old as 1.5 million years.
So-called ice core measurements are crucial for scientists\' understanding of past climatic changes on Earth and the models they use to predict future global warming or cooling.
Current ice core measurements provide reliable data going back only about 800,000 years.
At a meeting in Vienna, the institutes said they spent the past three years working with American, Australian, Japanese and Russian colleagues using radar to determine the best possible site for drilling.

Western Europe\xe2\x80\x99s tallest building is set to be erected in the tiny rural town of Brande in Denmark, which has a population of just 7,000 people.
The skyscraper will be the headquarters of fashion giant Bestseller, which was founded in the town in 1975, and at 320 metres (1,049 feet) will be ten metres taller than London\xe2\x80\x99s Shard. An eye-popping rendering shows how the building will dominate the flat countryside around it \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99ll be visible from around 60km (37 miles) away.\xc2\xa0
Bestseller says it\'ll become a landmark, though perhaps not in a good way. It\'s been compared to The Tower of Sauron in Lord of the Rings.
The skyscraper will be the headquarters of fashion giant Bestseller and at 320 metres (1,049 feet), will be ten metres taller than London\xe2\x80\x99s Shard
Bestseller - which is owned by Anders Holch Povlsen, Denmark\xe2\x80\x99s richest man - calls the plan the Tower & Village project, and says that it is a \xe2\x80\x98rethink\xe2\x80\x99 of the classic idea of a headquarters
The tongue-in-cheek comparison was made by a Danish satirical publication called Rokokoposten, according to The Guardian, which wrote a spoof article in which Sauron was quoted as saying: \xe2\x80\x98I have offered to finance a major interactive art installation in the form of a blazing eye at the very top of the building.\xe2\x80\x99
The Guardian says that there are also serious objections to the project.
It quotes Aarhus architect Trine Kammer as saying that the building will destroy \xe2\x80\x98undisturbed landscape\xe2\x80\x99.
The project has, nevertheless, received approval from the city council and one local reporter from Brande told The Guardian: \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to find anyone here who is opposed to the tower.\xe2\x80\x99
The complex will become home to 30 stores, educational facilities, hotel accommodation and multiple Bestseller offices
Bestseller - which is owned by Anders Holch Povlsen, Denmark\xe2\x80\x99s richest man - calls the plan the Tower & Village project, and says that it is a \xe2\x80\x98rethink\xe2\x80\x99 of the classic idea of a headquarters.
The complex, designed by architect firm Dorte Mandrup, will become home to 30 stores, educational facilities, hotel accommodation and multiple Bestseller offices.
Hans Ulbrichsen, from Brande Trade Association, said: \xe2\x80\x98We see Bestseller\xe2\x80\x99s project plan as a great opportunity for the town. An opportunity that can help create a dynamic life in all of Brande \xe2\x80\x93 not just for Bestseller \xe2\x80\x93 but very much also for the local businesses in Brande. A larger customer base is beneficial for all parties.
\xe2\x80\x98The overall building project is thought as an investment in Brande, and the planned high-rise building will function as an icon for the new expansion. It will be a landmark that places Brande on the map, but it will also function as an architectural attraction benefitting hotel guests, students and other users of the building.\xe2\x80\x99
Project Manager Anders Krogh said: \xe2\x80\x98We are very pleased that the plans have now been approved by the city council and we are extremely proud and humbled by the amount of support our project has received, especially locally. It is important for us to underline that the city council\xe2\x80\x99s approval is merely one of the preliminary steps of a long journey.
\xe2\x80\x98The city council\xe2\x80\x99s approval is obviously essential, but we still have a lot of homework to do and much to consider before a project like this can be brought to life. We still have years ahead of us before a potential start date.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0


Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, pictured February 2019, said that his country would continue to pressure European countries to act on their obligations within the Iran nuclear deal but added that "we never had any hopes" in them
Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said on Wednesday European powers were incapable of bypassing sanctions imposed on Tehran by the US after it withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal.
Iran and six world powers agreed on a deal in 2015 that severely restricted Tehran\'s nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief and economic incentives.
However President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from the deal -- technically called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) -- last May, reimposing punishing sanctions on the Islamic republic.
The other parties to the nuclear deal -- Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia along with the European Union -- however insist they remain committed to making the deal work.
"The Europeans at first viewed the JCPOA (nuclear deal) as an achievement, but maybe they were not prepared to, and certainly they were not capable of standing up against U.S sanctions," Zarif said in an interview with Khamenei.ir, the official website of Iran\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
"We will continue pressing the Europeans to implement their commitments. Europe must know that they cannot shy away from their responsibilities with a few statements and some unaccomplished plans," he added.
Zarif, who was his country\'s chief negotiator in the negotiations leading to the deal, said that Iran would continue to pressure the Europeans to act on their obligations within the deal but added that "we never had any hopes" in them.
Instead of the western powers the Islamic republic has turned to its traditional partners such as Russia and China, Zarif said, adding "the future of our foreign policy lies in that way."


Alfredo Morelos is the man with the shortest fuse in football and was sent off yet again for Rangers in their Old Firm defeat by Celtic on Sunday.\xc2\xa0
The irate Colombian can be depended on to explode at the merest hint of provocation and reacted to a slight bump by Scott Brown by elbowing him straight in the face.\xc2\xa0
Steven Gerrard was left shaking his head in dismay and after seeing the striker walk prematurely down the tunnel for the fifth time this season, said he couldn\'t defend him anymore.\xc2\xa0
Alfredo Morelos (centre) was shown a fifth red card this season for his elbow on Scott Brown
The Colombian, sent off here in Agusust against Aberdeen, now holds the European record
There are a number of statistics that shame Morelos and put his ludicrous diciplinary record under the spotlight.\xc2\xa0
He currently has more red cards than any other team in the Scottish Premiership this season.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
In fact, the combustable 22-year-old\'s five dismissals is more than there were in the entire World Cup in Russia last year (4).\xc2\xa0
Morelos prides himself on being a ferocious competitor but his emotion regularly spills over
When you consider that 736 players were in action at the tournament, his indiscipline is even more staggering.\xc2\xa0
He also now has the dubious honour of breaking the European record for the most red cards in one campaign.\xc2\xa0
The fifth meant he overtook team-mate Ryan Jack, though two of his four were recinded, and notoriously fiery Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
In 27 matches this season, Morelos has 17 goals, four assists nine yellow cards and five reds.\xc2\xa0
Morelos has been Rangers\' best player this season but also let Steven Gerrard down
The striker can be easily wound up by opponents and they deliberately antagonise him
Having left his side battling with ten men against Celtic on Sunday, in a game they eventually lost 2-1, Morelos is now facing a four game suspension.\xc2\xa0
By the time he has served the ban, he will have missed a grand total of ten matches including 4 hours 13 minutes of game time in the matches he\'s been sent off in.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Given his undeniable ability as Rangers\' main goal threat, their season could have gone entirely differently if he\'d managed to temper his aggression.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0

NEW YORK, April 9 (Reuters) - The dollar fell and the rally in global equities lost steam on Tuesday as a U.S. threat to slap tariffs on hundreds of European goods and a downgrade by the International Monetary Fund in its global economic growth forecasts dimmed the appetite for risk.
The IMF warned that growth could slow further due to trade tensions and a potentially disorderly British exit from the European Union. China, Germany and other major economies might need to take short-term actions to prop up growth, the IMF said.
Asian shares rose to an eight-month high overnight but U.S. and European markets fell after President Donald Trump welcomed the World Trade Organization\'s finding that Europe\'s subsidies to planemaker Airbus had hurt the United States.
The U.S. Trade Representative on Monday proposed a range of EU products, from large commercial aircraft and parts to dairy products and wine, to target as retaliation for subsidies given to Airbus.
Equities fell in Europe and on Wall Street, poised to snap an eight-day rally for the S&P 500, after an EU official said the European trade bloc was beginning preparations to retaliate over Boeing subsidies.
Uncertainty over tariffs and trade between the United States and China have dented business confidence and led corporate investment to dry up, said Hank Smith, co-chief investment officer at The Haverford Trust Co in Radnor, Pennsylvania.
"Business investment is now being put on hold because of the uncertainty around tariffs," he said.
MSCI\'s all-country world index, a gauge of stock performance in 47 countries, fell 0.36%. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.38% and the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares fell 0.4%.
Airbus said it saw no legal basis for the U.S. move toward imposing tariffs on its aircraft and warned of deepening trade tensions.
Shares in Airbus fell 1.86% and many of its key suppliers lost between 0.7% and 1.2%. Boeing shares fell 1.3% ahead of its aircraft delivery and order numbers for March.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 169.99 points, or 0.65%, to 26,171.03. The S&P 500 lost 15.24 points, or 0.53%, to 2,880.53 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 25.92 points, or 0.33%, to 7,927.97.
The yen rose as traders favored the safe-haven currency in the wake of the U.S. proposal for tariffs on European goods.
The dollar index fell 0.09%, with the euro up 0.1% to $1.127. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.32% versus the greenback at 111.13 per dollar.
U.S. Treasury yields slid, pressured by concerns about the IMF\'s global economic outlook for 2019 as well as a round of headlines on Britain\'s messy departure from the EU.
In Europe, government borrowing costs in southern countries hit fresh lows, pushed down by hopes that this week\'s European Central Bank meeting will reinforce expectations for supportive policy measures in the months ahead.
Portugal\'s 10-year government bond yield fell to 1.212% , its lowest in at least 25 years.
Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes rose 5/32 in price to push yields down to 2.5006%.
Oil fell from a five-month high above $71 a barrel after Russia signaled a possible easing of a supply-cutting deal with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries offset concern that violence in Libya could further tighten markets.
Brent, the global benchmark, rose to $71.34 a barrel, the highest since November, but later fell 53 cents to $70.57. U.S. crude also hit a November 2018 high of $64.79 but was later down 65 cents at $64.75.

WASHINGTON, April 10 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that the State Department was looking closely at Qatar Airways\' acquisition of a 49 percent stake in Air Italy.
Questioned repeatedly about the deal during a U.S. Senate hearing, Pompeo said, "We\'re looking very closely at this recent decision by Qatar to take on 49 percent of this airline."
Both Republicans and Democrats at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing said they were concerned that the deal with the Italian carrier violated an agreement Qatar Airways reached with the United States in early 2018.
"There are lots of consultations taking place," Pompeo said.
An aide to Senator Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the committee, noted that January marked the one-year anniversary of agreements between the United States and Qatar on government subsidies to state-owned Qatar Airways.
In a side letter to the agreement, the Qatari government indicated there was no intention to launch additional flights from Qatar but picking up passengers in Europe before flying to U.S. destinations.
The aide said the acquisition of Air Italy and transforming it into a carrier with five U.S. destinations from Milan runs counter to the agreement with Qatar Airways. (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle and Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jonathan Oatis)

ZURICH, April 3 (Reuters) - Europe\'s domestic leagues, concerned about plans to drastically overhaul football on the continent from 2024, say they will not allow UEFA club competitions to be played at weekends.
The topic, alongside the revenue distribution model for the Champions League and Europa League, is set to dominate discussions when the European Leagues umbrella organisation holds a general assembly in Lisbon on Friday.
UEFA has recently begun discussions with the continent\'s clubs over the format for European competitions from 2024.
The European Club Association (ECA) has said it wants more teams playing more games in European competition although, after meeting in Amsterdam last week, added that it was too early to give details on what was being planned.
However, the European Leagues are concerned that European soccer\'s governing body UEFA could ultimately give captive places to some bigger clubs and play matches at weekends.
"We will always protect our weekends. We will not allow European club competition to be played at weekends," European Leagues Deputy General Secretary Alberto Colombo told Reuters.
"The passion of football fans is driven by local football and by their tradition to go to the stadium with family and friends on Saturday and Sunday."
Colombo added that under the current model the clubs earned places in UEFA club competition by finishing at the top of their respective leagues.
"If you give the big clubs guaranteed places in UEFA Club Competition and you destroy this model, it will devalue domestic football which drives the passion of fans," he said.
European club football runs in three-year cycles with the current one ending in 2021.
The format for the 2021-24 cycle was decided last year with the addition of a new third-tier competition in addition to the Champions League and the Europa League.
However, revenue distribution for the 2021-24 cycle has not been settled and European Leagues are arguing for a greater share of the spoils to be given to the clubs who do not qualify for European competition.
It wants so-called solidarity payments to be increased from the current 7.3 percent to 20 percent in the next cycle.
In a recent statement, the Leagues said it was "imperative to increase solidarity so as to safeguard the dream of all clubs, and not just a few rich ones, to perform in a fair competitive environment." (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)


VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - A Lithuanian man flying to Italy got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane: He was the only passenger on the Boeing 737-800.
Skirmantas Strimaitis, who was flying from capital Vilnius to the northern Italian city of Bergamo for a skiing holiday March 16, had the whole plane - which can usually sit up to 188 people - to himself. The only others onboard were two pilots and five crew members.
The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one.
Strimaitis told The Associated Press Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was "a once in the lifetime experience."


A new Dublin coffee shop may be the first in Ireland where customers cannot pay with cash.
Bear Market Coffee, in George Street, is completely cash-free, which owners Ruth and Stephen Deasy say means staff can concentrate on providing better customer service.
Ruth said cutting out the cash means less stress for baristas.
Stephen and Ruth\xc2\xb4s Bear Market Coffee shop may be the first in Ireland where customers cannot pay with cash (PA)
\xe2\x80\x9cWe do get times where everyone comes in together, with 20 or 30 people in the queue,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth said.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve found that the person on the till is quite stressed trying to sort out change, so they\xe2\x80\x99re not really engaging or explaining different cakes that we have because they\xe2\x80\x99re under pressure to get down the line.
\xe2\x80\x9cWith contactless, the customer just taps their card, so they can spend more time talking to staff or explaining what they want, and everything can be done really efficiently.\xe2\x80\x9d
Bear Market partnered with Magnet Networks,\xc2\xa0a telecommunications and data connectivity provider, to include a pre-order app and WiFi.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe have so many lines that if one goes down, another can pick up, we\xe2\x80\x99ve two tills, two credit card machines, the till system will be on a different WiFi from our customers, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no cross over.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really secure, really high-end, so we\xe2\x80\x99ve hopefully thought of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d
She said the idea came after a visit to a cashless store in New York, and added: \xe2\x80\x9cWe thought it was a lot more relaxed and a quicker process to get to the till and get your coffee, and the customer service element was more streamlined.
\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we started looking at our figures, we found that around 80% of our sales were on card.\xe2\x80\x9d


Hundreds of people have gathered in Dublin to celebrate Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s links with Japan.

Europe\'s rivers and canals are polluted with 24 banned pesticides and hundreds of chemicals.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Researchers tested samples from 29 waterways in 10 European countries, including two in the UK. Every single river and canal was found to contain multiple pesticides.\xc2\xa0
In addition, the study discovered evidence of 21 veterinary drugs. Thirteen waterways held concentrations of at least one chemical that exceeded European safety limits.\xc2\xa0

Samples were taken from two UK waterways, the rivers Otter (pictured) and Tale, both in Devon.\xc2\xa0Researchers tested samples from 29 waterways in 10 European countries, including two in the UK. Every single river and canal was found to contain multiple pesticides
A total of 24 pesticides that are not licensed for use in the European Union were detected.\xc2\xa0
And 70 different pesticides were identified in one Belgian canal with the highest level of contamination.\xc2\xa0
Dr Jorge Casado, from Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter, said: \'There is huge uncertainty about what effects these mixtures of chemicals could have on wildlife and human health.\xc2\xa0
\'We know many of these individual pesticides are a cause for concern.\'\xc2\xa0
The fact that unlicensed pesticides were found in the waterways does not necessarily mean they were used illegally, the researchers pointed out.\xc2\xa0
They could have been used lawfully before the bans came into force. Several pesticides were discovered in multiple rivers.\xc2\xa0
The fungicide chemical carbendazim, which is banned in the EU, was detected in 93 per cent of samples - a finding the study authors described as \'remarkable\'.\xc2\xa0
Of the 103 pesticides identified, almost half were herbicides and the rest were fungicides or insecticides.\xc2\xa0
A study discovered evidence of 21 veterinary drugs. Thirteen waterways held concentrations of at least one chemical that exceeded European safety limits (stock)
Most of the veterinary drugs that found their way into rivers and canals were antibiotics, said the researchers writing in the journal Science of the Total Environment.\xc2\xa0
Co-author Dr Paul Johnston, also from the University of Exeter, said: \'This is not a case of us versus farmers or water companies.\xc2\xa0
\'Farmers don\'t want to pollute rivers, and water companies don\'t want to have to remove all that pollution again downstream, so we have to work to reduce reliance on pesticides and veterinary drugs through more sustainable agriculture.\'\xc2\xa0
Samples were taken from two UK waterways, the rivers Otter and Tale, both in Devon.\xc2\xa0
Pesticide concentration in the Tale increased dramatically from 54.6 nanograms per litre (ng L) to 179.5 ng L between March 7 and July 2, 2018.\xc2\xa0
This coincided with a big increase in rainfall between the two dates.\xc2\xa0

BERLIN, April 10 (Reuters) - The German Defence Ministry estimates it will cost nearly 9 billion euros to keep its ageing fleet of 93 Tornado fighter jets flying until 2030, according to a classified document provided to German lawmakers this week.
The steep cost forecast includes 5.64 billion euros to maintain the warplanes, which first entered service in 1983, 1.62 billion euros to design replacements for obsolete parts, and 1.58 billion euros to procure them, according to the document, which was viewed by Reuters.
Germany in January decided to pick either the Eurofighter or Boeing Co\'s F/A-18E/F fighter jet to replace its Tornado fleet in coming years, dropping Lockheed Martin\'s F-35 stealth fighter from a tender worth billions of euros. .
But neither the F/A-18 nor the Eurofighter, built by Airbus, Britain\'s BAE Systems and Italy\'s Leonardo SpA , are currently certified to carry U.S. nuclear weapons, as required under Germany\'s obligations to NATO.
That means Germany will be dependent on its Tornado fleet until it gets new certified planes - a process that could take years.
The estimate came in response to a query by lawmakers from the opposition Free Democrats, who have criticised the ministry for dropping the F-35 - the only aircraft already certified.
The ministry did not specify the cost of operating the Tornado fleet until 2035, the current target, despite a specific request to do so from the lawmakers, and said it could adjust the retirement schedule.
Parliamentary sources said the estimate was even higher than expected at around 100 million euros per plane, and it would be cheaper to purchase new aircraft.
However Germany\'s sluggish defence procurement process, and the complicated process of certifying new aircraft to carry nuclear weapons, meant any new warplanes were unlikely to enter service until 2025 or even later.
Of Germany\'s 93 Tornado jets, 85 are operated by the Luftwaffe, or air force, but not all are equipped to carry nuclear weapons. The remaining planes are used for training.
The current Tornado fleet has a combat readiness rate of under 40 percent, according to sources familiar with new ministry data. Germany in past years had published such data, but this year made the readiness of its weapons a classified matter for security reasons.

A baby boy has died after suffering a fall at his home in rural Ireland.
The 15-month-old was pronounced dead shortly after the incident in Clonroche, near New Ross, in County Wexford on Tuesday afternoon.
It is thought the youngster - named as Shea Joyce by local station South East Radio - fell down some stairs.
The 15-month-old was pronounced dead shortly after the incident in Clonroche, near New Ross, in County Wexford on Tuesday afternoon
The toddler was discovered unresponsive at the foot of the staircase in his family home, and despite help from a local doctor died shortly after.
Garda\xc3\xad rushed to the scene but quickly established that the death did not appear to be suspicious.
New Ross Fianna F\xc3\xa1il councillor John Fleming said residents were rallying around the heartbroken parents, who have three older children.
He told The Irish Mirror: \'There is a dark cloud over the whole area.
\'They live in a cul-de-sac there and there\'s a lot of good neighbours, good friends and relations on the road and they\'ll rally around them at this time.
\'It\'s a hugely tragic accident and the whole area is in absolute shock.\'
The councillor added that the family are well-known and liked in the area.
A garda\xc3\xad spokeswoman said: \'Gardai in Wexford are investigating the sudden death of an infant male who was pronounced dead at Wexford Hospital yesterday afternoon after being brought from Clonroche.
\'Gardai are preparing a file for the coroner. The death is not believed to be suspicious. No further details are available.\'

Slump: German factory orders were 8.4 per cent lower in February than they had been a year earlier
German manufacturers have been hit by a huge slump in orders, prompting fears Europe\'s largest economy faces a major downturn.
Factory orders were 8.4 per cent lower in February than they had been a year earlier \xe2\x80\x93 which experts described as \'devastating\'.
The results prompted comparisons with the financial crisis in 2008, and sparked fears the European Central Bank may have to act to prevent a full-blown recession.
Carsten Brzeski of Dutch bank ING said: \'The negative reading is that the German industry should prepare for more bad news.\'
Pantheon Macroeconomics\'s Claus Visten said the figures are \'terrible \xe2\x80\x93 a mini-review of the horror show in 2008\'.
And Naeem Aslam of Think Markets said that the ECB might have to respond with more money-printing or higher interest rates.
Meanwhile, Germany\'s economic institutes cut their joint forecasts for growth this year from 1.9 per cent to just 0.8 per cent.
Oliver Holtemoeller, an economist who was involved in the decision, said: \'The long-term upswing of the German economy has come to an end.\'


European leaders are poised to grant Theresa May a longer extension to Britain\xe2\x80\x99s membership of the EU than she will request at a crunch summit in Brussels on Wednesday evening.
The Prime Minister is set to repeat her call to delay Brexit until June 30, with the possibility of an earlier departure if the UK\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal deal is ratified.
But European Council president Donald Tusk suggested on the eve of the summit that EU leaders grant the UK a longer extension of up to one year.
Mr Tusk, in a letter to the heads of the 27 remaining member states, said there was \xe2\x80\x9clittle reason to believe\xe2\x80\x9d that the ratification of Mrs May\xe2\x80\x99s beleaguered Brexit deal could be completed by the end of June.
He called for the European Council to discuss an alternative, longer extension, such as a \xe2\x80\x9cflexible extension\xe2\x80\x9d lasting \xe2\x80\x9cas long as necessary and no longer than one year\xe2\x80\x9d.
Mr Tusk wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cThe flexibility would allow to terminate the extension automatically, as soon as both sides have ratified the Withdrawal Agreement.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe UK would be free to leave whenever it is ready. And the EU27 would avoid repeated Brexit summits.
\xe2\x80\x9cImportantly, a long extension would provide more certainty and predictability by removing the threat of constantly shifting cliff-edge dates.
There are times when you need to give time time.
My letter to EU leaders ahead of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s #EUCO: https://t.co/bAsz4Qx36s#Brexit \xe2\x80\x94 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) April 9, 2019
\xe2\x80\x9cFurthermore, in the event of a continued stalemate, such a longer extension would allow the UK to rethink its Brexit strategy.\xe2\x80\x9d
Mr Tusk also warned that \xe2\x80\x9cneither side should be allowed to feel humiliated at any stage in this difficult process\xe2\x80\x9d.
It follows Mrs May\xe2\x80\x99s whistle-stop tour on Tuesday of European capitals for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin.
DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds branded the talks \xe2\x80\x9chumiliating and embarrassing\xe2\x80\x9d for the UK, and claimed Britain was \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively holding out a begging bowl to European leaders\xe2\x80\x9d.
The unanimous agreement of all 27 remaining EU states is needed to avoid a no-deal Brexit on the scheduled date of Friday, April 12.
On Tuesday evening MPs approved a Government motion for Mrs May to seek an extension to June 30 by 420 votes to 110, majority 310.
However, 97 Conservatives rebelled by opposing the plan \xe2\x80\x93 including former Brexit secretaries David Davis and Dominic Raab.
Mrs May will face the Commons for Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s Questions on Wednesday afternoon before she heads to Brussels where she is expected to meet Mr Tusk ahead of the summit.
EU leaders will then gather for talks with European Parliament president Antonio Tajani, before hearing from Mrs May.
They will then meet for dinner without her to agree a response to the UK\xe2\x80\x99s extension request.
A press conference with Mrs May is likely to be held after the summit, and the PM is expected to update MPs on Thursday.
Meanwhile in Westminster, Labour claimed the Government had not yet made a \xe2\x80\x9cclear shift\xe2\x80\x9d in its position in cross-party talks designed to break the impasse. Discussions will resume on Thursday.


As the young Arsenal forward Reiss Nelson made the drive from the university town of Heidelberg, cutting through the sparse villages of Hoffenheim and pulling into his loan club\xe2\x80\x99s Zuzenhausen training complex, the sense of foreboding arrived.
\xe2\x80\x98You are surrounded by all these trees,\xe2\x80\x99 smiles the 19-year-old winger. \xe2\x80\x98I was just thinking \xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I going to?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0
It seems very small but it opens up into a beautiful modern place and you are kind of surprised. But then I got into the changing room. All the guys are speaking German and I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d
Young Arsenal forward Reiss Nelson has been making quite an impression on loan in Germany
In previous times, a young English player, so out of their comfort zone, may have scrambled for the fastest escape route.
Hoffenheim, after all, is far removed from the fast and furious pace of life in South London.
Nelson grew up in the maligned Aylesbury Estate made famous by Tony Blair\xe2\x80\x99s first speech as Prime Minister in 1997.\xc2\xa0
When Blair visited Aylesbury, the estate was the lightning rod for him to declare that the \xe2\x80\x98poorest people in our country have been forgotten\xe2\x80\x99. The ITV crime soap The Bill used it as a gritty shooting location. For Nelson, it was simply home.
The 19-year-old moved out of his comfort zone to get first team action with Hoffenheim
Nelson admits he was initially daunted and could not understand what his team-mates said
\xe2\x80\x98Where I come from, the estates are not so nice,\xe2\x80\x99 Nelson says. \xe2\x80\x98It is a bit gritty. On my estate, there are dangerous things happening.
\xe2\x80\x98But I had my ball with me and that made me feel safe. I just went out to play. Street football...That\xe2\x80\x99s where I developed my strength, mentality and ruthlessness.
\xe2\x80\x98I have an elder brother who adores me and pushed me on. He just said \xe2\x80\x9cGo out and play\xe2\x80\x9d. My family made big sacrifices but little gestures mean a lot. My sister took me to training when she was pregnant.\xc2\xa0
\'My brother-in-law skipped work to get me to training. Our family get us through. We\xe2\x80\x99d get the train, a bus and sometimes even walk to training. I\xe2\x80\x99m just so happy it\xe2\x80\x99s working out.\xe2\x80\x99
Nelson is part of an English cohort talent defined by courage, self-confidence and open minds.\xc2\xa0
Nelson remains close friends with Borussia Dortmund\xe2\x80\x99s Jadon Sancho, a product of their shared upbringing in Kennington and subsequent German adventures. The pair represented Southwark together as Under-11\xe2\x80\x99s in the London Youth Games.
Nelson signed a new long-term contract at Arsenal last summer and impressed on the club\xe2\x80\x99s pre-season tour of Singapore. In the search for first-team football, he plumped for a season in Germany and the results were initially explosive.\xc2\xa0
Nelson scored on his debut and struck six goals in his first seven Bundesliga appearances. His progress has since been hampered by injury but the club\xe2\x80\x99s director Alexander Rosen calls Nelson \xe2\x80\x98really incredible\xe2\x80\x99.
Gareth Southgate\'s assistant has made trips over to Germany specifically to see Nelson play
Nelson grew up playing with Jadon Sancho and is hoping to make a similarly big impression
\xe2\x80\x98The intensity has made me better,\xe2\x80\x99 Nelson says. \xe2\x80\x98On my debut, the ball went over the top and I just heard everyone shouting \xe2\x80\x98Weiter, weiter, weiter\xe2\x80\x99.. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what they were talking about! I realised it meant run, run, press, press. That\xe2\x80\x99s the intensity you want.
\xe2\x80\x98I went very deep to pick up the ball in our own half and I tried to turn. A defender clattered me. I was confused, dizzy, then the ball was bouncing. I went to chase it and another player kicked the ball straight in my face. I remember falling to the floor and I think the captain grabbed me and just threw me...I was thinking \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he doing?\xe2\x80\x9d Two minutes later, I scored so I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that!\xe2\x80\x99
Along with Sancho at Borussia Dortmund, Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s contribution has tightened the gaze of German clubs towards Premier League academies.\xc2\xa0
In turn, young English talent know the statistics. Players aged below 22 have enjoyed 71,208 minutes of top-flight football in Germany this season, compared to 47,600 in the Premier League.\xc2\xa0
At Hoffenheim, Nelson has benefited from the coaching of 31-year-old manager Julian Nagelsmann and the club\xe2\x80\x99s hi-tech innovations. These include scheduled sessions of gaming to improve cognitive reaction times and aeroplane pilot-style response drills. He lives in nearby Heidelberg, spending his time with visiting family members or bowling with his new team-mates.
\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not very good at bowling...but of course I have the bumpers down,\xe2\x80\x99 he grins.
Within the corridors of power at Arsenal, Nelson has long been touted as another pearl mined from the South London production line.
The youngster is seen as the next pearl mined from south London production line of talent
He trained alongside the Arsenal first-team at the age of fifteen under Arsene Wenger but the first overtures came from rivals Tottenham. A midnight battle ensued for the gifted eight-year-old.
Nelson says: \xe2\x80\x98My brother-in-law was a Tottenham fan. He introduced me to football and brought me to Tottenham. At the time I just wanted to play football so I would go anywhere to play.\xc2\xa0
\'I was there on trial for two weeks. I had a game, played well and then I got home that night and I had a lot of teams calling me. It was so late, and I had school the next morning, but at 12 o\xe2\x80\x99clock Arsenal called and I went directly in the morning to the training ground.\xc2\xa0
\'Arsenal was my dream club, so I would have been kicking myself if I turned that down. I had Thierry Henry\xe2\x80\x99s name on the back of my shirts. Then he was the coach of our under-19 squad. His main thing was staying grounded.\xc2\xa0
\'A lot of kids, when they get to 18 or 19, they start getting flashy and forgetting about the real basics of being a professional footballer. He has always said \xe2\x80\x9cBe on that and you\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the top\xe2\x80\x9d.
Nelson grew up an Arsenal supporter and had no hesitation when the club wanted to take him
Henry\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in Nelson is shared by the England set-up. Manager Gareth Southgate has highlighted Nelson as another forward likely to break into the senior set-up. Earlier this season, Southgate\xe2\x80\x99s assistant Steve Holland paid a personal visit to Nelson in Hoffenheim.
The interest clearly meant much to the young winger. \xe2\x80\x98He came to the training ground. We showed him round and he watched the game. He said I\xe2\x80\x99ve just got to keep performing, and hopefully I can get there in the end. Every young kid dreams to play for their country.
\xe2\x80\x98I am just at the beginning. I want to get to the very top. My family deserve everything they will get.\xc2\xa0
\'For them to see me now in an Arsenal shirt and a Hoffenheim shirt, scoring my first goal here, they were literally in tears. It can only get better. I just need to stay loyal to God and anything can happen.\xe2\x80\x99


Phil Neville wants to see clubs like Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea \'throw open\' their stadiums for women\'s matches.
The England Women boss feels that with free tickets for such games huge crowds could attend, and has declared: \'Let\'s blow away the rest of Europe.\'
On March 17 there was a crowd of 60,739 at the Wanda Metropolitano for Atletico Madrid against Barcelona, a world record attendance for a women\'s club match.
Atletico\'s game in January against Athletic Bilbao at San Mames had a crowd of 48,121, and on March 24 there were 39,000 present at the Allianz Stadium as Juventus Women took on Fiorentina.
A crowd of 2,800 watched\xc2\xa0Chelsea beat West Ham in the Women\'s Super League on Sunday
But Neville, whose side face Canada at Manchester City\'s Academy Stadium on Friday in the first of four home \'Road to France Series\' warm-up matches ahead of this summer\'s World Cup, said: \'Looking at the attendances in our league yesterday, I actually think that\'s better than the one-off games in Spain or Italy.
\'There was 2,800 at Kingsmeadow (where Chelsea beat West Ham in the Women\'s Super League), 1,500 at Solihull (where Birmingham lost to Arsenal). I think we\'ve got a good foundation.
\'I see games in Spain where there\'s probably only 100 to 150 people watching. So I think as a base line, we\'ve got probably a little bit more sustainability.
\'What I would say is that some of the big teams in England now have got to open their big stadiums and fill it, and let\'s say \'let\'s blow the rest of Europe away\' because I think our game in this country is at a far better place than what it is in Spain and Italy.
Phil Neville wants clubs like Manchester United to \'throw open\' their stadiums for matches
\'I think now, if (second-tier leaders) Man United win the league, or (top-flight leaders) Arsenal - throw open your stadium, open it up.
\'Champions League game for Chelsea - why not play it at Stamford Bridge? Get 30 or 40,000.
\'I think my players are at the level now where our big clubs have got to open their stadiums and let\'s fill it and let\'s blow away the rest of Europe.
\'That\'s my feeling having watched Bilbao, Juventus. They\'ve done it, but let\'s us do it maybe two or three times from now to the end of the season.\'
Neville was then asked if he would advocate following those overseas games by having free tickets, and said: \'Why not?
Neville\'s England\xc2\xa0face Canada at Manchester City\'s Academy Stadium on Friday night
\'Man United let people in for free when they play at Leigh, so why can\'t you at Old Trafford? Why can\'t we fill Stamford Bridge for a Champions League semi-final against Lyon? It would be incredible.\'
Chelsea Women\'s Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris St Germain at the Stade Jean Bouin had an attendance of over 13,000 and flares were thrown from the stands during the contest.
Ahead of the first leg at Kingsmeadow a coach containing about 50 PSG supporters was turned away from the ground after weapons, fireworks and drugs were found.
Neville said: \'When I went to the Chelsea home game against PSG, even the little bit of kerfuffle before it showed me the women\'s game is going places.
\'I know it wasn\'t a nice thing, but you know, that little thing - \'actually this is important now\'.
\'The atmosphere in Paris where they\'re throwing things on the pitch, it\'s not nice and I don\'t like it but actually it shows we\'re catching people up.
\'We don\'t want any of the rubbish but what I\'m saying is it is a sign people aren\'t turning up for a women\'s game now just to sample the chips and bring the kids, they\'re actually coming because they want their team to win badly.
\'On Friday when we\'ve got 8-9,000 at Man City and 15,000 at Swindon (England face Spain at the County Ground next Tuesday), that will be something probably 70 per cent of my squad haven\'t played in front of and that\'s why I\'m excited about these games.\'

BERLIN (AP) - A group of 14 European scientific institutions plan to retrieve the world\'s oldest ice as part of research into past climate change.
The consortium led by the Germany-based Alfred Wegener Institute said Tuesday it has identified an area in Antarctica, nicknamed "Little Dome C," that should harbor ice as old as 1.5 million years.
So-called ice core measurements are crucial for scientists\' understanding of past climatic changes on Earth and the models they use to predict future global warming or cooling.
Current ice core measurements provide reliable data going back only about 800,000 years.
At a meeting in Vienna, the institutes said they spent the past three years working with American, Australian, Japanese and Russian colleagues using radar to determine the best possible site for drilling.


ROME, April 5 (Reuters) - Italy plans to gradually reduce individual income tax rates from five to two and to set a company tax rate at 20 percent, according to a draft National Reform Programme seen by Reuters.
The government will set the tax rates at 15 and 20 percent for all tax-payers, with the lower rate reserved for incomes of below 30,000 euros ($33,648.00) per year.
There are currently five tax rates, ranging from 23 percent to 43 percent.
The tax reform will potentially drive up Italy\'s budget deficit unless it is compensated by cuts to public spending.
The company tax rate (IRES), which is currently at 24 percent, will decline to 20 percent.
The National Reform Programme is part of a forecasting document (DEF), which European Union member States must send every April to Brussels. Italy is due to present its DEF, which will set the framework for the 2020 budget, on April 9.
The National Reform Programme also pledges to create a national bank for investments backed by a state guarantee. ($1 = 0.8916 euros) (Reporting by Giuseppe Fonte; writing by Angelo Amante)


Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has admitted that he cannot guarantee his social network won\'t be used to influence the outcome of the European elections.\xc2\xa0
Mr Zuckerberg, who spoke in Ireland after visiting the social network\'s European headquarters, said Facebook has taken steps to protect the democratic process since Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election in the US.
But he described the situation as an \'ongoing arms race\' pitting \'sophisticated nation states\' against technology giants, meaning a final solution will likely never be found.

Mark Zuckerberg described the fight against election meddling by foreign governments as an \'arms race\' and admitted a final solution might never be found (file image)
Speaking to Irish broadcaster RTE, he said: \'We\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly made a lot of progress in building defences to protect the integrity of elections.
\'But no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone can guarantee in a world where you have nation states [that] are trying to interfere in elections there is no single thing that we can do, and say okay, we have now solved the issue.
\'This is an ongoing arms race.\'
The European elections are due to take at the end of May when more than 700 positions in the European Parliament will be voted on by 27 member states.
Voters in the United Kingdom are not expected to take part as the country was supposed to have left the European Union by the time the election starts.\xc2\xa0
Mr Zuckerberg also qualified comments he made weeks ago calling for governments to take a greater role in regulating social media, denying that he had been trying to shirk responsibility for the issue.
Instead, he said that people want governments to be taking the lead over private companies or individuals like himself.
\'I think these days a lot of people don\xe2\x80\x99t want tech companies or any private companies to be making so many decisions about what speech is acceptable and what this harmful content that needs to be gets taken down,\' he said.
\'So I think there is a role for a broader public debate here and I think some of these things would benefit from a more democratic process and a more active government role.\'
Mr Zuckerberg spoke out after travelling to Facebook\'s EU headquarters in Dublin Tuesday to discuss with politicians how best to regulate the social network\xc2\xa0
It comes after Mr Zuckerberg met with\xc2\xa0politicians\xc2\xa0Hildegarde Naughton, James Lawless and Eamon Ryan to discuss what could be done to regulate social media.\xc2\xa0
The three members of the International Grand Committee on Disinformation and Fake News described the Facebook boss as \'quiet, unassuming, pleasant and smart.\'
Former British deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, now serving as Facebook\'s head of global affairs and communications, was also at the meeting.
Mr Zuckerberg told the politicians that issues around child protection and age verification are of \'huge concern\' to him.\xc2\xa0
Ms Naughton described the meeting as \'positive and constructive\'.
\'We went through a number of issues including child protection and the need for a robust age verification system,\' she said.
The three members of the International Grand Committee on Disinformation and Fake News described the Facebook boss as \'quiet, unassuming, pleasant and smart\'
\'He said it was an area of huge concern to him and that he is looking forward to working with law enforcement agencies and legislators in relation to that. We have to balance the state of privacy of users as well as safety.
\'He stated he had a lot more work to do.
\'Our committee is working on a number of pieces of legislation including an online safety commissioner as well as looking at and protecting democracy.
\'I mentioned the importance around age verification because you have right now paedophiles online lying about their age and preying on young children and grooming them.
\'This is something he acknowledged, he knew it was a problem and he stated that he wanted to work with law enforcement agencies and policy makers to make more robust laws.\'\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
The TDs held an hour-long meeting with him days after he called for increased government oversight of the internet in areas like harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.
Mr Lawless said: \'Our focus was also on electoral integrity and what has been happening around the world on the rules in managing election campaigns.
\'He agreed legislation is needed, he is working on those internationally to be able to see who is running campaigns, who is paying for campaigns and who is being targeted.
\'It shouldn\'t be about the private companies dictating what goes online when it comes to democracy and child protection and safety, we as legislators have responsibilities to put in place rules that we think should be followed and dictating to companies about how behaviours are conducted online.\'

Nick Clegg, the former leader of the British Liberal Democrats, accompanied Mr Zuckerberg in his new role as head of global affairs
Mr Ryan said: \'I pressed him about the article he wrote on regulation and I made the point that it can\'t be self-regulation it has to be European regulation and that has to include funding journalism and having a courts procedure rather than a self-appointed board to look at difficult decisions.\'\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Mr Zuckerberg also visited the technology giant\'s European Headquarters as part of his visit to the Republic.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
But he refused to answer questions from the media about online child safety as he left the Merrion Hotel.\xc2\xa0
The International Grand Committee on Disinformation and Fake News is made up of international parliamentarians and investigates issues like data privacy, safety, security and sharing.
The three TDs, who are also members of the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, have been vocal in demanding the regulation of social media platforms in recent years.
Ireland\'s Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon has a number of inquiries ongoing into Facebook and associated organisations.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
According to the Irish Times Mr Zuckerberg praised Europe\'s introduction of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which tightened up rules regarding data privacy.
The social network founder said GDPR was a good foundation that encoded a lot of important values around people being able to choose how their data is used, and at the same time making sure that companies have the ability to use information for safety purposes.
He added that it was almost inevitable that every country was going to want comprehensive privacy legislation.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0

FRANKFURT, April 4 (Reuters) - Bidding has accelerated again in Germany\'s auction of frequencies for next-generation 5G mobile networks, reducing chances that the four companies taking part will bag spectrum at bargain prices.
Action had slowed to a trickle this week with new bids in each auction round dwindling to just a few million euros, fuelling speculation the auction could end up being Germany\'s cheapest ever.
The auction is being held in an old army barracks, with teams sequestered in separate rooms submitting offers via a secure network. The process, which can run for weeks, ends only when there are no new bids.
Bidding picked up again on Wednesday afternoon with Deutsche Telekom ending the day in a dominant position. As of Thursday morning, the total amount pledged was 2.9 billion euros ($3.3 billion).
Germany is auctioning 41 blocks of spectrum in the 2 gigahertz and 3.6 GHz bands. Analyst Usman Ghazi at Berenberg Bank had forecast that, in a benign scenario for operators, proceeds could total around 3 billion euros.
His base-case scenario sees 4-5 billion euros in proceeds, while a worst-case outcome would be upward of 8 billion euros - roughly in line with a costly 5G auction in Italy last year that has put operators\' finances under pressure.
New entrant 1&1 Drillisch had been bidding up the cost of spectrum in the 2 GHz band - which is more suited to running 4G services - to levels that Ghazi called irrational.
Drillisch, run by billionaire Ralph Dommermuth, had been on the ropes earlier in the process, with dibs on just one spectrum block, but came back in Round 97 with a massive bid to signal the seriousness of its intent.
Analysts note that Telefonica Deutschland, the market No.3 by revenues, has been passive in the 2 GHz band and speculate that it may have a reserve of existing adjacent spectrum to draw on for its network.
Bids are lower for spectrum in the 3.6 GHz band, which has higher data-carrying capacity and is suited to 5G applications such as running networked "smart" factories.
As of Round 126 https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/_tools/FrequenzXml/Auktion2019_XML/126.html, Deutsche Telekom was leading in 12 blocks, Vodafone in 11, Drillisch in 10, and Telefonica Deutschland in just two. Bids had been withdrawn on the other six blocks.
Germany\'s 4G spectrum auction in 2015 ended after raising 5.1 billion euros. A previous auction in 2010 went on for six weeks and ended after 224 rounds of bidding. ($1 = 0.8894 euros)

BERLIN (AP) - Former U.S. President Barack Obama says he wants to support young leaders in Europe and elsewhere who are trying to tackle problems such as climate change and inequality.
Obama told a town hall meeting in Berlin on Saturday that mentoring activists through his foundation may help encourage "millions of people who are working on the values and causes that we so deeply believe in."
He said despite Europe\'s wealth, social achievements and decades of peace, "we also know that powerful forces are working to reverse many of these trends."
The former president offered activists advice on a range of topics, from capitalism to mindfulness.
Obama suggested that fostering reasoned debate online should be a key task to keep politics from going in a negative direction.

BERLIN (AP) - A court Germany has sentenced a 44-year-old Iranian man to life in prison for stabbing to death a woman on a street in the western city of Duesseldorf last year.
German news agency dpa reported Thursday that the Duesseldorf regional court earlier found Ali .S, whose full name wasn\'t released for privacy reasons, guilty of murder.
The suspect, who was arrested in Spain, had stalked the 36-year-old woman. She had rejected his advances, whereupon he stabbed her 27 times in July 2018.


Democratic 2020 hopeful Beto O\'Rourke launched a stinging attack on Donald Trump yesterday in which he compared the President\'s administration to Nazi Germany.
In an explosive intervention, the former congressman accused the White House\'s immigration rhetoric of being strikingly similar to the language used during Hitler\'s Third Reich.\xc2\xa0
The Texan, who narrowly lost the state\'s tight Senate race, hit out at the President\'s labeling of migrants as \'animals and an infestation\'.

\'Now, I might expect someone to describe another human being as an infestation in the Third Reich.
\'I would not expect that in the United States of America.\'\xc2\xa0
He added: \'Seeking to ban all Muslims, all people of one religion, what other country on the face of the planet does that kind of thing?\xc2\xa0
\'Or in our human history? Or in the history of the western world?\xc2\xa0Because they are somehow deficient or violent or a threat to us?\'

PARIS, April 8 (Reuters) - Europe needs to decide on a digital tax and should lead the way if there is insufficient consensus globally, the EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, said on Monday.
There is still disagreement among EU members over how to implement a so-called "GAFA tax" - named after Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon - to ensure the global internet giants pay a fair share of taxes on their massive business operations in Europe.
France has been driving hard for such a tax, but at a meeting of EU finance meetings over the weekend, Sweden, Finland, Ireland and Denmark blocked a draft EU-wide GAFA tax proposal, officials said.
"We are becoming an increasingly digital world and it will be a huge problem if we do not find a way to raise (digital) taxes," Vestager told France Inter radio.
Vestager, who is widely talked about as a candidate for the European Commission presidency when Jean-Claude Juncker\'s term expires in November, said European countries first needed a deal which could lead to a EU-wide harmonised tax.
"The best thing is a global solution. But if we want to obtain results in a reasonable period of time, Europe must take the lead," the commissioner added.
Lawmakers in France\'s National Assembly, France\'s lower house of Parliament, will on Monday begin debating a draft national GAFA tax law. The bill proposes a 3 percent tax on digital advertising and other revenues of tech firms with worldwide revenues of more than 750 million euros ($842 million).
Vestager, a former Danish economy minister, has a high profile in Brussels for attacking tax avoidance and monopoly powers among U.S. multinationals, and is seen as a contender to be the next Commission president.
She hasn\xc2\xb4t announced a public bid for the job, but if she does she would likely need the backing of French President Emmanuel Macron.
Asked if she was interested in the Commission presidency, she said: "I take a lot of interest in the future of Europe. My point is that before we decide on any kind of new face for the Commission, we really need to know what we want to do."
Internet giants are coming under increasing pressure from regulators globally. Separately on Monday, Britain proposed new online safety laws that would slap penalties on social media companies and technology firms if they fail to protect their users from harmful content.

Scotland\xe2\x80\x99s Brexit Secretary has insisted holding European elections is essential for the UK, as he warned staging a second referendum could take up to eight months to organise.
Mike Russell stressed the need for UK\xc2\xa0ministers to seek a \xe2\x80\x9cvery long extension\xe2\x80\x9d to the Brexit process.
As it stands, the UK is due to leave the EU on April 12, with no deal yet in place.
Prime Minister Theresa May is meeting Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for a second round of talks in a bid to resolve the impasse which has resulted from the Commons\xe2\x80\x99 repeated rejection of her Withdrawal Agreement.
But for progress to be achieved, Mr Russell said the PM would have to \xe2\x80\x9cmove from the bunker\xe2\x80\x9d and accept some form of compromise.
Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland\xe2\x80\x99s Good Morning Scotland programme on Thursday, Mr Russell said: \xe2\x80\x9cJeremy Corbyn said last night he was surprised that the Prime Minister hadn\xe2\x80\x99t given more, I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised. I think anybody with experience of the Prime Minister knows that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give, she just sits there and takes.
\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the big issue, is she prepared to move from the bunker in which she has established herself over many months and move forward?
\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no signs that she is, but equally those discussions will have to continue.
\xe2\x80\x9cShe has kept the clock ticking in a very dangerous way. This is her responsibility.
\xe2\x80\x9cSo there is a responsibility to try to find some way forward before the cliff-edge of a no-deal Brexit which is now essentially a week away.\xe2\x80\x9d
With the UK\xe2\x80\x99s exit date \xe2\x80\x93 which has already been delayed from the original March 29 deadline \xe2\x80\x93 looming, Mr Russell revealed he had written to Mrs May\xe2\x80\x99s defacto deputy, David Lidington, to argue the case for the UK taking part in May\xe2\x80\x99s European Parliament elections.
He said: \xe2\x80\x9cYesterday I wrote to David Lidington to say I thought those elections were now essential and have to be held.\xe2\x80\x9d
Prime Minister Theresa May has been holding talks with Labour aimed at finding a way forward on Brexit (PA)
Mr Russell argued that \xe2\x80\x9cany solution\xe2\x80\x9d to the Brexit impasse had to have a People\xe2\x80\x99s Vote \xe2\x80\x9cat the heart of it\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 noting that politicians at Westminster had failed to resolve matters.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe people have to be asked what they think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.
But he stressed \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t rush a referenda\xe2\x80\x9d, insisting best practice would have to be followed for such a vote.
He said: \xe2\x80\x9cClearly this is a matter of six to eight months, I would have thought, that also implies a very long delay and sensible people are arguing for that very long delay and for European elections.\xe2\x80\x9d
That could have knock-on implications for a possible second Scottish independence referendum \xe2\x80\x93 with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon set to make clear her thinking on this only when there is more clarity over Brexit.
Mr Russell accepted: \xe2\x80\x9cQuite clearly clarity on the Brexit process is required.\xe2\x80\x9d
But he also said: \xe2\x80\x9cEqually I have to say that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the people of Scotland should have to suffer the chaos and confusion and economic and other destruction that is taking place at the present moment.\xe2\x80\x9d


Between 1955-56 and 2002-03, there was one meeting of English clubs in the European Cup and Champions League. Nottingham Forest and Liverpool in 1978-79.
Later the format changed, allowing multiple entries from the same competition. On Tuesday, when Tottenham play Manchester City it will be the 12th all Premier League tie in 16 seasons.
As Tottenham are in a new stadium, Manchester City are on for an unprecedented Quadruple and the teams haven\'t met in Europe before, it is still exciting - but give it a few years and the dead hand of Andrea Agnelli and see how you feel.\xc2\xa0
Juventus president Andrea Agnelli and other club owners want to reshape European football
By the time the inheritor of Juventus is finished, the Champions League will be as moribund as \xe2\x80\x94 well, Serie A, or the Bundesliga, or any of the domestic competitions controlled by the men who now presume to reshape European football, having ruined their own.
Juventus are winning their league by 20 points and are on course for an eighth straight title.\xc2\xa0
Meanwhile, the most mediocre Bayern Munich side in recent memory have just beaten their main rivals, Borussia Dortmund, 5-0 to reclaim their place at the top of the league in Germany. Stay there, and it will be their seventh straight win.
Having greedily crushed all opposition, these clubs wonder why their markets are shrinking.
So Agnelli has an idea - and this shows how dim he is. He wants to turn the greatest club competition in the world into the International Champions Cup. He wants to limit surprise, limit the new, limit all of the uncertainty that makes sport compelling.
Juventus are winning their league by 20 points and are on course for an eighth straight title
Who won the International Champions Cup last summer? Who cares? It\'s an invitational, a gathering of the world\'s wealthiest, hawking their wares around the globe under the pretence of competition.\xc2\xa0
In 2016, Manchester United and Manchester City did not even complete their fixture schedules and nothing happened. Why would it?
It doesn\'t matter whether this tournament finishes or not. Everyone comes back next year just the same because entry is for the richest, not the best.\xc2\xa0
AC Milan have featured in every edition since the first in 2013, a period in which the club has finished eighth, 10th, seventh, sixth and sixth.
This is what Agnelli wants for the Champions League. Not excellence, not brilliance: the right to be rubbish. He wants to take qualification away from league position and root it in history.
He wants endless repeats of the same uninspiring fixtures, because he imagines a global audience that knows no better and will lap it up.\xc2\xa0
Most of all, he wants to strip the Premier League of everything that makes it good. He thinks our owners are as stupid as he is; long-term, who knows, he may be right.
Not all invitationals are without worth. The Masters is an invitational \xe2\x80\x94 to win it earns a lifelong invite \xe2\x80\x94 but one that equally acknowledges current form.\xc2\xa0
Agnelli\'s plans would prioritise history for likes of AC Milan \xe2\x80\x93 the past would trump the present
The top 50 in the world are always present, as are those qualifying for the season-end Tour Championship. High finishers in the other major tournaments and leading amateurs are also acknowledged.
Agnelli\'s plans would prioritise history. The past would trump the present, the old would flourish over the new.
Not all of his ideas are ruinous. His proposed format would simply make European competitions duller, not irrelevant.\xc2\xa0
Four groups of eight instead of eight groups of four will involve many more fixtures fans can afford to miss, more dead rubbers and dead ends, but ultimately a recognisable competition should still emerge.
His scheme to link qualification to historic, not current, success however is the end of the Champions League as a prestige competition.\xc2\xa0
Once Leicester can pull off the greatest achievement in the history of English football and it ceases to matter in Europe, the Champions League is dead.
Once an elite club can finish sixth without consequence, the domestic league is done, too. The league must be relevant. Success there must afford entry to Europe. Abandon that principle and the entire campaign is worthless. Why watch, if we know the outcome?
This season\'s Premier League title race is compelling, but so is the fight for two Champions League places between four clubs. Tottenham, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United are separated by a handful of points.
Yet what if we already knew Manchester United and Chelsea were through, due to their status as past winners? Then the drama is dead.\xc2\xa0
If Leicester winning the league ceases to matter in Europe, the Champions League is dead
As is fifth-placed Atalanta\'s battle with the Milan clubs in Italy, and Getafe\'s fairy tale in Spain, and the resurgence of Eintracht Frankfurt in Germany \xe2\x80\x94 a club without a top-four finish in 26 years.\xc2\xa0
At Wembley on Sunday, the supporters of Wolverhampton Wanderers and Watford made for the most inspiring noise the new stadium has heard.
Are we to tell those fans that, soon, there will be a red rope across the door, and only those who were good decades ago will be allowed through.
That is Agnelli\'s intention: the endless recycling of matches between the self-styled elite, mediocre Milan versus average Arsenal, with other, deserving match-ups ignored.\xc2\xa0
The all-English games still carry excitement, but Liverpool have met Chelsea five times in the Champions League since 2005.
If they had played again this year it would not have carried the same excitement \xe2\x80\x94 just as Liverpool against Porto is rather underwhelming given their mismatch a year ago.\xc2\xa0
Imagine then, if it didn\'t even matter who won \xe2\x80\x94 if the same round of fixtures were destined to be rerun, regardless of quality, regardless of competitive balance, regardless of merit.
That is Agnelli\'s proposal. Maybe it comes from inherited wealth. A person feels entitled. To everything.

Walker was stupid \xe2\x80\x93 no butts\xc2\xa0
Anyone who has ever seen or, heaven forbid, felt a headbutt properly delivered will know the difference between that and what Kyle Walker did to Alireza Jahanbakhsh of Brighton at Wembley on Saturday.\xc2\xa0
Walker was aggressive, and certainly foolish given the potential consequences, but there is a butt and there is contact that happens when two men square up.
Anthony Taylor and the VAR call were correct. It was a yellow card and anything more would have been disproportionate given the reality of the offence. We need to stop making needless drama.

I swear, foul-mouthed Costa had to go\xc2\xa0
Referee Gil Manzano has revealed the phrase that got Diego Costa sent off after 28 minutes of Atletico Madrid\'s match with Barcelona. According to the official report, Costa told him: \'I s*** on your whore mother.\'
This reminded of waiting for Mark Dennis in the car park at The Dell after one of his many dismissals for Southampton in the Eighties. On this occasion, it was for dissent.\xc2\xa0
He stopped and we asked exactly what had happened. Dennis recalled a contentious offside going against him.
\'I turned to the ref,\' he explained, \'and I said to him, "You f****** stupid c***, you f****** blind t***".\'
He paused for a moment of reflection. \'Course I had to go, didn\'t I?\' One hopes Costa is blessed with similar insight.

We must come clean about the tragic cost of racing\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0
As the field sped towards the second at Aintree, the death throes of Up For Review could clearly be seen.\xc2\xa0
Brought down at the first, he was thrashing around on the turf in the distance, unable to rise.\xc2\xa0No context was offered in the commentary. No mention beyond the news of a couple of fallers.
On the second circuit, we were told the runners were bypassing the first fence, but not why. It took a small degree of knowledge to notice the bleak green screens in the corner of the picture, and imagine what was unfolding behind them, and no one was about to let the two-quid-each-way viewers in on that horrific detail.\xc2\xa0
When ITV later re-showed the race, the coverage started from the second fence, again without proper explanation.
Yet if national hunt racing is so easily defensible, why the secrecy? Why not tell people what they are seeing? Why sanitise events for the home audience?
It does not matter whether you love the sport, deplore it, or are just feeling increasingly uncomfortable \xe2\x80\x94 there were three equine deaths at the Aintree meeting, and the same number at Cheltenham \xe2\x80\x94 we should at least be honest about consequences.\xc2\xa0Then, unlike tragic Up For Review, we can make up our own minds on participation.

If you build it, they still won\'t come
Nikita Parris introduced a welcome dose of realism into what might be termed the Field of Dreams stage of women\'s football in England.
The call for club matches to be moved to huge arenas, despite average attendances of 937 in the Women\'s Super League, belongs very much to the fantasy world of Kevin Costner\'s cornfield baseball diamond bringing forth the ghosts of the 1919 Chicago White Sox baseball team.
\'If you build it, they will come,\' Costner\'s character, Ray Kinsella, is told \xe2\x80\x94 which is a nice line for a film, but doesn\'t help sell out stadiums, when average gates are actually down by 16.9 per cent from two years ago.
Phil Neville was among those encouraging clubs to move women\'s games to their main stadiums, citing the 60,739 that watched a women\'s match between Atletico Madrid and Barcelona recently. Yet more than half the crowd got in free and massive emphasis was placed on promoting a set-piece event.
Atletico Madrid Femenino have played at home to Real Betis at their 3,865 capacity stadium since, and the attendance was 613. Giving away a product free does not translate to increased interest.
Parris, who plays for Manchester City, seems alone in advocating organic growth. \'Let\'s build women\'s football from the bottom before we get to the top,\' she said.\xc2\xa0\'We can talk about the Etihad and Manchester United\'s ground in a few years\' time. Let\'s fill the academy Stadiums and the Kingsmeadows, first of all.\'
Kingsmeadow is where Chelsea Women play. It has a capacity of 4,850 and the most recent match, against West Ham, drew a crowd of 2,854 \xe2\x80\x94 very good for a WSL game and better than the average attendance at five League Two clubs, but roughly 39,000 under what Stamford Bridge holds.
So what purpose is served taking Chelsea Women to an echoing, empty bowl? They might get a spike for a one-off outing, but beyond that?
It could be ruinous for a sport that is working hard to build a core audience. That is where the future for women\'s football lies: not in the fantasy of novelties and gimmicks.

Tottenham have not beaten Manchester City since leaving White Hart Lane. So, if they win on Tuesday, it will say something for the power of the new arena.\xc2\xa0
\'Everybody talks about the stadium like it\'s special,\' sniffed Kevin De Bruyne. \'Everybody has a stadium. The stadium doesn\'t matter.\'
It mattered at this stage of the competition last year, mind you, when City seemed to freeze faced with the challenge of Anfield on a European night.\xc2\xa0
Might 17,500 fans in the impressive Park Lane end similarly embolden Tottenham? Certainly, this is a greater test of home advantage than last week\'s victory over unambitious Crystal Palace.
Tottenham are playing a team that are their superiors by 16 points over 32 games this season. If they can turn that form around, it would suggest there is inspiration in their new home.\xc2\xa0
If they cannot, perhaps De Bruyne is right and having the best stadium won\'t matter until the best team also plays there.

Gordon Strachan was known for his acerbic quips. Some were funny, but they were also easy. Reporters tie themselves in knots trying to be polite after matches. Instead of asking the brutal \'why did you lose?\' an interviewer will try to couch it in gentler terms: \'In what areas were the opposition better than you today?\'
Strachan\'s sarcastic response to that one: \'Mainly the big green one out there\' is amusing, but unenlightening.\xc2\xa0
\'You don\'t take losing lightly, do you?\' said one hapless questioner after a defeat, affecting sympathy. Strachan\'s reply \xe2\x80\x94 \'I don\'t take stupid questions lightly, either\' \xe2\x80\x94 made no acknowledgement of this.
Yes, it was a stupid question, but would he prefer the blunt version? Managers don\'t seem to like that, either. Anyway, as Strachan now knows, there is a difference between a one-liner and the weighty analysis the modern game demands.
Sports discussion programmes are like the Andrew Marr show. Sexism, racism, executive pay, gambling, the rehabilitation of offenders, brain injuries, employee welfare, divisions in society, high finance, complex international law, the moral maze \xe2\x80\x94 be prepared to discuss it all, and without verbal missteps.\xc2\xa0Strachan thought the folks with the microphones had it easy. Now he knows.


MILAN, April 5 (Reuters) - Italy\'s Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Friday there were investors ready to get involved in a rescue plan for troubled flagship carrier Alitalia.
"Partners are there", Di Maio said on the sideline of an event in Milan.
A deadline for Ferrovie dello Stato to present a rescue plan for Alitalia has been extended by one month to end-April after the Italian railway group, which is in talks with Delta Air Lines over Alitalia, failed to present a business plan for the carrier in time.

HALFWEG, Netherlands, April 2 (Reuters) - Ford is already spending tens of millions of euros to prepare for the possibility Britain could leave the European Union without a trade deal in place, Ford Europe chairman Steven Armstrong said on Tuesday.
Ford, which makes engines in Britain and cars in Germany, has warned it could face $1 billion in tariff costs in case of a hard Brexit.
In an interview at an event in the Netherlands, Armstrong told Reuters the company was already spending tens of millions on euros on measures such as currency hedges and shifting inventory between countries. He said the best case scenario was that the money spent preparing for Brexit would be "wasted". (Reporting by Toby Sterling. Editing by Jane Merriman)


A Lithuanian man enjoyed airborne bliss as he boarded a hulking Boeing 737 to find he was the only passenger.\xc2\xa0
Skirmantas Strimaitis, who was flying from Vilnius in Lithuania to Bergamo in Italy for a skiing holiday on March 16, had the whole 188-seater plane to himself.
No screaming infants or selfish seat recliners to contend with on his two hour flight, but just the\xc2\xa0two pilots and five cabin crew to take care of his every need.

The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold.
But only one lucky passenger had bought one.
Mr Strimaitis said on Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was \'a once in the lifetime experience.\'
He shared selfies from his flight where he was seen beaming from ear-to-ear as he settled in to enjoy the spacious, peaceful ride.\xc2\xa0
In July last year, 28-year-old\xc2\xa0Saad Jilani was able to experience similar luxury when he was the only passenger aboard a flight from Corfu, Greece, to Birmingham, England.
He praised the Jet2Airways staff as \'amazing\' and said they were \'very excited\' to give him the rare experience as he returned from a friend\'s wedding in Greece.
Mr Jilani said it was the best flight of his life and it ended with the pilot announcing: \'The eagle has landed.\'\xc2\xa0

More than 400 people gathered on cliffs near Brighton to send an SOS signal across the English Channel in protest against Brexit.
The protesters used mirrors and other reflective objects to send the signal in the direction of continental Europe.
The stunt was a \xe2\x80\x9clarge scale, pro-EU, human artwork\xe2\x80\x9d, according to a statement issued by the organiser, Bristol-based artist Dunkan McKellar.
The stunt was a "symbolic" protest over Brexit, according to the organiser. (duncanmckellarsunshine on Instagram/PA)
\xe2\x80\x9cThe group successfully created a symbolic SOS call to the rest of Europe, to show the strength of the British pro-EU community in the face of Brexit chaos,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement added.
The protest took place on Saturday on the cliffs at Saltdean on the south coast.
The crowd spread out to form a long line along the coast, facing out across the sea.

BRUSSELS, April 8 (Reuters) - The European Union\'s data protection supervisor said on Monday it is investigating whether products provided by software giant Microsoft to EU institutions comply with its new data protection rules.
In November the Dutch government raised concerns in a report about the collection of data done through Microsoft ProPlus, which includes popular software such as Microsoft Word writing software and Microsoft Outlook email.
"Any EU institutions using the Microsoft applications investigated in this report are likely to face similar issues to those encountered by national public authorities," the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) said in a statement.
EDPS said it suspected that institutions using Microsoft Office ProPlus software might face "increased risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals."
It said it would check which Microsoft applications are used by EU institutions. Its investigation will look into whether the contractual arrangements between the U.S. company and EU institutions to process personal data are "fully compliant" with the new General Data Protection Rules (GDPR) that came into force last year.
EU institutions, such as the European Commission and the European Parliament, rely on Microsoft services and products to carry out their daily activities, the supervisor said. (Reporting by Francesco Guarascio Editing by Alissa de Carbonnel and Susan Fenton)


ROME (AP) - The Italian news agency ANSA is reporting that another infant boy has died in Italy as the result of a circumcision performed at home.
ANSA reported the newborn died overnight near the port city of Genoa after his Nigerian mother and grandmother called for emergency medical help.
A 5-month-old baby died last month in Bologna after his parents performed a circumcision at home, and a 2-year-old boy died of severe blood loss as a result of a botched circumcision in Rome last December.
Circumcision is not practiced among Italy\'s Roman Catholic majority. Many immigrants in Italy are Muslim and practice circumcision for cultural and religious reasons, but sometimes have trouble accessing the practice in hospitals either for cost or because some doctors refuse to perform circumcisions until boys are at least 4.


Business activity in Northern Ireland has dropped for the first time in almost three years, with Brexit uncertainty blamed for the decline.
The Purchasing Managers\xe2\x80\x99 Index, a well-established benchmarked index for measuring private sector growth, has recorded a decrease in activity for the first time since July 2016.
Rates of employment and new orders in the sector are also on a downward trajectory, the data from the Ulster Bank Northern Ireland PMI.
Richard Ramsey, chief economist with Ulster Bank Northern Ireland, said the region\xe2\x80\x99s firms were becoming increasingly pessimistic about what lies ahead in 2019.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe term Brexit Uncertainty has been overused in the last couple of years, however it is again a major feature of the latest PMI, with the impact of this becoming more and more tangible,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.

\xe2\x80\x9cBusiness conditions deteriorated further according to respondents, with March seeing the first fall in business activity in 32-months.
\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps more significantly though, export orders and employment levels both dropped at their fastest rate in almost six years, and Northern Ireland firms are increasingly pessimistic about the year ahead.
\xe2\x80\x9cClearly the potential for a no-deal scenario was exercising the minds of business owners last month.
\xe2\x80\x9cPositives were in short supply in the latest survey with manufacturing continuing to be the only sector recording output growth; albeit that stockpiling was no doubt a factor.
\xe2\x80\x9cThis is seen in the UK Manufacturing PMI, where stockpiling was reported to be rising at its fastest rate in 27 years.
\xe2\x80\x9cAt the other end of the spectrum locally is retail, with sales activity declining at its sharpest rate in four years.
\xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile, Northern Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s largest sector, the service industry, took a turn for the worse in March, with output, orders and employment all going lower.
\xe2\x80\x9cService sector activity hit a 32-month low and staffing levels in the sector are falling at the fastest rate in almost six and a half years.
\xe2\x80\x9cLast month marked the end of the first quarter of the year, and the deteriorating picture in March meant that it was the weakest quarter in terms of output since Q3 2016.
\xe2\x80\x9cMore significantly though, employment and exports had their worst quarter since the first half of 2013.\xe2\x80\x9d
Mr Ramsey said the UK as a whole was struggling on the growth front.
\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed this picture is consistent in Europe as well, where Germany for instance, is seeing manufacturing activity falling at a rapid rate,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.
\xe2\x80\x9cNorthern Ireland, though, differs from the rest of the UK in that there has been a lack of decision-making on two fronts, with the absence of an Executive adding to the complications created by uncertainty over Brexit.
\xe2\x80\x9cThis has driven a declining picture regarding confidence, with Northern Ireland respondents, particularly in the construction sector, the most pessimistic in the UK regarding future output.
\xe2\x80\x9cWith the prospect of a no-deal Brexit receding and decisions in relation to some key infrastructure projects now being made in Northern Ireland, it remains to be seen whether some optimism returns in the months ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d
The March PMI report was produced for Ulster Bank by IHS Markit.


BERLIN (AP) - German authorities have indicted a Sri Lankan man suspected of involvement in killing 15 captured government soldiers while fighting for the Tamil Tigers rebel group.
Federal prosecutors said Friday that 37-year-old Sivatheeban B. is accused of membership in a foreign terrorist organization, war crimes, two cases of manslaughter and 11 cases of attempted manslaughter.
The man, whose surname wasn\'t released due to German privacy rules, was arrested in August.
Prosecutors allege that in 2008 the suspect guarded 15 captured soldiers as they were driven to a site where they were executed, and later helped burn their bodies. In a separate incident a year later, he fired on 13 soldiers, two of whom died.
The rebel group, which fought for a separate state for ethnic minority Tamils, was defeated in 2009.


WASHINGTON, April 10 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that the State Department was looking closely at Qatar Airways\' acquisition of a 49 percent stake in Air Italy.
Questioned repeatedly about the deal during a U.S. Senate hearing, Pompeo said, "We\'re looking very closely at this recent decision by Qatar to take on 49 percent of this airline."
Both Republicans and Democrats at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing said they were concerned that the deal with the Italian carrier violated an agreement Qatar Airways\' reached with the United States in early 2018.

MOSCOW, April 12 (Reuters) - European refiners are paying the price for U.S. oil sanctions on Venezuela and Iran as they scramble to replace the sour crude Washington has blocked from the global market with increasingly expensive Russian oil, trading sources said and data showed.
Compounding the impact of sanctions, OPEC members have mainly cut sour crude output as part of their deal with allied producers to boost oil prices while a large, new refinery, designed to run on sour oil, has just started up in Turkey.
U.S. output is soaring and exports are set to jump later this year as new infrastructure comes online but it is not an alternative, being mainly light and sweet.
As a result, European refiners have been left competing to secure as much medium, sour Russian Urals as they can, pushing the differential of that oil to levels not seen since 2013.
"Urals is anchored in a positive zone versus dated Brent and there is no indication it will fall to a discount any time soon," a trading source at a European oil major said.
In the Mediterranean, the differential for Urals typically trades at a discount of at least a dollar to benchmark dated Brent but since early November, the level has spiked and now stands at a premium of 70 cents a barrel.
For a 600,000-barrel cargo of Urals, that rise translates to an extra $1.35 million cost.
Thanks to the higher premiums, Russia made an additional $140 million in March from seaborne and pipeline deliveries versus October prior to the sanctions coming into effect.
Initially, Europeans gravitated to heavy, sour Venezuelan oil when sanctions on Iran hit in early November but then Washington also placed sanctions on the Latin American country in late January in a bid to oust President Nicolas Maduro.
Even though sanctions on Venezuelan crude will not come into effect until the end of April, the oil is effectively already untouchable as the U.S. State Department has exerted direct pressure on foreign companies to stop all dealings.
The two sets of sanctions combined have taken at least 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) out of the market, which is as much as what the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cut.
The United States granted waivers on Iranian oil to six jurisdictions including three countries in the region - Italy, Greece and Turkey - but only Turkey was able to continue purchases. It remains unclear whether the current waivers will be extended in May.
THE SOUR RUSH
The situation is set to worsen as European refiners emerge from their springtime maintenance just as Middle Eastern Gulf sour crude producers increasingly favour Asia, where refining capacity in the near term is set to jump.
Saudi Arabia, a major sour crude producer, is shouldering the bulk of the OPEC and non-OPEC cuts. Between October 2018 and March this year, the kingdom slashed its exports to Europe by nearly half, Refinitiv Eikon data shows.
Iraq reduced its contracted volumes for European refiners in 2019 and increasingly sells its oil to the highest bidder via tender.
Iraqi supplies to Europe fell by over 40 percent to 355,000 bpd in March compared with 615,000 bpd in October 2018, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.
Meanwhile, Azerbaijan\'s 200,000-bpd STAR refinery in Turkey is slowly ramping up and will be a new competitor for dwindling sour oil.
Designed to run on sour grades such as Russian Urals and Iraqi Basra and Kirkuk, the refinery took 184,000 bpd of Urals in March, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.
"One expected STAR\'s launch to be a serious jolt for the market, but little did we know it would make the sour shortage this bad ... refiners are rushing for sours," a European trader said.
As the supply-side structure has changed, the spread between sour and the historically far more expensive light, sweet crude has thinned and even flipped in some instances.
In the Mediterranean, the light grade Kazakh CPC Blend trades at a discount to Urals and Kurdish crude, which used to be one of the region\'s cheapest oils.
The Urals price out of the Black Sea has also increasingly traded at a premium to Urals out of Baltic ports - previously a rare occurrence. The trend has prompted commodity price-reporting agency S&P Global Platts to start an industry consultation on changing how the Urals market is assessed.
"All refiners are looking for Urals or a Urals replacement," said a third trader in an international trading firm.
"And we see that it won\'t be enough for everyone."

European football\'s crackdown against racist behaviour by supporters has continued with punishments for Croatian champions GNK Dinamo and Ukraine\'s Dynamo Kiev.
Last week, UEFA ordered Italy\'s Lazio, Ukrainian champions Shakhtar Donetsk and Czech side Slavia Prague to play their next home European ties in front of partially closed stadiums following racist chanting and other crowd disturbances in recent Europa League matches.
And on Monday, UEFA\'s control, ethics and disciplinary body ruled that GNK Dinamo\'s next two home games in European competition should take place behind closed doors, with the second of those games deferred for two years, while Dynamo Kiev were given the lesser sanction of a partial closure.
UEFA have handed out stadium punishments to both GNK Dinamo (pictured) and Dynamo Kiev
GNK Dinamo\'s next two home games in Europe will take place behind closed doors, UEFA ruled
GNK Dinamo\'s offences took place during the first leg of the last-16 game against Benfica last month and they were also fined \xc2\xa340,000 for their fans setting off fireworks, throwing objects and blocking stairways, with a further \xc2\xa317,000 levied for the racism.
Dynamo Kiev were also charged with a range of offences, including racist behaviour, following their last-32 game against Olympiakos in February but, as this was a first offence, they were treated more leniently.
The Ukrainians came through that tie but were then soundly beaten by Chelsea in the last 16, although the Premier League side were also sanctioned by UEFA on Monday for the behaviour of their fans in their last-32 game against Malmo in Sweden on February 14.
Dynamo Kiev were also charged with a range of offences, including racist behaviour from fans
As this was a first offence, Dynamo Kiev were treated more leniently with only a partial closure
The Blues were given a \xc2\xa311,000 fine for their fans throwing objects and invading the pitch, while their hosts were hit with a \xc2\xa349,000 fine because their supporters also threw objects and set off fireworks.
Monday\'s punishments for racist behaviour come a week after several England players were racially abused by Montenegro fans during their Euro 2020 qualifier in Podgorica and on the eve of a two-day anti-discrimination conference at Wembley co-hosted by UEFA, the Football Association and European campaign group Fare Network.

Western Europe\xe2\x80\x99s tallest building is set to be erected in the tiny rural town of Brande in Denmark, which has a population of just 7,000 people.
The skyscraper will be the headquarters of fashion giant Bestseller, which was founded in the town in 1975, and at 320 metres (1,049 feet) will be ten metres taller than London\xe2\x80\x99s Shard. An eye-popping rendering shows how the building will dominate the flat countryside around it \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99ll be visible from around 60km (37 miles) away.\xc2\xa0
Bestseller says it\'ll become a landmark, though perhaps not in a good way. It\'s been compared to The Tower of Sauron in Lord of the Rings.
The skyscraper will be the headquarters of fashion giant Bestseller and at 320 metres (1,049 feet), will be ten metres taller than London\xe2\x80\x99s Shard
Bestseller - which is owned by Anders Holch Povlsen, Denmark\xe2\x80\x99s richest man - calls the plan the Tower & Village project, and says that it is a \xe2\x80\x98rethink\xe2\x80\x99 of the classic idea of a headquarters
The tongue-in-cheek comparison was made by a Danish satirical publication called Rokokoposten, according to The Guardian, which wrote a spoof article in which Sauron was quoted as saying: \xe2\x80\x98I have offered to finance a major interactive art installation in the form of a blazing eye at the very top of the building.\xe2\x80\x99
The Guardian says that there are also serious objections to the project.
It quotes Aarhus architect Trine Kammer as saying that the building will destroy \xe2\x80\x98undisturbed landscape\xe2\x80\x99.
The project has, nevertheless, received approval from the city council and one local reporter from Brande told The Guardian: \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to find anyone here who is opposed to the tower.\xe2\x80\x99
The complex will become home to 30 stores, educational facilities, hotel accommodation and multiple Bestseller offices

The complex, designed by architect firm Dorte Mandrup, will become home to 30 stores, educational facilities, hotel accommodation and multiple Bestseller offices.
Hans Ulbrichsen, from Brande Trade Association, said: \xe2\x80\x98We see Bestseller\xe2\x80\x99s project plan as a great opportunity for the town. An opportunity that can help create a dynamic life in all of Brande \xe2\x80\x93 not just for Bestseller \xe2\x80\x93 but very much also for the local businesses in Brande. A larger customer base is beneficial for all parties.
\xe2\x80\x98The overall building project is thought as an investment in Brande, and the planned high-rise building will function as an icon for the new expansion. It will be a landmark that places Brande on the map, but it will also function as an architectural attraction benefitting hotel guests, students and other users of the building.\xe2\x80\x99
Project Manager Anders Krogh said: \xe2\x80\x98We are very pleased that the plans have now been approved by the city council and we are extremely proud and humbled by the amount of support our project has received, especially locally. It is important for us to underline that the city council\xe2\x80\x99s approval is merely one of the preliminary steps of a long journey.
\xe2\x80\x98The city council\xe2\x80\x99s approval is obviously essential, but we still have a lot of homework to do and much to consider before a project like this can be brought to life. We still have years ahead of us before a potential start date.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0

MILAN, April 4 (Reuters) - Three investors including Italian fashion entrepreneur Renzo Rosso are eyeing a possible bid for luxury label Roberto Cavalli, according to a document filed by the company with a court in Milan as it seeks breathing space from creditors.
The fashion company on Monday filed a request with a bankruptcy court for 120 days of protection from creditors to reach an agreement on its debt and find a new investor, after it struggled to reboot sales and faced a cash crunch.
Cavalli, a red carpet favourite famed for its animal prints, has been 90 percent owned by private equity firm Clessidra since 2015, and the group attempted to overhaul the label including with a new manager and designer.
But it has posted a string of losses since 2014, with the exception of 2015, when it was back in profit after the sale of a property in Paris.
Clessidra hired Rothschild in September to find a new investor to provide the group "with the needed resources to overcome the difficult situation and to relaunch the business", and it also subscribed to a 15 million euro ($17 million) capital increase in 2018, the document seen by Reuters showed.
But the private equity investor rejected a request by Cavalli\'s board in March this year to pump another 47 million euros into the company, the court filing said.
According to a source close to the situation, the fund through which Clessidra owns Cavalli has reached its statutory limit of investment.
Out of 80 potential investors contacted by Rothschild, three expressed interest in buying the company as a whole, the document revealed.
Bluestar, a U.S. holding company which owns fashion brand Bebe, revised its initial offer but expressed "its willingness to evaluate an acquisition of the business within the framework of a debt restructuring agreement".
Diesel-owner OTB, the group run by Renzo Rosso which had initially denied an interest, also offered to invest in Cavalli together with current shareholders and said it was "available to proceed with a deal as part of creditor procedure".
German fashion designer Philipp Plein, who has his own brand, could be interested in pursuing takeover negotiations but only after an accord with creditors is reached, the document showed.
Cavalli is liquidating its U.S. unit and closed its stores there this week.

MILAN (AP) - EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Tuesday that he is "slightly concerned" over Italy\'s slowing economy, and expressed hope that the government would take action to accelerate growth.
"Italian authorities must make supplementary efforts to keep growth alive in Italy," Juncker said at a joint press conference with Premier Giuseppe Conte.
Juncker noted that when the EU approved Italy\'s controversial budget expanding social spending, the commission projected Italian growth at 1.2 percent for 2019.
Italy has since fallen into a technical recession, and various bodies have lowered growth estimates for the year, including Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which says Italy\'s economy is likely to contract 0.2 percent this year.
In its report this week, the OECD called for bold reforms to tackle low productivity as well as social and regional inequalities.
The OECD was especially critical of the basic income scheme backed by the 5-Star Movement, saying it risks weakening work incentives and creating poverty traps given the relatively high payments compared with similar schemes in other member states.

Conte said that his government this week would approve a decree "with measures that will give impulse to growth."
But he also said that the slowdown was expected, "and that is why we conceived of a budget that wants to follow expansive but responsible policies, approving measures that the country needed for too long to re-establish social equality."

A sharp rise in inflation will be most keenly felt in Northern Ireland, retailers have said.
Discretionary weekly income is just over half the UK average, and food prices are at their highest level in more than five years.
Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: \xe2\x80\x9cRetailers are working hard to keep down shop prices; however, cost pressures in the supply chain have built up and are being compounded by increases in government-imposed taxes.
Northern Ireland Retail Consortium director Aodhan Connolly (Rebecca Black/PA)
\xe2\x80\x9cThese pressures are now outweighing the impact of strong competition between shopkeepers, who have little margin to work with, and who are regrettably being forced to pass on some of these costs to consumers.
\xe2\x80\x9cWith Northern Ireland households having half of the discretionary income of households in Britain, this inflation will be felt and most keenly felt by lower income households who typically spend proportionally more of their family budget on groceries.\xe2\x80\x9d
Northern Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s average discretionary weekly income is \xc2\xa3109 but the UK average is \xc2\xa3207 and in London it is \xc2\xa3282.
The latest UK-wide Shop Price Index of the 500 most commonly bought products shows prices at shop tills nudged up again in March, to a six-year high.
Shop price inflation accelerated to 0.9%, up from 0.7% in February \xe2\x80\x93 the highest inflation rate since March 2013, the index showed.
Non-food prices were at the same level as March 2018. In February, they were 0.2% higher than the previous year.
Food inflation accelerated in March to 2.5%, up from 1.6% in February, the highest inflation\xc2\xa0rate since November 2013.
Global commodity prices and weather events pushed food prices up, with an increase in global cereal prices seeing bread and cereal costs rise.
Last year\xe2\x80\x99s bad weather meant several UK crops, like onions,\xc2\xa0potatoes, and cabbage, saw much lower yields, and, as a result, these products are seeing now significant price increases.


LOS ANGELES (AP) - A new professional league for elite swimmers will debut this year with U.S. and foreign teams competing in a mixed gender format with the athletes being paid.
Five-time Olympic champion Katie Ledecky will compete for one of the International Swimming League\'s eight teams - four based in the U.S. and four in Europe.
Ledecky said the league "represents a new era for professional swimming."
"Especially for competitive women like me," she said Tuesday. "Jumping in the pool for the ISL really means a new era for women since it\'s one of the first leagues to emphasize gender equality as one of its values."
Besides Ledecky, fellow Americans Nathan Adrian, Simone Manuel and Ryan Murphy have been tabbed as ambassadors. They\'re expected to both compete and help promote the inaugural season.
The ISL won\'t begin until after this summer\'s world championships in South Korea, while a planned 2020 season would start after the Tokyo Olympics.

Founded by Ukrainian financier Konstantin Grigorishin, the league will launch Oct. 4-5, with meets held nearly every weekend through Nov. 24. The league championship will be in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay in a temporary pool on Dec. 20-21. The racing will be in short-course meters rather than the long-course format used in the Olympics.
"The show that is going to go around it will be quite a production, very fan-oriented," former Olympic medalist Kaitlin Sandeno said.
The U.S. will be represented by: the New York Breakers, the Los Angeles Current, the DC Trident, and the Cali Condors based in San Francisco.
The Breakers will be overseen by general manager Tina Andrew, mother and manager of swimmer Michael Andrew. The Current will be led by retired Olympic backstroke champion Lenny Krayzelburg, the Condors by retired four-time Olympic champion Jason Lezak, and the Trident by Sandeno.
The European teams will be based in London, Rome, Budapest and likely France.
Full rosters will be announced in the coming weeks.
Swimmers will compete for team points in various styles of races, with 12 men and 12 women on each team. The ISL said numerous Olympic champions and world record holders will participate.
"There\'s something about competing for a team title," five-time Olympic champion Adrian said. "It\'s a different kind of energy than what swimmers are used to."
The ISL will have a zero tolerance doping policy and won\'t allow any swimmer with a previous doping violation to participate.
Swimmers will sign two contracts: one with their team and another with the ISL. Revenue will flow from the clubs and the league to the athletes. Grigorishin said revenue will be split 50-50 between the league and swimmers.
"We have one of the hardest working athletes in the sports world and they deserve more than we have gotten so far," Krayzelburg said. "It\'s going to change the landscape, create more exposure and opportunities for our athletes and put the sport of swimming on the forefront, not just in the Olympic year."
Currently, professional swimmers have the TYR Pro Swim Series in the U.S. and the FINA World Cup between August and November in Europe, Asia and the Middle East in which they compete for prize money.
The ISL has overcome roadblocks to its formation, having filed a federal antitrust lawsuit last year against FINA, the sport\'s international governing body.
FINA announced its own Champions Swim Series made up of invitation-only meets in Guangzhou, Budapest and Indianapolis in April and May. Total prize money is $3.9 million and the competitions will include some of the sport\'s biggest names.
"We have no principle conflict with FINA," Grigorishin said. "FINA should be responsible for the whole swimming world. The league is just for the elite swimmers. Somebody has to regulate and set up the rules in swimming. If you are a regulator, you should not be organizer of competition. In the future, FINA will have to make a choice."
Grigorishin said negotiations with global broadcasting outlets are ongoing.


BERLIN (AP) - A court Germany has sentenced a 44-year-old Iranian man to life in prison for stabbing to death a woman on a street in the western city of Duesseldorf last year.
German news agency dpa reported Thursday that the Duesseldorf regional court earlier found Ali .S, whose full name wasn\'t released for privacy reasons, guilty of murder.
The suspect, who was arrested in Spain, had stalked the 36-year-old woman. She had rejected his advances, whereupon he stabbed her 27 times in July 2018.

TOKYO, April 8 (Reuters) - Japanese investors look set to switch some money from European bonds to U.S. debt, hoping for capital gains after the U.S. bond yield curve recently flashed signs of recession down the road.
While the jury is still out on whether the United States will have a recession, such fears were enough to sink bond yields to zero percent in Germany and Japan, which face possible ones sooner than the world\'s biggest economy does.
That has made the United States. the only major market where investors can expect further falls in bond yields, and hence gains in prices, market players say.
"Concerns about a U.S. recession are rising among investors we communicate with," said Hiroshi Yokotani, portfolio strategist at State Street Global Advisors. "The U.S. could slip into a recession or the Fed may try to stop it by cutting interest rates. Either way, bond yields should fall."
Yokotani sees a shift to U.S. bonds from European ones, as "investors are looking to capital gains as they expect yields to fall".
For years, Japanese investors have sought refuge in foreign bonds, effectively kicked out of their domestic bond market by the Bank of Japan\'s ownership of nearly half of it. Japanese are among the biggest players in the United States and Europe.
In 2018, European bonds were their favourite as German Bund yields rose to as high as 0.80 percent and French yields above 1.0 percent at one point.
On the other hand, U.S. bonds were shunned despite their higher yields, as the cost of currency hedging, closely tied with dollar short-term interest rates, increased as the U.S. Federal Reserve kept raising rates.
But the picture has changed as the spectre of a U.S. recession added to growth concerns in Europe and Japan.
Germany narrowly skirted a recession at the end of last year while Japan\'s economy contracted in two of 2018\'s quarters and might have shrunk in January-March. (Data will be reported in May.)
But in contrast to the United States, where rate cuts are possible, neither the BOJ nor the European Central Bank have room to trim, with rates already below zero percent.
In July, the BOJ is thought to have tried to reduce the side-effects on banks and other interest earners from its negative policy rates by expanding its bond yield target range.
But the measure seems to have backfired as 10-year JGB yields fell to two-year lows as economic prospects darkened, making JGBs even more unattractive.
NOT MUCH UPSIDE
"We don\'t see much upside at all in being overweight JGBs. The yield is obviously incredibly low," said Ross Hutchison, global bond fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh.
The BOJ\'s preferred policy framework policy is "very unlikely to lead to further cuts certainly in our investment horizon of three to six months or maybe even longer than that", he added.
Against this backdrop, U.S. bonds with yields of around 2.5 percent seem a logical choice for investors worried the global growth could further slow.
For Japanese investors, as high currency hedge costs remain a drawback, higher-yielding corporate bonds and mortgage bonds are likely to be the main target for now, market players said.
Investors were spooked by last month\'s inversion in U.S. yields, when 10-year ones fell below 3-month rates. The phenomenon has been a highly reliable signal of coming recession over 50 years.
While the inversion later reversed, many investors want to stay in long-term U.S. bonds.
Global share prices have recovered but earnings have not improved. And if you look at why bond yields have fallen in the first place, all the reasons - low inflation, low growth potential, dovish central banks - are still there," said Akira Takei, fund manager at Asset Management One in Tokyo.

MILAN (AP) - A mayoral candidate in Italy says a cousin of hers was threatened on a public tram in Florence because of the color of his skin.
Antonella Bundu, who was born in Florence to parents from Sierra Leone, said in a Facebook post on Monday that "a fascist gang" accosted her cousin with both racial insults and death threats.
Bundu says other passengers in the rail car came to his defense.
She wrote the experience shook up her cousin "because if a fascist gang felt they could act in broad daylight, in public, that means that something isn\'t right, and that this climate of hatred must be stopped before it is too late."
The current mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, says police are reviewing video footage to try to identify the aggressors.


BERLIN (AP) - German prosecutors say they have indicted two Indian citizens for spying on the Sikh opposition and Kashmiri separatists in Germany.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that 50-year-old Manmohan S. is accused of providing information to India\'s foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, from January 2015 onward.
His wife, 51-year-old Kanwal Jit K., allegedly also began cooperating with the spy agency starting in July 2017. Their full names weren\'t released due to German privacy rules.
Prosecutors said the couple is accused of receiving a total of 7,200 euros (about $8,100) for the information they provided to their handler, who was stationed in Germany.


ROME (AP) - The Italian news agency ANSA is reporting that another infant boy has died in Italy as the result of a circumcision performed at home.
ANSA reported the newborn died overnight near the port city of Genoa after his Nigerian mother and grandmother called for emergency medical help.
A 5-month-old baby died last month in Bologna after his parents performed a circumcision at home, and a 2-year-old boy died of severe blood loss as a result of a botched circumcision in Rome last December.
Circumcision is not practiced among Italy\'s Roman Catholic majority. Many immigrants in Italy are Muslim and practice circumcision for cultural and religious reasons, but sometimes have trouble accessing the practice in hospitals either for cost or because some doctors refuse to perform circumcisions until boys are at least 4.

BRUSSELS, April 7 (Reuters) - Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini sends texts with smileys to French far-right leader Marine Le Pen and posts selfies with Austrian far-right politician Heinz-Christian Strache.
The face of the leader of Italy\'s far-right League party is beamed onto big screens at right-wing rallies from Prague to Sofia.
Buoyed by his own success and voter fatigue with mainstream parties, Salvini is trying to build bridges before elections on May 26 to the European Parliament, the European Union\'s legislature.
With the two biggest political blocs expected to lose their combined majority, he and other far-right leaders hope to form an opposition, eurosceptic alliance with enough seats in the assembly to block or hold up legislation.
"Our idea is to come together ... into a new party that better reflects the eurosceptical views that unite us," Salvini\'s foreign affairs advisor Marco Zanni told Reuters. "Now is our chance to unite forces once and for all."
But when Salvini starts his campaign for the elections on Monday in Milan, representatives of only three, relatively small far-right European parties will be present.
Le Pen will not be there. Nor will representatives of Jaroslaw Kaczynski\'s Law and Justice party (PiS), which governs Poland.
Salvini promises a much bigger rally next month. But the absence of Le Pen and other leading far-right and nationalist leaders speaks to the policy differences and rivalries that have long stood in the way of unity among such groups.
Far-right leaders share the broad ideological goals of curbing the EU\'s perceived liberal course and returning power to the member states\' capitals. But they differ in other areas, and an attempt by U.S. President Donald Trump\'s former strategist, Steve Bannon, to act as a power broker among Europe\'s populist groups has fizzled.
BIRDS OF A FEATHER?
Investors expect heightened political uncertainty after the May 26 election, in which 705 members of the European Parliament (MEPs) will be elected, or 751 if Britain fails to leave the EU as planned.
General dissatisfaction over slow economic growth, security threats posed by Islamist militants and a backlash against migration across open EU borders have boosted support for eurosceptic nationalists in many member states.
"There is a growing confidence of voters to go against the norm," said Susi Dennison, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. "The \'anti- forces\' are much more motivated right now than the pro-Europeans."
Their gains and Britain\'s planned departure from the EU will mean a shake-up of the pan-national groups created by parties in the EU parliament, whose main role is checking and amending EU laws drawn up by the executive European Commission.
Salvini\'s anti-immigrant League is forecast to more than quadruple its representation in the EU assembly with 27 seats.
Along with the projected rise for Le Pen\'s National Rally and Strache\'s Freedom Party of Austria, which is in a coalition government with Strache as vice-chancellor, the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) group to which they belong could be boosted to 61 seats from 37.
Salvini, whose party co-rules Italy, wants to embrace other leaders whose parties are in rival groups such as Kaczynski.
The two held a meeting in Warsaw in January, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban hailed the prospect of them forming an alliance as one of the greatest developments of this year.
Forming one big political group can also unlock funds and opportunities for patronage.
"They\'re going to get much more resources if they\'re able to sit together," said Cas Mudde, an expert on the far-right at the University of Georgia.
But policy differences make it likely that parties critical of the EU will remain divided into at least two groupings, one centred around Salvini and the other around Kaczynski.
Salvini admires Russian President Vladimir Putin - Kaczynski vilifies him. Both are anti-immigration but at odds over how to handle it. Italy is net giver to the EU budget, Poland is a net receiver. Their views on the economy do not align.
For right-wing parties in Denmark, Finland and Sweden which see Russia as a threat, Salvini and Le Pen\'s pro-Kremlin sympathies are also a red line.
"It is a crucial aspect for many countries," Sweden Democrat leader Jimmie Akesson told Reuters. "It will not succeed, there will be no such group."
Many parties competing at the national level will also find it difficult to sit together.
Orban has chosen to remain with the parliament\'s biggest political grouping despite being suspended from it last month. For all his praise of coalition-building among eurosceptics, being in a group with Europe\'s power brokers confers a mainstream respectability that other populists lack.
Some hope that will change after the election.
"Leaving a strong group to join a weak group is a difficult political decision, but leaving to join a group that is also quite strong and growing is less so," said Ryszard Legutko, a PiS lawmaker and co-chair of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group.
"It is the first time there\'s a real chance things might change, that this political, even ideological monopoly can be somehow undermined," Legutko said.
IN FROM THE COLD
Links among the far-right remain largely limited to personal relationships. When leaders who have long been isolated at home and lack influence abroad attend each other\'s rallies, it is about showing they are not marginal.
"It is about validating one another," said Duncan McDonnell, Professor of Politics in the School of Government and International Relations at Griffith University. But he said the far-right increasingly saw itself as "part of a new wave". The Alternative for Germany (AfD) could win many more seats in the next European Parliament, opinion polls show, and might throw its hat in with Salvini\'s ENF group. The polls show the Forum for Democracy (FvD) in the Netherlands, led by Thierry Baudet, could win four new seats in the EU assembly and it has said it will join Poland\'s PiS in the ECR.
Spanish newcomer Vox has become the darling of eurosceptic groups following its success in a regional election last December in Spain, which until then had been resistant to the populist currents sweeping Europe.
Vox is now being courted by both by Poland\'s PiS and Salvini\'s League. But looking ahead to the next European Parliament - where polls suggest Vox will win about five seats, up from none today -- Vox leader Santiago Abascal told Reuters: "It may be that we\'ll be alone."
Vox has capitalised on domestic tensions over Catalan separatism - it regards Catalonia as an integral part of Spain - but some other far-right parties do not share its view.
"Their support of the (separatists\') coup d\'etat by Catalonia is an enormous barrier (to cooperation)," he said.
Even if parties are not the same group, Zanni of Salvini\'s League says there will be greater cooperation to try to influence or thwart EU policy.
"The risk is longer-term paralysis," Dennison said, "that over time will erode the idea of EU as an effective actor."
But European Parliament strategists say younger right-wing political groups have shown far weaker party discipline.
"The eurosceptics are a wing of many feathers, and I\'m not sure it will beat effectively," said one senior official in the European People\'s Party, the main centre-right group.

A Belfast actor has paid tribute to a US TV giant\xc2\xa0for bringing its biggest show to the region.
Ian Beattie, who played the unpopular Ser Meryn Trant on the HBO drama Game Of Thrones, said the positive effect of the show on Northern Ireland is beyond calculation.
He described it as tremendous fun to play the villainous knight although conceded it became harder in later seasons where he was faced with scenes including one where he had to attack Sophie Turner\xe2\x80\x99s character Sansa Stark at the behest of King Joffrey.

\xe2\x80\x9cHe was probably the most unsuitable member of the Kingsguard ever, he was a thug, a coward, a bully and honestly he had no redeeming features whatsoever,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.
Beattie was faced with wearing a coat of armour for the role which he weighed as being 28kg.
\xe2\x80\x9cBut the lovely thing about it is the stunning detailing, and when you put it on, it really helped you with the character you were playing, you just became the character.\xe2\x80\x9d
Speaking to the Press Association at the launch of the Game Of Thrones touring exhibition at the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast,\xc2\xa0Beattie went on to pay tribute to HBO.
\xe2\x80\x9cGame Of Thrones has transformed so much in this province, we have so much to be grateful for, that HBO decided to bring this show here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a new tourist attraction, loads of them, our own beautiful coastline which plays host to many of the scenes in the TV show, the positive effect on our economy to have a major American TV series being filmed here, the training of our crews, our camera people in front of and behind the camera, our artisans, our plasterers, our painters, the hotel trade, everything.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe trickle down effect of Game Of Thrones has been incalculable.\xe2\x80\x9d


DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) - China\'s prime minister has promised that Beijing will respect European standards and fair trade, seeking to allay concerns that it\'s flouting EU competition rules with huge investments on the continent.
Opening an annual summit of Eastern and Central European nations and China, Li Keqiang said "we intend to fully respect European standards."
Beijing has also been criticized for failing to give reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
He adds "we welcome openness and we want to treat all companies that operate in China equally and to increase imports from the (European) countries."

LONDON, April 8 (Reuters) - The British government said on Monday it had taken the necessary steps required by law to participate in European Parliament elections in May, but that this did not mean it was inevitable Britain would take part.
Britain is due to leave the EU on Friday, but Prime Minister Theresa May has asked the EU for a further delay to Britain\'s exit date while she seeks to reach a compromise with the opposition Labour Party in order to get her Brexit deal passed.
"As a responsible government today we have taken the necessary steps required by law should we have to participate," a government spokesman said in a statement.
"It does not make these elections inevitable, as leaving the EU before the date of election automatically removes our obligation to take part." (Reporting by Kylie MacLellan and William James, editing by David Milliken)


Millions of Brits will be able to head to the Mediterranean for their summer holidays without needing a visa even if there is a No Deal Brexit.
Euro-MPs in Brussels today ruled that anyone travelling to the border-free main part of the EU for less than 90 days will not need the costly travel document.
This includes popular holiday destinations like Spain, Greece, Portugal, Italy, Malta and France which are visited by huge numbers of UK tourists every year.\xc2\xa0
Implementation will depend on Britain granting EU citizens the same rights in return, but London has said it will do so and the principle of the law has broad support.
The news is a welcome boost for British travellers after the EU yesterday made a swipe for home comfort foods like Cornish pasties and pork pies.
Ham, sausages and cheese are among products that could be barred from being taken to the continent if the UK leaves without a deal under hardcore disease control rules.
The European Parliament passed the new law governing British travellers in Europe by more than 400 votes in Brussels.\xc2\xa0
But the law giving Britons 90 days of visa-free travel to countries like Spain, France and Greece also referred to Gibraltar as a colony, despite British anger
A senior European Commissioner warned that luggage checks would come into force at all EU borders points immediately if the UK left without a deal at any time.
If the rules were heavily policed it could mean travellers either leaving their beloved comfort snacks behind or find a way of smuggling them past border guards.\xc2\xa0
\'You will have to pick and choose what you are bringing from the UK. Any animal based product you will not want to put into your luggage. No import of any ham, sausage or other delicacies. That\'s the end of that,\' a Brussels official told the Telegraph.
The visa law was passed by the European Parliament with a massive 502-81 but it is likely to spark some fury in Britain.
EU member states - at Spain\'s urging - referred in a footnote to the draft to Gibraltar as a "colony of the British crown".
The United Nations does legally list Gibraltar as a "non-self-governing territory", but Britain insists it is part of "the UK family" and that its citizens freely voted to remain British.
The reference upset the UK and held up the bill, which had already been approved by the European Commission.\xc2\xa0
Gibraltarians, whose economy depends on an open border with Spain, voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU in Britain\'s 2016 referendum.\xc2\xa0
Spain, which is holding national elections on April 28, sees Brexit as a chance to rally the rest of the EU behind its claim to the territory of 33,000 inhabitants.
It has already secured a right of veto over whether future Brexit arrangements can apply to Gibraltar once Britain has left the EU.


BERLIN (AP) - A court in Germany has found a 70-year-old babysitter guilty of manslaughter for the killing of a 7-year-old boy she was looking after.
Judges at the regional court in the southwestern city of Heilbronn sentenced the woman Monday to 10 years and six months in prison.
The trained nurse, who had been the boy\'s babysitter for several years and who he called "Grandma Elisabeth," had strangled the child while he was staying the night at her home.
Judges rejected the defense lawyer\'s arguments that his client, whose full name wasn\'t released because of German privacy rules, had killed the boy by accident, though they did take into consideration that she might have been suffering from depression and been overwhelmed by stress.

LONDON, April 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The Roma migrated to Europe from India in the 10th century and have long faced persecution around the world. Many live on the fringes of society and struggle for work.
On Roma Visibility day, here are 10 facts about Roma people.
1. Roma are Europe\'s largest ethnic minority, with up to 12 million living across the continent, most of them in Central and Eastern Europe.
2. About 80 percent of Roma in Europe live below the poverty line, according to a survey of 34,000 Roma people in nine EU member states in 2016.
3. Anti-Roma discrimination is widespread - one in four Roma said in 2016 they had experienced discrimination within the last year, but only about 10 percent reported it to authorities.
4. More than half of Europeans said they would not want to have "Gypsies" as neighbours in a 2008 study that found only drug addicts, heavy drinkers and people with a criminal record were seen as less desirable.
5. Roma generally have a life expectancy of 10 years less than the average European and a child mortality rate that is significantly higher than the EU average.
6. Fewer than one in four Roma people finish school and about 20 percent of Roma adults in Europe say they cannot read or write.
7. Only about one in four Roma adults in Europe are in work, with only 16 percent of women reporting they had a job in 2016 compared to a third of men.
8. Roma are known to be at high risk of statelessness, though there is a lack of clear data. In 2016 the United Nations reported that about 15,000 Roma children were at risk of statelessness in Italy alone.
9. Within Latin American, only Colombia and Brazil recognise Roma as an official minority group, meaning they have additional legal protections and rights.
10. Roma are at high risk of living in poor quality homes and authorities have carried out forced evacuations in Italy and Bulgaria in recent months.

Ryanair has become one of Europe\'s top ten polluters and the only company in that group not running coal-fired power plants.
Data from the European Commission shows that the airline is estimated to have pumped out 9.9 megatons of CO2 last year, the 10th worst.
Power plants - seven of which are German - form the rest of the line up, with the Belchatow plant in Poland takes the top spot, the second largest fossil-fuel power station on the planet, it spews an estimated 38.2 megatons of CO2.
But despite the Commission\'s evidence that Ryanair\'s emissions were up 6.9 percent, the airline\'s spokesman said: \'Ryanair is Europe\'s greenest and cleanest airline. Passengers travelling on Ryanair have the lowest CO2 emissions per km travelled than any other airline.\'
A Ryanair jet taking off from Leeds Bradford airport, the airline states they were \'Europe\'s greenest and cleanest airline\'
Europe\'s top ten polluters in megatons of CO2, with Ryanair coming in 10th and the rest being coal-fired power plants
Europe\'s Transport and Environment research group (T&E) outlined how airline emissions rose 4.9 percent last year and have risen some 26.3 percent in the last five years.
The Irish airline had figures for those periods of 6.9 percent and 49 percent respectively.\xc2\xa0
T&E\'s aviation manager Andrew Murphy said: \'When it comes to climate, Ryanair is the new coal.
\'This trend will only continue until Europe realises that this undertaxed and under-regulated sector needs to be brought into line, starting with a tax on kerosene and the introduction of mandates that force airlines to switch to zero-emission jet fuel.\'
T&E say that instead of tackling the problem governments were backing a controversial UN offsetting scheme known as Corsia.
Andrew Murphy of T&E said: \'When it comes to climate, Ryanair is the new coal\' (pictured: a Ryanair jet on the runway in Malaga, Spain)
These offsetting schemes enable airlines to invest in cheaper alternatives but their projects may not come to fruition and place responsibility on a third-party.
Mr Murphy argued: \'Aviation is Europe\'s biggest climate failure. The worst thing we can do in response is to put all our hopes in an offsetting scheme that gives airlines a license to grow indefinitely.
\'But that is exactly what airlines have cooked up at the industry-dominated UN aviation agency. The time has come for a big change in Europe\'s aviation policy.

MILAN, April 11 (Reuters) - Italy\'s biggest lender UniCredit said it is among a group of banks accused of running a cartel in trading euro zone government bonds between 2007 and 2012, years when financial crises dragged down banks and several European countries.
UniCredit made the disclosure on Wednesday night at the request of Italy\'s market watchdog, more than two months after the European Commission revealed that some traders at eight unnamed banks had exchanged commercially sensitive information and coordinated trading strategies in euro-denominated bonds.
UniCredit said the commission suspected some of its subsidiaries had violated anti-trust rules and that it might be slapped with a cash fine, though it deemed this unlikely. EU rules allow for a fine of up to 10 percent of global turnover.
The bank\'s shares were down 1.7 percent in morning trade.
Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier declined to comment on the matter as he arrived for the bank\'s annual shareholder meeting in Milan on Thursday morning.
"I have nothing to say," he told a reporter who asked if the bank would make financial contingency plans for a potential EU fine.
UniCredit said in a statement: "On the basis of the current information, it is not possible to reliably estimate the amount of any potential fine.". It has until April 29 to raise objections to the commission\'s allegations.
The commission revealed in January that the alleged bond cartel had been run by some traders mainly via online chatrooms, saying its charges did not imply that anti-competitive conduct was a general practice in the euro zone government bond sector.
European banks have already paid out billions of euros in fines, including for rigging interest rate benchmarks used to price home loans.
In a separate, earlier case, the commission charged Deutsche Bank, Credit Agricole, Credit Suisse and a fourth bank in December with being part of a bond cartel, also citing traders using chatrooms. (Additional reporting by Silvia Aloisi Writing by Mark Bendeich Editing by David Holmes)


DUBLIN, April 4 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel will meet residents who live along the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland during a visit to Dublin on Thursday to discuss Brexit to learn what impact any return of frontier checks would have on their lives.
Ireland\'s 500 km (350 mile) border with British-governed Northern Ireland will be the United Kingdom\'s only EU land frontier after Brexit, and the question of how to retain seamless trade across it has been a major hurdle in efforts to ensure the UK quits the bloc in an orderly fashion.
That becomes an even more difficult task if Britain leaves the bloc without a deal as Dublin has pledged to maintain the integrity of the European Union\'s single market, where goods move freely around the bloc without the need for checks.
Britain, Ireland and the EU fear the installation of physical customs infrastructure on the border could reignite largely dormant sectarian tensions and prove a tempting target for militants seeking a united Ireland and those who oppose it.
Merkel will use her trip to meet Prime Minister Leo Varadkar to consider the border situation and how to prevent a no-deal "hard Brexit", she said on Wednesday.
The leaders will participate in a roundtable discussion in Dublin with people from Northern Ireland and the border area ahead of their meeting, the Irish government said.
"These are people for whom the border is a very real issue - people from communities along the border, from business, and with direct personal experience of conflict before the Good Friday Agreement," the government said in a statement, referring to the 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of violence.
"It is important to hear their voices as we work together to deal with the challenges that Brexit presents."
Ireland has for months refused to countenance any no-deal contingency plans for the border but recently began discussions with the European Commission over how it might be managed if its nearest neighbour crashes out of the bloc.
No plan has been agreed as a result of those ongoing talks, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Tuesday.

The UK has the highest prison population in western Europe, a new report has found.
A snapshot of figures showed more than 90,000 people were locked up in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Of more than 40 administrations included in the analysis, only Russia had more inmates, with just over 600,000.

The UK has had the highest prison population in the EU every year since 2008 at least, according to the Council of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s annual penal statistics.
It said there were 84,373 inmates in England and Wales at the end of 2017, including a small number of individuals in immigration detention.

The number of inmates in England and Wales, which has nearly doubled in 25 years, has come under the spotlight after a safety crisis swept through much of the estate.
Ministers are considering scrapping sentences of six months or less for some offences in an effort to drive down re-offending rates and relieve pressure on crowded jails.


BERLIN (AP) - German authorities have indicted a Sri Lankan man suspected of involvement in killing 15 captured government soldiers while fighting for the Tamil Tigers rebel group.
Federal prosecutors said Friday that 37-year-old Sivatheeban B. is accused of membership in a foreign terrorist organization, war crimes, two cases of manslaughter and 11 cases of attempted manslaughter.
The man, whose surname wasn\'t released due to German privacy rules, was arrested in August.
Prosecutors allege that in 2008 the suspect guarded 15 captured soldiers as they were driven to a site where they were executed, and later helped burn their bodies. In a separate incident a year later, he fired on 13 soldiers, two of whom died.
The rebel group, which fought for a separate state for ethnic minority Tamils, was defeated in 2009.

April 8 (Reuters) - European stocks fell on Monday following a week of strong gains, with losses in technology stocks and European suppliers of U.S. planemaker Boeing, weighing the most.
The pan-region STOXX 600 index was down 0.2 percent at 0940 GMT, having touched eight-month highs last week.
Stocks in Spain fell the most, down 0.73 percent, while Germany\'s trade sensitive DAX index fell 0.5 percent, breaking a seven day winning streak - its longest since October 2017.
Earlier on Monday data showed that German exports and imports fell more than expected in February, the latest sign that Europe\'s biggest economy will likely post meager growth in the first quarter.
"It\'s a very, very slow start, with most sectors down with a little bit of profit taking after last week," said Mark Taylor, sales trader at Mirabaud Global Thematic Group in London.
Taylor also said there was a \'buying drought\' given the absence any new headlines on trade, with investors watching for Brexit developments, the European Central Bank\'s policy meeting and China data at the end of the week.
The European Central Bank is expected to hold borrowing costs on Wednesday amid slowing growth indicators, while later in the week, China is expected to report loan growth, inflation and trade data.
In Spain, airports operator Aena was among the biggest drags on the index, after RBC downgraded the stock to \'underperform\' from \'sector perform\' as it expects regulatory risk to be priced in over the next 12 months.
Software company SAP, Europe\'s most valuable technology company, weighed the most on the STOXX 600 index, with shares down about 2 percent after it said the head of its cloud business group had quit, the latest in a string of top departures.
Boeing\'s European suppliers Safran, Melrose and Meggitt came under pressure after the planemaker said it would cut monthly output of its 737 aircraft by nearly 20 percent in the wake of two deadly crashes.
Meanwhile, French rival Airbus rose 0.9 percent.
Continental AG slipped 1.8 percent as Kepler Cheuvreux downgraded the auto parts maker to "hold" from "buy".
Auto stocks regained some of their early losses after a near 7 percent surge last week, including Daimler which had been weighed down by the prospect of potentially hefty fines after EU antitrust regulators charged the company along with Volkswagen and BMW with colluding to block the rollout of clean emissions technology.
"These are minor moves given the rally the auto sector has had over the past two or three weeks. If anything, the sector has rallied off its lows so it seems like there is still money to get out there," Taylor said.
Italian-U.S. carmaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) gains also helped cap declines in the auto sector.
Fiat Chrysler agreed to pay electric carmaker Tesla Inc hundreds of millions of euros to allow Tesla vehicles to be counted in its fleet to avoid fines for violating new EU emission rules.
Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank dropped after European bank supervisors demanded a detailed roadmap outlining the pace and scale of staff cuts in the two lenders as they explore a merger, according to German daily Handelsblatt\'s report.
Irish stocks, a barometer of Brexit sentiment, ended a six-day winning run.
Britain\'s government held out the possibility of compromise with the opposition Labour Party on Sunday to try to win support in parliament for leaving the European Union with a deal. UK Prime Minister Theresa May heads to Brussels this week to ask for a further delay until June 30.

It\'s that time of the season when a select few teams defy the laws of physics. As spring unfolds, they develop the ability to be in two places at once.\xc2\xa0
The explanation for Napoli\'s inability to beat 10-man guests Genoa was that they were \'already in London\', thinking about their upcoming Europa League tie with Arsenal.\xc2\xa0
It was a similar situation for the Premier League side who flopped on Merseyside, with their minds supposedly back in Islington for Thursday\'s first leg.
Napoli arrive in London in stuttering form - the Europa League is now a major objective\xc2\xa0
It was 30 years ago that a Diego Maradona inspired Napoli to UEFA Cup glory\xc2\xa0
Carlo Ancelotti needs to use all his guise to steer the Italians past Arsenal in the tournament
All talk in the bay of Naples is of the quarter-final between Carlo Ancelotti\'s outfit and Unai Emery\'s fifth-placed side. The scudetto race may have fizzled out in January, but UEFA\'s secondary tournament provides the southern Italians with an objective.
Napoli won this trophy exactly 30 years ago, when Diego Maradona and his men defeated Germans Stuttgart in a two-legged final. But that is a rare success story on foreign turf. Napoli have got a mental block in continental football, and need every drop of Ancelotti\'s experience to get past the north Londoners.
On several occasions the Azzurri have appeared on the verge of a great achievement against a more powerful side with superior resources, before collapsing under pressure, exhaustion, or a lack of self-belief. When they face a team with the wealth (or ego) of a true Champions League contender, it rarely ends well.
In 1988, their first appearance in the European Cup, Maradona and Co went out meekly to Real Madrid 3-1 on aggregate in the first round. More recently, in 2012, they toppled Chelsea 3-1 in the round of 16 first leg.\xc2\xa0
The city went mad, but a few weeks later at Stamford Bridge, the Blues turned the tie around 4-1, to go through in extra-time and eventually win the cup.
Two years ago it was Zinedine Zidane\'s Real who shrugged off going a goal down in the first leg in Spain to send Napoli out 6-2 over both ties.\xc2\xa0
When Lorenzo Insigne scored a brilliant goal after eight minutes at the Bernabeu against the holders, the impossible seemed possible. Napoli, dressed from head to toe in black, looked mean and ready cause an upset. But it wasn\'t to be.
Napoli arrive in England bidding to mark their famous UEFA Cup triumph 30 years on
Napoli dropped into the Europa League after finishing third in their Champions League group\xc2\xa0
This season Ancelotti\'s men froze at Anfield in the last group match, tumbling out of the competition, despite only losing once. They almost achieved the miracle of qualifying from a group with five-times European champions Liverpool and cash kings Paris Saint-Germain. Almost.
That defeat by Klopp\'s Reds was indicative of a club with an inferiority complex in Europe. Throughout the years Napoli have had some fine players, from Maradona to Careca, Cavani to Koulibaly. Yet their record in continental competition is poor.
One of the reasons president Aurelio De Laurentiis hired Ancelotti was for his Euro-prowess. As a coach \'Carletto\' is one of only three men to win the Champions League three times. As a midfielder he lifted it twice.\xc2\xa0
The ex-Chelsea chief is a cup specialist, indeed his biography is called \'I Prefer the Cup\' which is a play on words on his trophy gathering and his favourite cut of meat, which runs from the neck to the shoulder of the pig, and is known as \'coppa\' in Italian.
Napoli\'s recent league form has been enough to put their boss off his dinner however. They toiled to a shock loss at Empoli and stalemate at home to Genoa.\xc2\xa0
Napoli have toiled in Serie A lately but it means more attention will be placed on Europe
On reason Ancelotti was hired by Napoli was because of his record in cup competitions\xc2\xa0
\'We aren\'t defending the way we should be. Recently our defending has been the worst since I arrived,\' said Ancelotti. The ongoing absence of injured centre-back Raul Albiol is a big blow.
The Italian team do hold one advantage over Arsenal. Napoli are guaranteed Champions League football next season, sitting seven points ahead of third-placed Inter and 12 points away from Atalanta in fifth.\xc2\xa0
They are fighting on one front, while Emery\'s men are languishing in fifth and desperate to return to Europe\'s top club tournament after a two-year absence. When asked about motivation, Ancelotti said \'if the players need a \'dream\' to aim for, we\'ve got one. It starts on Thursday night\'.
Napoli go into the quarter-final with concerns over midfield dynamo Allan\'s form. On song, the Brazilian is a buzzing menace, and Napoli need him to bounce back. On a more positive not, devilish Belgian forward Dries Mertens is crackling back into life after a patchy campaign and captain Insigne is back from a problem with his right thigh.
Napoli supporters are pleased with how Ancelotti has rotated the squad this season\xc2\xa0
There is no better time for Napoli to exorcise their ghosts than\xc2\xa0 the anniversary of a big triumph
Fans have appreciated how Ancelotti has rotated his squad much more than Maurizio Sarri did. In theory that will enable the team to tackle the final rounds of the Europa League with focus and freshness.
But, Carletto\'s real mission is the work on his players\' self-belief. Too many times the men from the Stadio San Paolo have succumbed to the pressure and anxiety of facing a prestigious opponent. There\'s no better time to exorcise those ghosts than on the 30th anniversary of their solitary European trophy.
Their feet, lungs and hearts have rarely been in doubt, but it\'s their minds which will hold the key in north London.

The bank\'s shares were up 0.44 percent by 1217 GMT, having earlier fallen around 2 percent in morning trade.
Asked about the probe on the sidelines of the bank\'s annual shareholder meeting in Milan on Thursday, Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier told reporters: "If you knew what I know, you\'d use the title of a Shakespeare play, it\'s \'Much ado about nothing\'.
He declined to comment about whether the bank would set aside cash to cover for a potential EU fine.
A source close to the matter said the investigation could be linked to transactions conducted by a junior bond trader who worked for a few months at the bank\'s German unit. The source said the trader did not have access to the primary bond market, without giving further details.
UniCredit said in a statement: "On the basis of the current information, it is not possible to reliably estimate the amount of any potential fine.". It has until April 29 to raise objections to the commission\'s allegations.
Analysts at Jefferies said the maximum potential fine for the bank could be about 2 billion euros.
The commission revealed in January that the alleged bond cartel had been run by some traders mainly via online chatrooms, saying its charges did not imply that anti-competitive conduct was a general practice in the euro zone government bond sector.

\xe2\x80\x9cI know it was taken by some to be directed at English people. It certainly was not and is not.\xe2\x80\x9d
She described the slogan as a \xe2\x80\x9cfairly blunt statement at any time\xe2\x80\x9d.
Speaking on RTE Radio 1 she said: \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose all of us have to be conscious of not just what we say and what is meant, but also what is heard and what is understood.\xe2\x80\x9d
Asked whether she was inching towards an apology, she replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have to inch towards anything\xe2\x80\xa6 for anybody who felt that it was directed at English people I just want to reassure them that that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case.
\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I have blood relatives myself who are English \xe2\x80\xa6 and English people are very welcome in Ireland.
\xe2\x80\x9cMany of them live amongst us, they are our neighbours and our friends, so certainly I apologise to anybody who felt that the banner was intended in that way, and I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to clarify that it\xe2\x80\x99s not. It certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that.\xe2\x80\x9d
On the political sentiment behind the banner, Ms McDonald said she would not apologise for being \xe2\x80\x9ca united Irelander\xe2\x80\x9d and for wanting unity and democracy across Ireland.
\xe2\x80\x9cFar from apologising for it, I wear that political position as a badge of honour,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.
The Democratic Unionist Party said Ms McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s apology was motivated by poll ratings rather than remorse.
East Antrim MLA Gordon Lyons said: \xe2\x80\x9cMary Lou McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s apology is a cynical response to falling poll ratings rather than any acknowledgement of remorse.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt is testament to Sinn Fein\xe2\x80\x99s place on the sidelines of politics that gaffes by their new president have been their most significant contribution to politics in recent months.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt is clear however that a drop in support has pressed those who take the decisions within Sinn Fein to stop defending the banner and belatedly send Mary Lou McDonald out to issue this supposed apology.\xe2\x80\x9d
Mr Lyons said if the party\xe2\x80\x99s leadership was truly focused on repairing the damage it would commit to working with all other parties to restore the Stormont Assembly.


MILAN, April 5 (Reuters) - Italy\'s Salini Impregilo is talking to state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) over a plan to create a national construction champion, the company\'s chief executive said on Friday.
"There are negotiating tables open with CDP and banks on the project", Pietro Salini told Reuters in an interview.
Salini, which is planning to take over troubled rival Astaldi, wants to help consolidate the sector and build a bigger and stronger player that can compete at an international level, Salini said.
Astaldi is one of several Italian construction companies struggling in an economy that slipped into a new recession at the end of last year. The sector was the worst hit during Italy\'s previous economic downturn.
Earlier on Friday, the head of CDP\'s banking foundation shareholders, Giuseppe Guzzetti, said that the Italian state lender could invest in a project to create a major domestic construction player. (Reporting by Stephen Jewkes; editing by Valentina Za)


Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd, pictured above in a court in Georgia, is appealing against his conviction over the death of Charlotte Brown
Speedboat\xc2\xa0killer Jack Shepherd has vowed to pursue his \xe2\x80\x98human rights\xe2\x80\x99 at Europe\xe2\x80\x99s top court to clear his name.
He is appealing against his conviction over the death of Charlotte Brown \xe2\x80\x93 whom he still blames for the tragedy.\xc2\xa0
But if British courts reject his bid for freedom, he plans to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights \xe2\x80\x93 which has the power to rule his trial was unfair.\xc2\xa0
Yesterday a source close to his legal team in Georgia, where he fled last year, said: \xe2\x80\x98He will pursue every avenue to clear his name. Jack knows his rights...
\xe2\x80\x98He will take it to the European Court of Human Rights if he can. But he is quietly confident his first appeal will succeed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0
Shepherd, 31, was last July convicted at the Old Bailey in his absence for the manslaughter of Miss Brown, 24, who died when his speedboat flipped on the Thames on a drunken first date in 2015.
Miss Brown, 24, died when his speedboat flipped on the Thames on a drunken first date in 2015.\xc2\xa0He has issued a reluctant apology to Miss Brown\xe2\x80\x99s parents, but shamelessly continues to blame her for her own death
His legal aid-funded appeal is based on perceived legal errors made by the judge in relation to his police interview.
If it fails, he could ask the Strasbourg court to uphold his \xe2\x80\x98human right to a fair trial\xe2\x80\x99, claiming he was unable to defend himself properly at the Old Bailey \xe2\x80\x93 even though this is because he had absconded.
The Strasbourg court has nothing to do with the European Union and Britain will remain under its jurisdiction after Brexit.
Shepherd, a web designer who spent ten months living incognito in Georgia before a Daily Mail investigation tracked him down, is due to be extradited to the UK tomorrow to start his six-year jail sentence. He is expected to face an Old Bailey judge on Thursday.
If British courts reject his bid for freedom, he plans to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights \xe2\x80\x93 which has the power to rule his trial was unfair
He has issued a reluctant apology to Miss Brown\xe2\x80\x99s parents, but shamelessly continues to blame her for her own death. He claims she was driving his defective speedboat when it hit a floating log.
He said from his cell in the Georgian capital Tbilisi: \xe2\x80\x98Her actions led to the fatal accident.\xe2\x80\x99
At his trial, prosecutors said that, if it was true, he was even more culpable for her death because as captain he should have known that Miss Brown, a business consultant from Clacton, Essex, had no experience with boats.
Shepherd said: \xe2\x80\x98Ultimately, it was her action to accelerate in the manner that she did, even though I failed to prevent her. You see, it\xe2\x80\x99s shared [responsibility].\xe2\x80\x99
He added: \xe2\x80\x98There are matters of luck and fate \xe2\x80\x93 an unseen log in the path of the boat. In the end I survived while Charlotte lost her life. Things could have been very different.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0
He admitted \xe2\x80\x98some of the moral responsibility for Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s death\xe2\x80\x99 and said he understood why her family blamed him.
He has issued an apology to Miss Brown\xe2\x80\x99s parents, but continues to blame her for her own death. He claims she was driving his defective speedboat (above) when it hit a floating log\xc2\xa0
Referring to Miss Brown\xe2\x80\x99s parents, Graham Brown and Roz Wickens, he said: \xe2\x80\x98Absolutely, unreservedly, I apologise for the role I played. But the reality is not quite so simple. I am very sorry for what happened. It was a tragedy and if I could do anything to change what happened I really would.\xe2\x80\x99
Asked if he regretted fleeing before his trial, he said: \xe2\x80\x98Primarily, yes. The consequences for me and others, the way I\xe2\x80\x99m perceived, it\xe2\x80\x99s upset a lot of people and it was against my own interests also ... But also, the choice I felt I faced ...was between running and suicide.\xe2\x80\x99
Miss Brown\xe2\x80\x99s mother said: \xe2\x80\x98Nothing he says will bring my daughter back.\xe2\x80\x99


Fighting in Libya has sparked fears of a fresh migrant influx into Europe as smugglers could take advantage of the unstable government to launch boats across the Med.\xc2\xa0
The Libyan coast guard, operated by UN-backed Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, is one of the main safeguards against smugglers and caught 15,000 migrants last year.
But that government is now in peril as commander Khalifa Hafter\'s forces pushed further into the city on Monday after a weekend of fighting that saw both sides carry out airstrikes around the ruins of the international airport.
Fighting in Libya has sparked fears that it could open the gates to a fresh European migrant influx, as people smugglers exploit the chaos to launch boats into the Med\xc2\xa0 (file image)
Thousands of Libyans displaced by the fighting could also join migrants from sub-Saharan Africa in trying to reach Europe, as the UN warns of \'significant population displacement\'
Commander\xc2\xa0Khalifa Hafter\'s forces pushed further into Tripoli on Monday as he attempts to wrest control of the country from UN-backed\xc2\xa0Fayez al-Sarraj
At least 32 people have been killed in fighting so far with 50 more injured. Many civilians remain trapped by the sudden outburst of violence.\xc2\xa0
Another 2,800 people have been displaced by the fighting, with the UN warning of \'significant population displacement\' if the conflict continues.
Hafter\'s army, which is thought to be backed by Russian mercenaries, advanced rapidly towards the city over the weekend, prompting US forces to retreat.
Who is Khalifa Hafter? Born in 1943 in the eastern town of\xc2\xa0Ajdabiya, Khalifa Hafter was a officer under Gaddafi\'s command when he seized power in 1969. As a reward for his loyalty and service, Gaddafi promoted Hafter to field marshal and put in charge of Libyan forces in Chad. Defeated by French-backed Chadian forces, Hafter was captured in 1987.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Gaddafi, who had long denied the presence of Libyan troops in Chad, cut ties with him - prompting Hafter to vow revenge. During a two-decade exile in the US, Hafter is thought to have plotted with the CIA to overthrow his old master, before returning in 2011 to fight in the uprising against Gaddafi\'s regime. After the Libyan dictator was deposed and killed, Hafter spent time fighting rebels in the east - where he is popular - before seizing key oil supplies from UN-backed groups. Given access to Russian mercenaries who have provided training to his forces, Haftar has now launched an offensive to seize control of the country.
But the advance slowed on Monday as troops moved into urban areas.\xc2\xa0
Meanwhile the EU called for a ceasefire and the resumption of peace talks. French officials also called for a halt to fighting for fresh negotiations.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Renewed civil war in Libya, splintered into areas of factional control since the 2011 overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, also threatens to disrupt oil and gas supplies and allow Islamist militants - such as ISIS militants fresh off the battlefields of Syria - to exploit the chaos.
The eastern Libyan National Army (LNA) forces of Khalifa Haftar, a former officer in Gaddafi\'s army, said 19 of their soldiers had died in recent days as they closed in on the internationally recognised government in Tripoli.\xc2\xa0
The LNA has made air strikes on the south of the city as it seeks to advance into the centre from the disused airport.
But the Tripoli government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj, which reported 11 deaths without specifying on which side, has armed groups arriving from nearby Misrata to block the LNA.
Al-Serraj, 59, who comes from a wealthy business family, has run the Tripoli government since 2016 as part of a U.N.-brokered deal boycotted by Haftar.
The LNA, allied with a parallel eastern administration based in Benghazi, took the oil-rich south of Libya earlier this year before its surprisingly fast push towards the coastal capital.
While that advance was straightforward through mostly sparsely populated areas, taking Tripoli is a far bigger challenge.\xc2\xa0
The violence has thrown into doubt a U.N. plan for an April 14-16 conference to plan elections as a way out of the anarchy since the Western-backed toppling of Gaddafi eight years ago.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the latest international appeal for talks to end the fighting.
The sudden advance of Hafter\'s forces towards Tripoli forced US troops to withdraw on Sunday, along with Indian peacekeepers
Federica Mogherini, the EU\'s foreign policy chief, called for a ceasefire and a return to peace talks on Monday as the conflict raged on
"We have made clear that we oppose the military offensive by Khalifa Haftar\'s forces and urge the immediate halt to these military operations against the Libyan capital," he said.
A contingent of U.S. forces evacuated at the weekend.
The U.N. mission to Libya called on Sunday for a truce for two hours in southern Tripoli to evacuate civilians and wounded, but it did not appear to have been heeded.
Haftar casts himself as a foe of extremism but is viewed by opponents as a new dictator in the mould of Gaddafi, whose four-decade rule saw torture, disappearances and assassinations.
Haftar enjoys the backing of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, which see him as a bulwark against Islamists and have supported him militarily, according to U.N. reports.
Forces with the Tripoli government have announced an operation to defence the capital called "Volcano of Anger".
Allied groups from Misrata down the coast have been moving pickup trucks fitted with machine guns into Tripoli.
The LNA says it has 85,000 men but this includes soldiers paid by the central government that it hopes to inherit. Its elite force, Saiqa (Lightning), numbers some 3,500, while Haftar\'s sons also have well-equipped troops, LNA sources say.
Since NATO-backed rebels ousted Gaddafi, Libya has been a transit point for hundreds of thousands of migrants trekking across the Sahara in hope of reaching Europe across the sea.
Libya since Gaddafi: How the country went from liberation to the brink of civil war Libya has been mired in chaos since the ouster and killing of dictator Colonel Gaddafi in 2011, with two rival authorities and a multitude of militias vying for control of the oil-rich country. Strongman Khalifa Haftar\'s forces were pushed back Friday from a key checkpoint less than 30 kilometres (18 miles) from Tripoli, checking their lightning advance on the capital, seat of the country\'s internationally recognised unity government. Haftar supports a parallel administration based in the east. Here is a timeline of the Mediterranean country\'s descent into turmoil: Former dictator Colonel Gaddafi was the Libyan leader from 1969 until 2011. During the Libyan civil war the government was overthrown, and Gaddafi retreated to Sirte, only to be captured and killed Gaddafi killed Triggered by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, demonstrations erupt in Libya in February 2011. A coalition led by Washington, Paris and London lends its backing to an armed revolt. Gaddafi, in power for 42 years, flees the capital. He is captured and killed on October 20, 2011 during a battle for his hometown Sirte, east of Tripoli. Three days later, the rebel National Transitional Council (NTC) declares Libya\'s \'total liberation\'. In August 2012 the NTC hands power to a transitional authority elected a month earlier - the General National Congress (GNC). Embassies targeted US ambassador Chris Stevens and three American staff are killed in a September 11, 2012 attack on their consulate in Libya\'s second city Benghazi. An Al-Qaeda-linked jihadist group is blamed. A car bomb in April 2013 targets France\'s embassy in Tripoli, wounding two French guards. Most foreign delegations withdraw from the country. Rival governments Dissident army general Haftar launches an offensive in May 2014 against jihadist groups in Benghazi. He is backed by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Several military officers from the east join his self-styled Libyan National Army. As nationalists and Islamists vie for power, legislative elections are held in June and the GNC is replaced by a parliament dominated by anti-Islamists. Islamist-led militias contest the results and group under the banner of \'Fajr Libya\' (Libya Dawn). They storm Tripoli in August, installing their own \'national salvation\' government and restoring the GNC. The elected house, which has international recognition, takes refuge in the eastern city of Tobruk near the border with Egypt. Thus the country finds itself with two governments and two parliaments. After months of negotiations and international pressure, lawmakers from the rival parliaments sign an accord in December 2015 in Morocco to set up a UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA). In March 2016, GNA chief Fayez al-Sarraj arrives in Tripoli to set up the new government, but Haftar\'s rival administration refuses to recognise its authority. Peace talks, armed groups In July 2017, Sarraj and Haftar meet for talks near Paris where they agree to a ceasefire and commit to elections the following year. In May 2018, weeks after suicide attackers from the Islamic State group kill 14 people at Libya\'s electoral commission, the two men meet again in the French capital and commit to holding parliamentary and presidential polls at the end of the year. In June 2018, a militia attacks two northeastern oil sites under Haftar\'s control through which oil is exported. After days of fighting, Haftar\'s forces announce they are back in \'full control\' and have also seized the city of Derna from radical Islamists. In January 2019 Haftar launches an offensive into oil-rich southern Libya, ostensibly aimed at wiping out \'terrorists\' and criminal groups. His forces seize the region\'s capital Sebha and one of the country\'s main oil fields without a fight. Conferences On February 28 the UN says Libya\'s rivals have met and agreed to hold polls. In March the UN says it will organise an all-party conference the next month to draw up a \'road map\' for Libya, including setting dates for legislative and presidential elections. Later in March the African Union says it will host a \'reconciliation\' conference in July aimed at uniting Libya\'s political rivals. Advance on Tripoli On Wednesday, Haftar\'s forces announce they are gearing up to move on the west of the country including Tripoli. A day later powerful armed groups from the western city of Misrata, loyal to the Tripoli government, vow to block the threatened advance. UN chief Antonio Guterres expresses deep concern over the risk of a major flare-up in Libya. Haftar orders his troops to advance on Tripoli, saying \'the time has come\'. The strongman\'s forces seize a key security barrier within 27 kilometres of the capital later that day without any fighting, General Abdessalem al-Hassi says. But on Friday, a security source says militiamen from the nearby coastal town of Zawiya retake the base after \'a short exchange of fire\'.\xc2\xa0

LONDON (AP) - With the completion of their domestic title defenses seeming a formality, Barcelona and Juventus can now focus on the Champions League.
For the rest of the quarterfinalists it\'s a far more challenging period that will stretch their squads while ambitions at home and abroad are juggled.
Here is a look at this week\'s first legs:
TOTTENHAM-MANCHESTER CITY
Just like last season, Manchester City comes up against a Premier League rival in the quarterfinals.
Different this time is not only the opponent - Tottenham rather than Liverpool - but also the surroundings. City will be Tottenham\'s second opponents in its new 62,000-capacity stadium in north London on Tuesday.

"I don\'t care about the stadium," City playmaker Kevin De Bruyne said. "I care about the team we play. Everybody talks about the stadium like it\'s something special. Everybody has a stadium. Everybody has supporters."
If De Bruyne sounds irritated it\'s not because of the state of City\'s campaign. Pep Guardiola\'s team remains in a quadruple chase after reaching the FA Cup final with a victory over Brighton on Saturday, having already won the League Cup and sitting second in the Premier League.
The Champions League is the one major honor to elude City in the 11 years since Abu Dhabi investment transformed the club. City hasn\'t even reached a final, falling at this stage last year to Liverpool, but is the competition\'s top scorer this season with 26 goals.
Tottenham is in a scrap just to qualify for a fourth successive season in the Champions League by finishing in the Premier League\'s top four. With a squad lacking reinforcements in the last year due to stadium building costs, Tottenham is third in the league, but only a point ahead of fifth-place Chelsea.
LIVERPOOL-PORTO
While Liverpool will be without banned right back Andy Robertson, Porto has two key players ruled out through suspension: playmaker Hector Herrera and Pepe, the center back who won three Champions League titles with Real Madrid.
Coach Sergio Conceicao will still be able to call on center back Eder Militao, who doesn\'t move to Madrid until next season, but left back Alex Telles remains doubtful due to a hip injury.
Porto, which last reached the quarterfinals four years ago, is chasing its first appearance in the semifinals since winning the Champions League under the then-emerging manager Jose Mourinho in 2004.
Fueled by Mohamed Salah\'s goals, Liverpool made it to last season\'s final, where the five-time European champion was beaten by Real Madrid.
The forward has rediscovered his scoring touch in time for the visit of Porto to Anfield on Tuesday, netting for the first time in nine games in a victory at Southampton on Friday. That took Liverpool to the top of the Premier League ahead of Manchester City.
Porto is being kept off top spot in Portugal by Benfica due to an inferior goal difference.
MANCHESTER UNITED-BARCELONA
The quarterfinals have been the end of Barcelona\'s Champions League journey for three successive seasons since winning a fifth European title in 2015.
United is in the last eight for the first time since 2014 when defeat helped spell the end of David Moyes\' reign as Alex Ferguson\'s immediate successor.
Victory at Paris Saint-Germain last month, though, contributed to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer being handed the United job on a three-year contract after convincing the ownership of his credentials during a three-month audition after Mourinho\'s firing.
United hosts Barcelona at Old Trafford on Wednesday with the luxury of having not played for more than a week since an April 2 loss to Wolverhampton.
"We will have less rest but on the other hand we will be more motivated by the victory over Atletico," Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said.
While Barcelona opened an 11-point Spanish league lead over Atletico with a 2-0 win on Saturday, United is in sixth place in the Premier League - two points off fourth with six games remaining.
AJAX-JUVENTUS
Juventus is hopeful Cristiano Ronaldo will be able to play some part in Wednesday\'s match after injuring a right thigh muscle on Portugal duty last month.
The forward participated in training on Sunday but Juventus will take no risks on the fitness of the hat trick scorer from the last-16 second leg against Atletico Madrid last month.
Moise Kean is ready to step in. The 19-year-old Italy forward has scored five goals in his past five matches for club and country.
While Juventus is one win away from securing a record-extending eighth Serie A title, Ajax is only leading the Eredivisie from PSV Eindhoven on goal difference.
Midfielder Frenkie de Jong, who joins Barcelona next season, was substituted as a precaution during Ajax\'s 4-1 victory over Willem II Tilburg on Saturday after hurting an ankle.
"We want to show Europe what we\'re worth," he said. "I think we\'ve already done that, but we want to confirm it."
Ajax won the Champions League in 1995 and was beaten in the following year\'s final. The Amsterdam club hasn\'t contested the quarterfinals since 2003, when it lost to AC Milan, and had to start in the qualifying rounds in July this season.

An Irish ex-bikie who has lived in Australia since he was six years old, but has spent time behind bars, will be deported after his visa was cancelled and his appeal rejected in the Federal Court.
John Paul Pennie, who moved to Australia with his parents in 1980, was sentenced in July 2015 to four-and-a-half years in a West Australian prison for charges including possessing methylamphetamine with intent to sell or supply and wilful destruction of evidence.
In January 2016, a delegate of the home affairs minister cancelled Pennie\'s visa, ruling he did not pass the character test due to his criminal record which included being a former vice president of the Bandidos bikies.
After the minister refused to revoke the cancellation, Pennie took his case to the Federal Court but on Thursday his application was rejected.
Pennie had claimed he feared a lack of medical care for his health issues in Ireland and that he would be homeless.
But Justice Katrina Banks-Smith said the minister had considered possible hardship and had not made an error.
Pennie also argued he did not pose an unacceptable risk to the Australian community, in part because he had severed ties with the Bandidos.
After Pennie announced he was leaving the club, he was told he had to stab a fellow inmate and assault another, but he refused, which led to Pennie being attacked in Casuarina prison.
"Different minds might reach different conclusions as to the likelihood of the applicant being exposed to contact with the Bandidos Motorcycle Club upon release into the community and the relevance of such exposure to the risk of harm to the Australian community," Justice Banks-Smith said.
"But that does not mean the minister\'s views can be described as illogical or irrational."


Brian O\xe2\x80\x99Driscoll fears Johnny Sexton\xe2\x80\x99s injury woes could be enough to derail Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup hopes in Japan this year.
The fly-half has not appeared for Leinster since the turn of the year, and was ruled out of last Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s Champions Cup quarter-final victory over Ulster with a quad issue.
He played in each Guinness 6 Nations clash for Joe Schmidt\xe2\x80\x99s side, but was forced off with a concussion following a heavy hit during their victory over Scotland at Murrayfield, an occupational hazard given the No 10\xe2\x80\x99s uncompromising style.
Johnny Sexton will miss his tenth Leinster game of the year when they play on Saturday night
And while there are other options, his former team-mate for club and country insists any hopes of lifting the Webb Ellis trophy in November are entwined with the fitness of the current World Player of the Year.
\xe2\x80\x98I think of course there\xe2\x80\x99s a worry,\xe2\x80\x99 said O\xe2\x80\x99Driscoll when asked about Sexton\xe2\x80\x99s domestic lay-off. \xe2\x80\x98You want your best player, or one of your best players, on the park whenever you can.
\xe2\x80\x98He definitely got targeted against Scotland and I felt as though all of the collisions were right on the line. But I think it would\xe2\x80\x99ve been hard to penalise any of those shots.
\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the way that Johnny plays the game. Of course you would worry a small bit about the aggressive nature he takes the ball with but that\xe2\x80\x99s his selflessness in creating space for others out wide.
\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a contingency with Joey Carbery in there, trying to give game time to the likes of Jack Carty as well, but if Ireland are to win the World Cup you do sense that they need Johnny Sexton.\xe2\x80\x99
Sexton played with O\'Driscoll, and his former team-mate fears for Ireland\'s hopes in Japan
O\'Driscoll praised the playing style of his former club-mate, but says his absence is worrying
Sexton will once again be absent on Saturday as Leinster entertain Benetton at The RDS, making it a total of 10 missed club outings in 2019.
At 33, he is approaching the business end of his career at the highest level and any attempt to prolong his time at the top is understandable.\xc2\xa0
O\'Driscoll, who is currently at the Cathay Pacific/HSBC Hong Kong Sevens, knows that alterations can be important to extending playing days.
HSBC have been trying to promote rugby throughout Hong Kong, trying to get schools to incorporate the sport into their curriculum, and BOD spent some of his Friday playing tag rugby as part of the scheme.
It was a reminder of why he had to alter his game late in his career and how the muscle fatigue catches up quicker. But he insists Sexton need not worry about doing the same.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
\xe2\x80\x98I had to modify my game but that\xe2\x80\x99s because the zip went in my legs,\xe2\x80\x99 said O\xe2\x80\x99Driscoll during the latest leg of the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series.
O\'Driscoll is an ambassador for the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series and is out in Hong Kong
\xe2\x80\x98At 10, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be out in the open field as much. If he has lost a half-yard, his brain thinks quicker than nearly everybody else and he\xe2\x80\x99s able to still pick the passes.
\xe2\x80\x98Providing he can still take those collisions on the advantage line and get up and shake them off I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll see Johnny Sexton back at his best.
\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a dream to play outside because he creates space for others and he does so by taking hits where other 10s would stay away from the line and self-preserve themselves a little bit.
\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s not Johnny\xe2\x80\x99s mentality and that\xe2\x80\x99s not his game plan. That\xe2\x80\x99s what makes him so great.\xe2\x80\x99
The No 10 concerns are not the only problems facing Ireland.
Leinster\xe2\x80\x99s Champions Cup success last Saturday came at a heavy price with Dan Leavy suffering a knee injury that has ruled him out of this Autumn\xe2\x80\x99s tournament.
\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a huge loss,\xe2\x80\x99 added the 40-year-old. \xe2\x80\x98To be brutally honest we\xe2\x80\x99ve struggled in the No 7 jersey.
\xe2\x80\x98Sean O\xe2\x80\x99Brien hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to refind the form that we saw a couple of years ago on the Lions tour.
\xe2\x80\x98I think we\xe2\x80\x99re lucky that we have an assembly of good quality back-rowers, but I really feel for Dan Leavy.\xe2\x80\x99
It was a sour note on what was a largely positive return for Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s stars to domestic action after a disappointing Six Nations campaign.
The 40-year-old also believes that the injury to Dan Leavy is a huge blow for Joe Schmidt\'s side
And O\xe2\x80\x99Driscoll insists the change of scenery will have done wonders for Schmidt\xe2\x80\x99s squad.
\xe2\x80\x98I would think they would have enjoyed going back to their provinces and even just getting away from the goldfish bowl that is the Ireland camp \xe2\x80\x93 particularly when it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go great,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.
\xe2\x80\x98The Six Nations will have been parked from their perspective and they\xe2\x80\x99ll pick it up again after their summer holidays.
\xe2\x80\x98Remember too, yes they were beaten well by Wales and quite well by England but they still did get bonus points against France and Italy and beat Scotland. So it\xe2\x80\x99s not all doom and gloom.
\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t labour these things and stride them around with you because it serves no purpose. You need to just be able to park them and look forward with excitement. Particularly when you have two other tournaments still to vie for.\xe2\x80\x99
Those two tournaments, the Pro14 and Champions Cup, still hold interest for at least two provinces. But only just.
Neither Leinster nor Munster were convincing as they booked their semi-final spots in Europe\xe2\x80\x99s premier competition, and O\xe2\x80\x99Driscoll, who lifted the trophy three times, thinks the likelihood of an Irish showdown in Newcastle is slim at best.
\xe2\x80\x98I personally don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99ll happen,\xe2\x80\x99 he admitted. \xe2\x80\x98It could absolutely be a Saracens v Toulouse final because of the quality.
Munster came through their Champions Cup quarter-final against Edinburgh last Saturday
Leinster squeezed through against Irish rivals Ulster and now face Toulouse in the semi-finals
\xe2\x80\x98I do feel as though Leinster will be able to edge it in the semi-final but I also fancy that Saracens will just have too much for Munster.
\xe2\x80\x98They just have a great squad, a very clear way of how they want to play the game.
\xe2\x80\x98They have very experienced players, some real strike runners and good finishers. So, for me, Sarries are still the team to beat.\xe2\x80\x99
Back in Hong Kong, it is the Fijians who O\'Driscoll is backing.
\'They have a special love for the Hong Kong sevens,\' he said of the Fiji supporters, some of whom have made the journey of over 5,000 miles to watch their country.
\'Their looking for five tournaments in a row and you\xe2\x80\x99d be a foolish man to bet against it.\'

BERLIN (AP) - German prosecutors say they\'ve charged a 26-year-old former Afghan officer with war crimes for allegedly abusing prisoners and defiling the corpse of a man he boasted he\'d "killed like a donkey."
Ahmad Zaheer D., whose last name wasn\'t given in line with privacy laws, is accused of shaking two prisoners by the hair during an interrogation around late 2013 and punching one, while another soldier hit a third with a hose.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that the suspect brought the corpse of a high-ranking enemy commander into a town in March 2014, telling villagers he\'d killed him and putting a meat hook into the corpse\'s head, then stringing the body up with a rope.
He was arrested Oct. 25 near Munich. It wasn\'t clear when he came to Germany.


In a Facebook video Beto O\'Rourke, a Democratic 2020 US presidential hopeful, likened President Donald Trump\'s comments about immigrants to those heard during Germany\'s Third Reich
Democratic US presidential candidate Beto O\'Rourke has compared Donald Trump\'s attacks on immigrants to Nazi Germany, saying at a campaign event that similar rhetoric might have been heard during the Third Reich.
Addressing a town hall gathering in Carroll, Iowa late Thursday, O\'Rourke recalled how Trump blasted Mexican immigrants as "rapists" and referred to some people seeking to enter the country as "animals" and an "infestation."
The former congressman from Texas also pointed to other troubling Trump behavior, including his effort to ban all Muslims from entering the country, and his seeming defense of white nationalists at a deadly rally in Virginia in 2017.
"Now we would not be surprised if, in the Third Reich, other human beings were described as an infestation, as a cockroach or a pest that you would want to kill," O\'Rourke told attendees, according to video posted on his Facebook page.
"But to do that in 2017 or \'18 in the United States of America doesn\'t make sense."
In a tweet last June, Trump berated Democrats as "the problem," and said "they don\'t care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13."
Trump frequently mentions MS-13, which is a particularly brutal criminal gang operating in the United States and Central America.
O\'Rourke is polling fourth in a Democratic field of at least 17 candidates including liberal Senator Bernie Sanders, and which may soon see former vice president Joe Biden enter the race.
O\'Rourke later acknowledged the Nazi comparison that he made in front of voters.
"I compared the rhetoric that the president has employed to rhetoric that you might have heard during the Third Reich. Calling human beings an infestation is something that we might have expected to hear in Nazi Germany," O\'Rourke told reporters.
"Describing immigrants.... as rapists and criminals. Seeking to ban all Muslims, all people of one religion," he added. "What other country on the face of the planet does that kind of thing?"
O\'Rourke\'s comparisons came as US lawmakers have been embroiled in heated debates in Congress about anti-Semitism and whether socialists are Nazis.
Six million Jews were exterminated by the Nazis in Europe between 1939 and 1945.


PARIS, April 8 (Reuters) - French renewable independent power producer (IPP) Total Eren said on Monday that it had concluded the acquisition of NovEnergia, a southern European power firm, after the approval of all stakeholders and clearance from Portuguese regulators.
Total Eren said the deal will diversify its portfolio of renewable assets and expand its presence in Southern Europe.
NovEnergia has an installed capacity of nearly 670 megawatts in Portugal, Italy, France, Spain, Poland and Bulgaria.
Total Eren did not disclose how much it paid for the deal, but said NovEnergia is valued at more than 1 billion euros ($1.12 billion) in terms of its enterprise value.
It said NovEnergia will increase its asset base, reaching more than 2,200 MW of renewable energy power plants including solar, wind, hydro, in operation or under construction worldwide. It is targeting 3,000 MW by 2022.
French oil and gas major Total holds a 23 percent stake in Total Eren.

Campaigners for victims in Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s worst ever fire have lodged an appeal for a fresh inquest.
The Stardust Campaign group has petitioned for a new inquest into the fire with Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney General, 38 years after their tragedy.
The Stardust Justice Campaign have petitioned the Attorney General for a new inquest today. @darraghmackin says the threshold for a new inquest has been met by the evidence they have submitted. pic.twitter.com/KGbHFDZB43 \xe2\x80\x94 aoife-grace moore. (@aoifegracemoore) April 2, 2019
Forty eight people lost their lives in the fire at the popular Stardust nightclub in Artane, Dublin at a Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day disco.
Campaigners say fresh evidence and new witness statements about the night of the fire provide enough assurance that a new inquest should be opened.
Only one emergency phone call is on public record from the night of the fire, but campaigners say they now have a signed statement from a woman who claims she made a second call about a fire on the roof of the nightclub.
The group also says it has evidence that the Electrical Supply Board had written to the owners of the Stardust about faulty electrical wiring before the fire occurred, all of which, it says, is crucial to the timing and cause of the fire.

Officials originally ruled that the cause of the fire was arson, a theory that was never accepted by the families.
Despite findings of safety breaches, there were no prosecutions over the incident.
Investigations into the fire showed that a number of escape routes from the dance hall were blocked as emergency doors were locked by chains, concerns have also been raised about the investigation of the scene, which allowed politicians and media to walk through the building just days after the fire.
Darragh Mackin, from Phoenix Law, and a solicitor for the families, says it has consulted experts from those involved with the Grenfell fire in London, and the 9/11 terror attacks.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe threshold for a fresh inquest is relatively modest, it is whether or not the Attorney General feels it is advisable, we say that is clear by the evidence presented to him today that the test is met,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.
\xe2\x80\x9cIn the opinion of the experts, a fresh inquest is advisable and can get to the bottom of what happened in the Stardust.
\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s greatest atrocity, and the truth is the very least these families deserve.\xe2\x80\x9d
Antoinette Keegan, who survived the fire but lost her sisters Mary and Martina in the blaze, says the families have never felt so confident.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe want truth and we want justice, it\xe2\x80\x99s not fair on the parents of their loved ones, Mrs (Bridget) McDermott is not well, my mother is 83, it\xe2\x80\x99s not fair how long this has continued.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s systematic abuse that the government has thrown at the families and it\xe2\x80\x99s time now it stops and we get the truth and justice we\xe2\x80\x99re entitled to.\xe2\x80\x9d
Mrs McDermott lost three children in the tragedy.
The Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar is due to meet the group on May 29, and previously said he would discuss the matter with the Attorney General after the petition had been submitted.
\xe2\x80\x9cSuccessive governments have failed, the Taoiseach has a responsibility, he has promised it so he has to fulfil it.\xe2\x80\x9d
Sinn Fein MEP Lynn Boylan has taken up the cause with the families, and says that it is unacceptable that the families had to find the new evidence themselves, with no legal aid.
A 2017 report by retired judge Pat McCartan found\xc2\xa0it was evident the fire was in the roof space, not a seat as previously stated, and that there were witnesses who had not been interviewed.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe McCartan report acknowledged there were witnesses out there but bizarrely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to find or question those witnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.
\xe2\x80\x9cSo we have a report that says there are witnesses out there with evidence that would counter what previous inquests have found, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to go and find them and it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the families to go find that evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d
The campaign group says it is unknown how long the Attorney General will take in making a decision but they are hopeful that a judgment can be made before the end of the summer.


European football\xe2\x80\x99s crackdown against racist behaviour by supporters has continued with punishments for Croatian champions GNK Dinamo and Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s Dynamo Kiev.
Last week, UEFA ordered Italy\xe2\x80\x99s Lazio, Ukrainian champions Shakhtar Donetsk and Czech side Slavia Prague to play their next home European ties in front of partially closed stadiums following racist chanting and other crowd disturbances in recent Europa League matches.
And on Monday, UEFA\xe2\x80\x99s control, ethics and disciplinary body ruled that GNK Dinamo\xe2\x80\x99s next two home games in European competition should take place behind closed doors, with the second of those games deferred for two years, while Dynamo Kiev were given the lesser sanction of a partial closure.
GNK Dinamo\xe2\x80\x99s offences took place during the first leg of the last-16 game against Benfica last month and they were also fined \xc2\xa340,000 for their fans setting off fireworks, throwing objects and blocking stairways, with a further \xc2\xa317,000 levied for the racism.
Dynamo Kiev were also charged with a range of offences, including racist behaviour, following their last-32 game against Olympiakos in February but, as this was a first offence, they were treated more leniently.
The Ukrainians came through that tie but were then soundly beaten by Chelsea in the last 16, although the Premier League side were also sanctioned by UEFA on Monday for the behaviour of their fans in their last-32 game against Malmo in Sweden on February 14.

The Blues were given a \xc2\xa311,000 fine for their fans throwing objects and invading the pitch, while their hosts were hit with a \xc2\xa349,000 fine because their supporters also threw objects and set off fireworks.
Monday\xe2\x80\x99s punishments for racist behaviour come a week after several England players were racially abused by Montenegro fans during their Euro 2020 qualifier in Podgorica and on the eve of a two-day anti-discrimination conference at Wembley co-hosted by UEFA, the Football Association and European campaign group Fare Network.


BERLIN (AP) - Police in northern Germany say they have detained a 17-year-old boy with several knives after being tipped off to an online chat in which someone threatened to kill several people at a school.
Officers checked students entering the school in Flensburg, just south of the Danish border, on Wednesday morning and detained the German teenager. Police said initial investigations firmed up suspicions against him, without elaborating. The chat surfaced on Tuesday evening and the threat applied to Wednesday.
Lessons were held as normal after boy was detained.


VATICAN CITY (AP) - Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."

Gerard Pique is delighted to see ex-Manchester United team-mate Ole Gunnar Solskjaer flourishing at Old Trafford \xe2\x80\x93 but the Barcelona defender is determined to kill off his former club\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League dreams on Wednesday.
Widely considered to be one of the greatest defenders in the world, the 31-year-old made his first steps in the professional game in the north west over a period that he remains eternally grateful for.
Pique joined from Barca aged 17 and went from a boy to a man at United, learning a lot on the field and off it before returning to the LaLiga giants in 2008.

Solskjaer was one of the senior pros as the centre-back came through the ranks and the Barca defender has been impressed by the work being done by someone he looked up to.
\xe2\x80\x9cI remember him as a great team-mate when I arrived here,\xe2\x80\x9d Pique said.
\xe2\x80\x9cI was 17, very young and he was one of the veterans and, for sure, he helped me a lot to adapt to the club, to the country, to the city.
\xe2\x80\x9cHe was at the end of his career and he had some problems with his injuries, but when you were training with him you could see he had that quality to score goals.
\xf0\x9f\x94\x8a @3gerardpique : "This is a very special match for me. I learned a lot in Manchester." #MUFCBar\xc3\xa7a pic.twitter.com/v18rpxf7sq \xe2\x80\x94 FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) April 9, 2019
\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a great experience playing alongside him. He helped me a lot and I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy to see him in now charge of the club, of Manchester United.
\xe2\x80\x9cHe is doing a great job since he took charge of the team.
\xe2\x80\x9cThey have won a lot of games, they are playing much better and tomorrow is going to be a tough game and I hope we can win.\xe2\x80\x9d
Solskjaer recalled playing with Pique in the Premier Reserve League play-off final in 2006, when they scored a goal apiece as they beat Tottenham 2-0.
The United boss called the defender a \xe2\x80\x9cfantastic boy\xe2\x80\x9d and has enjoyed watching his progress over the years, joking that one of his only issues was a fear of needles.

\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s true!\xe2\x80\x9d Pique said with a laugh.
\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, I hate that. \xe2\x80\x9cSince I was young, I really hated needles and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he remembered about it.\xe2\x80\x9d
Pique clearly made a lasting impression Solskjaer, just as United have on him.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something lovely because the fans are fantastic,\xe2\x80\x9d the defender said ahead of stepping out at Old Trafford for the first time since leaving in 2008.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the same if it\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League or a league game or playing against a fourth division side \xe2\x80\x93 the fans are always cheering if you lose or you win.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a different culture. You can see that both on and off the pitch. The fans are into their team.
\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always said that the English culture, I think we could learn a lot from them and one of the things would be this instance.\xe2\x80\x9d
But Pique\xe2\x80\x99s appreciation for United will be replaced by a steely resolve to hurt them on Wednesday.
The 31-year-old has been impressed by the never-say-die attitude brought back by Solskjaer, pointing to the way they made Champions League history by overcoming a 2-0 home loss to beat Paris St Germain 3-1 in the round of 16.
\xe2\x80\x9cI think the PSG tie is a great example,\xe2\x80\x9d Pique said. \xe2\x80\x9cI watched both games and here I think PSG first half was better, second half they scored and they could have scored some more goals.
\xe2\x80\x9cBut you cannot leave Manchester United alive.
\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can beat them scoring a lot of goals, you have to do it because they have great team, great history and they have shown in the second leg in Paris, even though they played with a lot of young lads from the academy, they won, they qualified in the last minute.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great example for us, we have to be very concentrated from the first minute to last minute of the tie.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe know that Manchester United are very dangerous and that we have to play our best game to qualify.\xe2\x80\x9d

UEFA initially gave AC Milan a two-year ban from European club competition for breaking its financial fair play (FFP) rules last summer
Seven-time European champions AC Milan have been referred to European governing body UEFA\'s financial regulator for failing to meet the break-even requirement for the second year in a row.
UEFA initially gave AC Milan a two-year ban from European club competition for breaking its financial fair play (FFP) rules last summer but the Serie A side successfully appealed against that sanction at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
Under UEFA\'s financial rules, clubs are not allowed to make losses of more than 30million euros (\xc2\xa326million) over three seasons, a cap UEFA believed AC Milan breached between 2015-17 when they spent \xc2\xa3200million on transfers.
\xc2\xa0AC Milan have been referred to European governing body UEFA\'s financial regulator for failing to meet the break-even requirement for the second year in a row
AC Milan, however, managed to persuade sport\'s highest court that their finances would improve under the ownership of American hedge fund Elliott Management Corporation, which had assumed control of the club last summer when former owner Li Yonghong missed a repayment on the loan he had taken to buy the club in 2017.
As a result of the appeal, the 18-time Italian champions were given until June 2021 to balance their books or receive a one-year ban from European club football, lost almost \xc2\xa311million in broadcasting revenue and prize money from last season\'s Europa League campaign and had a 21-man UEFA squad limit imposed on them for the next two seasons.
But in a short statement on Wednesday, UEFA announced that the investigatory chamber of its Club Financial Control Body was sending a new case against them to its adjudicatory chamber, this time for the three-year period between 2016-18.
In a short statement on Wednesday, UEFA announced that the investigatory chamber of its Club Financial Control Body was sending a new case against them to its adjudicatory chamber
\'This referral is not related to the decision that was made by the CFCB adjudicatory chamber in December 2018 concerning the previous monitoring period and was covering the reporting periods ending in 2015, 2016 and 2017,\' it said, adding that AC Milan have also appealed against the December ruling.
AC Milan are currently fourth in Serie A, five points behind city rivals Inter, with seven games to play. They have also reached the semi-finals of the Italian Cup and host Lazio in the second leg on April 24, after a 0-0 draw in Rome in February. They did not progress to the Europa League\'s knockout rounds, though.
Former Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis has been running the club since December and it is understood the Rossoneri are one of the clubs pressing for radical changes to the Champions League format that would lead to qualification being based on historic performance in European competitions, as opposed to recent domestic success.
UEFA\'s decision to start another financial fair play case against AC Milan comes at a time when some in the game have wondered if the governing body still had the stomach to take on Europe\'s most famous clubs after recent legal setbacks and the prospect of even bigger fights to come with Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain.

LONDON, April 4 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thousands of Europeans who sleep rough on Britain\'s streets could be at risk of further deprivation - be it detention or deportation - once the country leaves the European Union and they lose their right to remain.
While Britain\'s exact departure date is unclear, charities fear no amount of extra time will help thousands of homeless Europeans prepare the paperwork and complete the procedures needed to stay on legally in the country they now call home.
"Everybody is worried about Brexit," said Piotr, a 39-year-old Pole who lives on the streets of Northampton in central England.
Piotr moved to Britain 15 years ago but has now slept rough for months since losing his job in a warehouse.
"I want to stay in England, it\'s a fantastic country for me and the problem (of having no place to live) at the moment is because I couldn\'t find work," said Piotr, who preferred not to give his full name in a phone interview.
Piotr, whose family is in Poland and Germany, said he was "unhappy" on the streets and wanted to contribute to society.
He told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that many of his friends from Lithuania and Romania had faced extra hostility since Britons voted to leave the EU in 2016 and that his community felt ever more nervous about Brexit.
Although he had the proof of identity papers that many other homeless lacked, he still feared deportation.
"I want to stay legal in England."
LIMBO
A report by public policy consultancy WPI Economics - commissioned by national homelessness charities - said homeless EU citizens were a "key group" who risked new difficulties.
"Whatever happens with Brexit, it\'s going to be a real challenge for homelessness," said Matthew Oakley, director of WPI Economics and author of the report.
There is no consensus for the number of homeless people but a government snapshot showed that some 1,000 EU nationals slept rough in England on any given night last year, or one in five of England\'s entire homeless tally.
Homeless charities say total figures could be much higher, taking into account the \'hidden homeless\' - people who sofa surf, use temporary housing or sleep on transport.
Britain was due to leave the European Union in March, but amid intense political infighting, it is still unclear how, when or even if it will exit the bloc.
Europeans who arrived in the country before March 29 must apply for \'settled status,\' which will require paperwork and proof of identity that lawyers say many homeless people lack.
Without this, EU migrants may be at risk of staying in the country illegally and would be unable to access healthcare, pensions or social welfare benefits.
Homeless Europeans are more likely to be unaware of pending deadlines, lack internet access or fear interaction with authorities, the WPI report found.
"Anyone who isn\'t able to regularise their status by the deadline...could be thrown into detention or face deportation," said Zoe Gardner, policy advisor at JCWI, a legal charity that promotes immigrants\' rights.
Campaigners say Britain\'s push for tighter border controls and a crackdown on illegal immigration has created a \'hostile environment\' for immigrants and fuelled anti-EU sentiment.
"The story of the EU homeless in the UK is one that should be a national scandal," said Robin Burgess, chief executive of Hope Centre, an English homelessness charity.
"No doubt in a hardline post-Brexit world, deportations will follow. We know that fear of deportation made some EU migrants avoid coming to services, with the result they did not get help, and some died."
There was no way to corroborate this, but data show the number of people who died while homeless in England and Wales has climbed nearly a quarter in the last five years.
Burgess said hundreds of EU citizens lived in "unimaginable squalor" with growing resentment from locals who believe housing should be reserved for Britons. He fears Brexit could lead to further division, with EU nationals most likely to suffer.
"They say they may take their chances - but most have no real grasp of what may happen," Burgess said.
GO HOME
Britain used to deport homeless Europeans but a landmark court case in 2017 ruled it an abuse of EU rights to free movement. Now charities fear the practice may be resurrected.
"They (Europeans) remain deeply suspicious and concerned that the British government will...find a way to deport them after Brexit," said Jean Demars, one of the legal team that brought the 2017 case against the government.
The government says the High Court judgment will be valid after Britain leaves and that it has no anti-immigrant agenda.
"We have always been clear that we want EU citizens to stay," a spokesman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
A bus of immigration lawyers has toured the capital to offer free help to vulnerable EU nationals, including the homeless, and Mayor Sadiq Khan has given grants to support organisations.
"EU citizens living in the capital belong here and are welcome," Khan said in a statement. "It\'s critical that they get good quality advice and support."
The government\'s EU Settlement Scheme fully opened on March 29, with more than 50,000 applications made during the opening weekend, according to the government.
Britain is expected to leave the EU on May 22 if parliament rallies behind a government deal. Otherwise, it has until April 12 to offer a new plan or to leave without a treaty.
Or maybe not leave at all.
However the Brexit saga ends, homeless Europeans like Piotr hope they get to remain.
"I don\'t want to live on the street, this is not a life for me," said Piotr. "I hope everyone will stay in England." (Reporting by Adela Suliman; editing by Lyndsay Griffiths.

AIGLE, Switzerland (AP) - The International Cycling Union says cyclocross rider Denise Betsema tested positive for an anabolic steroid and is provisionally suspended.
Betsema, 26, placed fourth at the women\'s world championships race in February, when she was edged out of the medals by her Netherlands teammate Marianne Vos.
The UCI says Betsema tested positive one week earlier at a World Cup event in her home country.
Cycling\'s governing body did not specify which steroid she allegedly used.
No timetable was given by the UCI to prosecute the disciplinary case.
Betsema took bronze in the European Championships last year.

Another newborn baby has died following a botched circumcision attempt in Italy.
The boy reportedly died overnight on Tuesday near the port city of Genoa after his 25-year-old Nigerian mother and his grandmother called for emergency medical help.
When the ambulance arrived the child had already died.

Investigators told Italian news agency ANSA they suspected a third person carried out the circumcision and are checking the mother and grandmother\'s phone records to trace the suspect.
It is the third case of its kind in the last few months. A five-month-old baby died in Bologna last month after his parents performed a circumcision at home.
A manslaughter investigation was opened against the boy\'s parents - said to be of Ghanaian origin - by the prosecutor\'s office in the northern province of Reggio Emilia.
In December last year, a two-year-old boy died of severe blood loss as a result of a botched circumcision in Rome.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
In that case, his twin brother also nearly died but survived following intensive care treatment.\xc2\xa0
That operation had taken place in a centre provided by the non-profit organisation Arci and the council in Monterondo, a north-western suburb of Rome.

The doctor, who was believed to be an American citizen of Libyan origin, called for emergency help when the boy began excessively bleeding, Italian media reported at the time.\xc2\xa0
Circumcision is not practised among Italy\'s Roman Catholic majority.
It is largely the practise of Muslim immigrants who sometimes have trouble finding provisions for the procedure in hospital, either for cost or because some doctors refuse to perform circumcisions until boys are at least four.


BERLIN, April 10 (Reuters) - The European Union should help Britain reach an agreement for an orderly Brexit, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday, adding that he hoped a chaotic departure from the bloc could be averted.
"Everyone in Europe hopes that there will be an agreement between the government and opposition about the way to get an agreed Brexit," Scholz said.
"It\'s the task of the European Union to be helpful in a process in the United Kingdom like this," Scholz said. "I hope that the risk of a no-deal Brexit is decreasing."
German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants European Union leaders meeting later on Wednesday to grant Britain a delay in its divorce from the bloc, but also to make sure once a decision is made in London, Brexit can take place quickly.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - The European Central Bank has left its policy promises and interest rates unchanged as it weighs looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
The ECB has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve in pausing the withdrawal of stimulus measures deployed over a decade to bounce back from the global financial crisis, as central bankers around the world ponder which way the economy is headed. The Fed has already started raising rates but has backed off plans for further rate increases in 2019.
The ECB\'s 25-member governing council was content to stand pat on Thursday, making no changes to its short policy statement. The bank took several steps to support the economy on March 7. Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.

The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4%, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year - if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3% for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8% from a peak of 12.1% in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3% from 3.5%.
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.

BERLIN, April 4 (Reuters) - The new Bauhaus museum opens its doors to the public for the first time in the east German city of Weimar on Saturday after three years of construction, giving admirers of the world-famous "form follows function" aesthetic a new place of pilgrimage.
An inauguration weekend, with free entry and various concerts and spectacles, will mark the peak of a year during which hundreds of events across Germany are commemorating the 100th birthday of the Bauhaus movement, associated with clean and functional design.
"Bauhaus has influenced design all over the world," said Ulrike Bestgen, the museum\'s director, adding that Bauhaus pioneers dealt with urgent issues of their times, like housing shortages which are still relevant today.
Three light and sound installations are set to interact with the new building, which, designed in white and grey by Berlin architect and long-time Bauhaus teacher Heike Hanada, itself recalls the minimalist sobriety of the original style.
The school began in 1919 in the aftermath of World War One. Bauhaus - German for "building house" - pioneered a new restraint as a reaction against the decorative frills of the pre-war era that now seemed frivolous.
The art school later moved from Weimar to Dessau, also in the east, where - once Hitler\'s Nazis moved into the local townhall - the Bauhaus was shut down.
That was in 1933, the year in which Hitler came to power, bringing an end to the "Weimar Republic", a short period of democracy between two World Wars in Germany which also started in 1919 and, like Weimar\'s Bauhaus school, ended 14 years later.

MILAN (AP) - Italy\'s hard-line vice premier is meeting with like-minded leaders of European right-wing party as he seeks to form a broad alliance ahead of the European elections next month.
Matteo Salvini of the the anti-migrant League says that the coalition that he is forming with Marine Le Pen, leader of France\'s far-right National Rally, "will be a great event for Europe for the next 30 years."
Salvini is meeting Monday in Milan with leaders of the Danish People\'s Party, The Finns Party and Alternative for Germany.
Peter Kofod Poulsen, the Danish People\'s Party\'s top candidate for the European Parliament elections, said in a statement that the parties are looking to form a new group of parties with common interests after the European-wide elections next month.


BUCHAREST, April 5 (Reuters) - The European Union economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici said on Friday that Italy\'s economic situation was "delicate" and needed to be monitored closely.
Arriving to a meeting of Euro Zone finance ministers in Bucharest, Moscovici cited non-EU figures pointing to no growth or even recession for Italy. "These are figures that we need to follow very closely," he said.
He added the Commission will issue new economic forecasts on May 7. In its latest estimates released in February, the Commission predicted a 0.2 percent growth for Italy this year.
He said that the new EU forecasts will acknowledge the current economic slowdown that is most affecting Germany and Italy in the 19-country Euro Zone.
Moscovici said that Germany\'s slowdown "may be temporary", while Italy is in recession or close to recession, depending on the institutions that make the forecasts.
"We must be very careful about this situation, but we must not be too alarmist," he said. (Reporting by Francesco Guarascio; Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Rashmi Aich)


Europe\'s domestic leagues, concerned about plans to drastically overhaul football on the continent from 2024, say they will not allow UEFA club competitions to be played at weekends.
The topic, alongside the revenue distribution model for the Champions League and Europa League, is set to dominate discussions when the European Leagues umbrella organisation holds a general assembly in Lisbon on Friday.
UEFA has recently begun discussions with the continent\'s clubs over the format for European competitions from 2024.
The European Leagues umbrella organisation holds a general assembly in Lisbon on Friday
The European Club Association (ECA) has said it wants more teams playing more games in European competition although, after meeting in Amsterdam last week, added that it was too early to give details on what was being planned.
However, the European Leagues are concerned that European soccer\'s governing body UEFA could ultimately give captive places to some bigger clubs and play matches at weekends.
\'We will always protect our weekends. We will not allow European club competition to be played at weekends,\' said European Leagues Deputy General Secretary Alberto Colombo.
\'The passion of football fans is driven by local football and by their tradition to go to the stadium with family and friends on Saturday and Sunday.\'
The\xc2\xa0European Club Association, led by Andrea Agnelli (left), will propose new formats
Colombo added that under the current model the clubs earned places in UEFA club competition by finishing at the top of their respective leagues.
\'If you give the big clubs guaranteed places in UEFA Club Competition and you destroy this model, it will devalue domestic football which drives the passion of fans,\' he said.
European club football runs in three-year cycles with the current one ending in 2021.
The format for the 2021-24 cycle was decided last year with the addition of a new third-tier competition in addition to the Champions League and the Europa League.
However, revenue distribution for the 2021-24 cycle has not been settled and European Leagues are arguing for a greater share of the spoils to be given to the clubs who do not qualify for European competition.
It wants so-called solidarity payments to be increased from the current 7.3 percent to 20 percent in the next cycle.
In a recent statement, the Leagues said it was \'imperative to increase solidarity so as to safeguard the dream of all clubs, and not just a few rich ones, to perform in a fair competitive environment.\' (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)


MILAN, April 9 (Reuters) - Italian payments group Nexi narrowed the price range for its initial public offering (IPO) to between 9.00 euros and 9.50 euros per share, the middle of a previously announced range, one of the deal\'s bookrunners said on Tuesday.
The new price range would give Nexi a market value of up to 6 billion euros ($6.8 billion), making it one of the biggest European IPOs this year.
The initial price range was set last month at between 8.50 and 10.35 euros per share.
Controlled by private equity firms that bought it from a group of Italian banks in 2015, Nexi operates in the fast-growing payments business, which McKinsey expects to reach $3 trillion a year in revenue by 2023 as more people ditch cash.
The bookrunner said the IPO was oversubscribed throughout the price range.
Books for the offer are due to stay open until April 11, with the company\'s market debut expected on April 16.
No early closure of the IPO period is expected, a source familiar with the matter added.
Nexi plans to list up to 43.2 percent of its capital. The company said last month it would use cash from the share sale as well as 1.5 billion euros in fresh financing provided by a group of banks involved in the IPO to reduce debt.

ROME, April 5 (Reuters) - Italy\'s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said on Friday he would host a major rally of European nationalist and far-right parties to promote a shared political vision ahead of May\'s EU parliamentary elections.
Salvini leads the ruling League party and hopes to put together a bloc of like-minded, anti-immigration parties in the European parliament to challenge the traditionally predominant and mainstream centre-left and centre-right groups.
However he has so far struggled to create a broad, sovereignist front in the 28-nation European Union, with a matrix of conflicting national interests hindering his progress.
With time running out, he announced this week he would kick off his campaign for the May 26 vote in Milan on Monday with representatives of just three, relatively small far-right European parties.
But speaking after talks with his longtime French ally Marine Le Pen, Salvini told reporters he planned a much more ambitious election rally next month.
"We\'re preparing a major event for the Europe of the next 30 years in May in Italy, where we\'ll invite all the European movements that are alternatives to the rule of the Socialists and the European People\'s Party of recent years," Salvini said, referring to the EU\'s big leftist and conservative groups.
"It will be the first time an event drawing together at least 15 or 20 European countries will take place in Italy," he told reporters in Paris.
Salvini did not say what other parties had signed up to the initiative, which the League hopes to hold in Rome\'s ancient chariot-racing stadium Circus Maximus.
DIVERGENCE
European parties have created multiple, pan-national groups in the EU parliament, with the League a member of the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF), which includes Le Pen\'s National Rally and Austria\'s Freedom Party of Austria.
Salvini wants to embrace other far-right or nationalist leaders whose parties are in different groups, such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of Poland\'s ruling PiS party.
Kaczynski met Salvini in January, but PiS, which is highly suspicious of the close ties Le Pen and Salvini have forged with Moscow, said on Friday it would not join the May rally.
"We met (Salvini) a few weeks ago and we spelt out our conditions when it comes to the European parliament. We do not envisage any further contact until after the election," said Tomasz Poreba, PiS\'s EU ballot campaign chief.
Making clear its preferences, PiS this week welcomed Salvini\'s old ally, the Brothers of Italy, into its EU group -- the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe.
"We are the real sovereignists. They are populists," Brothers of Italy leader Giorgia Meloni told La Stampa newspaper on Thursday, referring to the League. "I don\'t think Salvini\'s project is very clear about what it wants with Europe."
Salvini said the three groups that would be joining him on Monday were the anti-euro Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, the conservative Finns Party and the Danish People\'s Party.
AfD co-leader Joerg Meuthen told La Stampa newspaper on Friday that although he and Salvini had similar, anti-immigrant views, they had different positions on key economic questions, like the need to respect EU fiscal rules.
"We cannot agree on everything. We will talk about it and find compromises," he was quoted as saying. (Additional reporting by Gavin Jones in Rome, Michel Rose and Simon Carraud in Paris and Pawel Florkiewicz in Warsaw, Editing by William Maclean)


DUBAI, April 11 (Reuters) - State-owned Qatar Airways on Thursday dismissed concerns its 49 percent stake in Air Italy breaches a 2018 aviation agreement between the United States and Qatar, designed to address U.S. concerns that Gulf airlines had an unfair competitive advantage.
The U.S is "looking very closely" at the deal after Republicans and Democrats said on Wednesday they were concerned it violated the agreement.
Qatar Airways bought a stake in Italian airline Meridiana in 2017, rebranded it Air Italy and transformed it into a carrier with five announced non-stop U.S. destinations from Milan.
Qatar Airways said the stake was "fully compliant" with the 2018 U.S.-Qatar Understandings, an additional pact that accompanied the U.S-Qatar Open Skies agreement.
Since 2015 the largest U.S carriers - Delta Air Lines , American Airlines Group and United Airlines - have argued their Gulf rivals are being unfairly subsidized by their governments, distorting competition.
Gulf airlines have always denied those accusations and last year separate voluntary agreements were reached between the U.S. and Qatar, and the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates to address the concerns. Measures included the airlines not adding new flights to the U.S.
However, Air Italy has been flying to New York and Miami since June last year and was due to start serving San Francisco and Los Angeles from this month and Chicago in May.
Qatar Airways said in a statement its investment in Air Italy, which closed in September 2017, preceded the 2018 agreement but complied with it.
It said its investments in other airlines were not raised as a point of concern during the discussions that led to the 2018 agreement and that the deal does not mention or prohibit cross-border investments.
Qatar Airways also said it did not codeshare on Air Italy\'s flights to the U.S. and has no plans to do so. (Reporting by Alexander Cornwell Editing by Alexandra Hudson)


BERLIN (AP) - Germany\'s Foreign Ministry has protested Brunei\'s plans to implement Islamic criminal laws that punishes gay sex by stoning offenders to death.
In a statement Tuesday, the ministry said German diplomats expressed concern at the introduction of Sharia law penalties and appealed to Brunei\'s ambassador Monday to "abide by existing international human rights obligations."
The legal change in the tiny, oil-rich monarchy, which also includes amputation for theft, is due to come into force Wednesday.
Human rights group Amnesty International has slammed the punishments as "vicious ."
American actor George Clooney, who is married to prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, called recently for a boycott of luxury hotels in Europe and the United States linked to Brunei\'s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.

April 2 (Reuters) - European shares hit their highest in half a year on Tuesday, buoyed by autos and insurance stocks and gains among export-heavy London stocks as Brexit uncertainty weakened the pound.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index gained for a third straight day, hitting 385.68 - its highest since late September. It later gave up some gains, but ended up 0.4 percent.
"The resurgence in risk appetite looks to have legs, supported by stronger (or at least less bad) economic data, and any short-term weakness should probably be resolved in favor of the bulls in due course," Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, wrote in a note.
The index of automakers and parts suppliers rose 1.3 percent, building on Monday\'s 3.3 percent gain which came after unexpectedly strong Chinese factory data.
German auto parts supplier Continental AG climbed 2.3 percent, and said it was sticking to plans list its powertrain division.
Tire-maker Pirelli rose 2.9 percent after the Italian firm said it saw a 107 million euros first-half boost from Brazilian tax credits.
European insurers gained 0.9 percent, propped up by London-listed names such as Prudential PLC and Old Mutual Ltd, which both rose at least 2.9 percent.
The pound slid as Britain moved towards potentially leaving the European Union on April 12 without a orderly withdrawal deal or alternatively perhaps an election, pushing up stocks of UK firms with significant overseas earnings.
The FTSE 100 climbed 1 percent to finish at a six month-closing high.
"The FTSE has been the big outperformer today, as fears over a no-deal Brexit drag the pound lower," Joshua Mahony, Senior Market Analyst at IG, wrote in a note.
European banks rose 0.7 percent, with Swedbank AB jumping 6.1 percent in its best one-day showing in more than six years.
The Swedish lender\'s stock has bounced back almost 10 percent this week after hitting a more than six year low on Friday on its alleged involvement in a money laundering scandal that led to the departure of its chief executive.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) - Coal-powered plants, mobile networks, major bridges, roads and railways: Chinese investments have been booming throughout Central and Eastern Europe\'s cash-strapped developing countries, even as European Union officials scramble to counter Beijing\'s mounting economic and political influence on the continent.
EU member Croatia is hosting a summit Thursday between China and 16 regional countries - the 8th so far - that focuses on expanding business and other links between China and the region, which Beijing sees as a gateway into Europe.
The gathering in Dubrovnik of the so-called 16+1 initiative consists of Central and Eastern European countries that have endorsed China\'s ambitious global "Belt and Road" investment project, which has triggered concerns among some key EU states about increased Chinese political and economic clout in the region.
China has already invested billions of dollars in various infrastructure projects in Central and Eastern Europe. Western leaders worry that further investment in the states that are EU members - or those hoping to join - could mean lower environmental and other standards than those in the rest of the bloc.
Thorny issues include the flouting of EU competition rules, potential over-borrowing by some of the states, the quality of constructions, and security concerns over high-speed 5G network technology supplied by Chinese companies. Critics also say that in return for allowing Chinese expansion into the region, Beijing should give better reciprocal access for European companies to Chinese markets.
Top Chinese officials have sought to alleviate EU fears of unfair competition from Chinese state-controlled companies, which benefit from the government\'s financial backing. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a recent visit to Paris to work with European leaders to seek fairer international trade rules.

Of the 16 participating countries - Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia - 11 are EU member states, and the remaining five want to join.
Beijing has marketed its expanding initiative as a way to give some of Europe\'s neediest countries a financial boost, helping them gain access to more trade and investment. That has been mostly welcomed by the Central and Eastern European nations.
Linda Tjia, an expert on Chinese development strategy at the City University of Hong Kong, said there is no evidence to support concerns that Beijing is harboring "neo-colonial" goals to exploit Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing economies.
European leaders "have to somehow show their people they are trying to protect national interests," Tija said.
Major Chinese-led infrastructure projects in the region include a planned high-speed railway from the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to Belgrade in neighboring Serbia. The line will link up with the Chinese- controlled port of Piraeus in Greece as an entry point for Chinese goods to Central and Eastern Europe.
The project has drawn scrutiny from the EU because Chinese state-owned banks would provide financing, and Chinese companies would supply technology and the actual building. That conflicts with EU rules requiring public works to be broken into segments small enough to attract multiple bidders.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose own government often has been criticized for anti-democratic policies, says Hungary\'s relations with China should be based on "mutual respect."
Hungary last year did not sign an EU report criticizing China\'s human rights record and business policies.
In Serbia, an EU membership candidate, Chinese companies are building major bridges and highways. They are also constructing a large coal-powered electricity plant even as China is trying to curb pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of lignite, by far the most polluting fossil fuel.
Serbian analyst Mijat Lakicevic said the strategically-located Balkan country situated between East and West is a perfect place where "China can realize its economic concept, the way it wants to enter (Eastern European) markets," without much concern over fair bidding processes or pollution standards.
Bosnia, a potential EU candidate, is at odds with the bloc over its decision to issue a public guarantee for a 600-million euro ($676 million) loan from China\'s Export-Import Bank to expand Bosnia\'s largest coal-fired power plant.
EU\'s energy watchdog has warned that the move could eventually harm Bosnia\'s bid to join the EU because the agreement violates EU\'s subsidy and environment rules. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn has said the issue "raises serious questions" about the Balkan country\'s "commitment to international treaties (and) European rules."
Chinese companies are also involved in the construction of a $380-million Peljesac bridge in Croatia, which links two coastal parts over the Adriatic Sea, as well as a highway linking the Adriatic in Montenegro to neighboring Serbia.
In the Czech Republic, the National Cyber and Information Security Agency followed U.S. authorities\' warning against the use of hardware or software made by Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. That, however, did not change Czech President Milos Zeman\'s positive stance toward Huawei.
Zeman publicly criticized the Czech watchdog, saying it harms the Czech Republic\'s business interests as it could affect Huawei\'s plan to invest $370 million in 5G networks in the Czech Republic.
U.S. officials mounted an international campaign to keep Huawei gear out of any foreign 5G network that might carry sensitive U.S. intelligence.

MILAN, April 11 (Reuters) - Italian payment group Nexi\'s initial public offering has been priced at 9 euros per share in a 2 billion euro deal set to be one of Europe\'s biggest IPOs this year, sources close to the process said.
The price was set by the banks working on the listing and is subject to approval by a Nexi board meeting later on Thursday. It was at the bottom end of a price range that had narrowed to between 9.0 euros and 9.5 euros.
The offer will give the company a market value of around 5.7 billion euros ($6.4 billion) ahead of its market debut on Tuesday.
Nexi declined to comment.
The initial price range had been set in March at between 8.50 and 10.35 euros per share.
Controlled by private equity firms Bain Capital, Advent and Clessidra, Nexi is an incumbent in the fast-growing payments business which faces competition from newcomers tapping new technologies for alternative payment methods.
The private equity owners will reduce their combined 94 percent holding to 56.5 percent by listing existing shares.
Nexi, which plans to list up to 43.2 percent of its capital, is also selling new shares in the offer to the tune of 700 million euros.
It will use proceeds from the share sale to cut debt to a projected 1.7 billion euros after deducting the costs of the IPO and the capital increase.

A model\xc2\xa0convicted for attempting to smuggle\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa31million of heroin from Pakistan to Ireland has today filed a court appeal to have her sentence overturned.
Tereza Hluskova was sentenced to eight years and eight months in prison last month\xc2\xa0in the eastern city of Lahore, the capital of Punjab province.\xc2\xa0
The 22-year-old\xc2\xa0Czech model was arrested in possession of 19 lbs (8.5kg) of heroin in January 2018 at Lahore\xe2\x80\x99s Allama Iqbal International Airport.\xc2\xa0
Tereza Hluskova, 22, from the Czech Republic, has launched an appeal against her eight-year prison sentence for drug smuggling
Hluskova was caught attempting to smuggle \xc2\xa31million of heroin from Pakistan to Ireland
Czech model Tereza Hluskova broke down in tears last month as she was sentenced to prison
She was heading to Ireland via Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the court said.\xc2\xa0
In her appeal filed to the Lahore High Court, Hluskova has requested that her sentence is overturned because \'it negated the true facts of the case\'.
Hluskova has claimed that she came to Pakistan to work as a model and that someone put narcotics into her luggage.\xc2\xa0
Hluskova wept after she was handed the sentence in the eastern city of Lahore, the capital of Punjab province\xc2\xa0
The story gained attention when Hluskova was captured smiling and posing for photos with Pakistani investigators after she was arrested at the airport
Previous reports said Hluskova was stopped with a haul of the Class A drug stashed in \'statues\' in her luggage.

Two other men were also arrested and were due to face drug trafficking charges after police went through the model\'s phone.\xc2\xa0
In a video, released online, a Pakistani customs official is shown \'discovering\' the drugs hidden in the suitcase while Hluskova looks on. She then puts her head in her hands.
Hluskova said strangers approached her and put ornaments in her luggage and that she had no idea they were full of drugs
In November last year, a man was jailed for three years after he threatened terrorist attacks on Pakistan if Hluskova (pictured) was not released\xc2\xa0
She says in the video: \'They gave me something for luggage, three statues or something. They said it was gifts. I didn\'t know there was something inside\'.
In November last year, a man was jailed for three years after he threatened terrorist attacks on Pakistan if Hluskova was not released.
Nikolai Simeonov Ivanov, 21, from Bulgaria, sent threatening emails and text messages to a news website in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0
Ivanov admitted that he did not realise the consequences of sending the threats, a court heard.


European leaders are poised to grant Theresa May a longer extension to Britain\xe2\x80\x99s membership of the EU than she will request at a crunch summit in Brussels on Wednesday evening.
The Prime Minister is set to repeat her call to delay Brexit until June 30, with the possibility of an earlier departure if the UK\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal deal is ratified.
But European Council president Donald Tusk suggested on the eve of the summit that EU leaders grant the UK a longer extension of up to one year.
Mr Tusk, in a letter to the heads of the 27 remaining member states, said there was \xe2\x80\x9clittle reason to believe\xe2\x80\x9d that the ratification of Mrs May\xe2\x80\x99s beleaguered Brexit deal could be completed by the end of June.
He called for the European Council to discuss an alternative, longer extension, such as a \xe2\x80\x9cflexible extension\xe2\x80\x9d lasting \xe2\x80\x9cas long as necessary and no longer than one year\xe2\x80\x9d.
Mr Tusk wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cThe flexibility would allow to terminate the extension automatically, as soon as both sides have ratified the Withdrawal Agreement.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe UK would be free to leave whenever it is ready. And the EU27 would avoid repeated Brexit summits.
\xe2\x80\x9cImportantly, a long extension would provide more certainty and predictability by removing the threat of constantly shifting cliff-edge dates.
There are times when you need to give time time.
My letter to EU leaders ahead of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s #EUCO: https://t.co/bAsz4Qx36s#Brexit \xe2\x80\x94 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) April 9, 2019
\xe2\x80\x9cFurthermore, in the event of a continued stalemate, such a longer extension would allow the UK to rethink its Brexit strategy.\xe2\x80\x9d
Mr Tusk also warned that \xe2\x80\x9cneither side should be allowed to feel humiliated at any stage in this difficult process\xe2\x80\x9d.
It follows Mrs May\xe2\x80\x99s whistle-stop tour on Tuesday of European capitals for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin.
DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds branded the talks \xe2\x80\x9chumiliating and embarrassing\xe2\x80\x9d for the UK, and claimed Britain was \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively holding out a begging bowl to European leaders\xe2\x80\x9d.
The unanimous agreement of all 27 remaining EU states is needed to avoid a no-deal Brexit on the scheduled date of Friday, April 12.
On Tuesday evening MPs approved a Government motion for Mrs May to seek an extension to June 30 by 420 votes to 110, majority 310.
However, 97 Conservatives rebelled by opposing the plan \xe2\x80\x93 including former Brexit secretaries David Davis and Dominic Raab.
Mrs May will face the Commons for Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s Questions on Wednesday afternoon before she heads to Brussels where she is expected to meet Mr Tusk ahead of the summit.
EU leaders will then gather for talks with European Parliament president Antonio Tajani, before hearing from Mrs May.
They will then meet for dinner without her to agree a response to the UK\xe2\x80\x99s extension request.
A press conference with Mrs May is likely to be held after the summit, and the PM is expected to update MPs on Thursday.
Meanwhile in Westminster, Labour claimed the Government had not yet made a \xe2\x80\x9cclear shift\xe2\x80\x9d in its position in cross-party talks designed to break the impasse. Discussions will resume on Thursday.


MILAN (AP) - The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says it is asking Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a safe port for the 64 migrants it rescued off Libya earlier this week.
Sea-Watch spokesman Carlotta Weibl said Friday that the rescue boat Alan Kurdi remains in international waters off Lampedusa and will not approach Italy\'s southernmost island until it has permission.
She said conditions on board were worsening and that a storm was approaching. She said a request has been made to the German foreign ministry to find a solution.
Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers to pack unseaworthy rubber dinghies with migrants looking for sanctuary in Europe.

Alfredo Morelos is the man with the shortest fuse in football and was sent off yet again for Rangers in their Old Firm defeat by Celtic on Sunday.\xc2\xa0
The irate Colombian can be depended on to explode at the merest hint of provocation and reacted to a slight bump by Scott Brown by elbowing him straight in the face.\xc2\xa0
Steven Gerrard was left shaking his head in dismay and after seeing the striker walk prematurely down the tunnel for the fifth time this season, said he couldn\'t defend him anymore.\xc2\xa0
Alfredo Morelos (centre) was shown a fifth red card this season for his elbow on Scott Brown
The Colombian, sent off here in Agusust against Aberdeen, now holds the European record
There are a number of statistics that shame Morelos and put his ludicrous diciplinary record under the spotlight.\xc2\xa0
He currently has more red cards than any other team in the Scottish Premiership this season.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
In fact, the combustable 22-year-old\'s five dismissals is more than there were in the entire World Cup in Russia last year (4).\xc2\xa0
Morelos prides himself on being a ferocious competitor but his emotion regularly spills over
When you consider that 736 players were in action at the tournament, his indiscipline is even more staggering.\xc2\xa0
He also now has the dubious honour of breaking the European record for the most red cards in one campaign.\xc2\xa0
The fifth meant he overtook team-mate Ryan Jack, though two of his four were recinded, and notoriously fiery Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
In 27 matches this season, Morelos has 17 goals, four assists nine yellow cards and five reds.\xc2\xa0
Morelos has been Rangers\' best player this season but also let Steven Gerrard down
The striker can be easily wound up by opponents and they deliberately antagonise him
Having left his side battling with ten men against Celtic on Sunday, in a game they eventually lost 2-1, Morelos is now facing a four game suspension.\xc2\xa0
By the time he has served the ban, he will have missed a grand total of ten matches including 4 hours 13 minutes of game time in the matches he\'s been sent off in.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Given his undeniable ability as Rangers\' main goal threat, their season could have gone entirely differently if he\'d managed to temper his aggression.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0


A Belfast actor has paid tribute to a US TV giant\xc2\xa0for bringing its biggest show to the region.
Ian Beattie, who played the unpopular Ser Meryn Trant on the HBO drama Game Of Thrones, said the positive effect of the show on Northern Ireland is beyond calculation.
He described it as tremendous fun to play the villainous knight although conceded it became harder in later seasons where he was faced with scenes including one where he had to attack Sophie Turner\xe2\x80\x99s character Sansa Stark at the behest of King Joffrey.

\xe2\x80\x9cHe was probably the most unsuitable member of the Kingsguard ever, he was a thug, a coward, a bully and honestly he had no redeeming features whatsoever,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.
Beattie was faced with wearing a coat of armour for the role which he weighed as being 28kg.
\xe2\x80\x9cBut the lovely thing about it is the stunning detailing, and when you put it on, it really helped you with the character you were playing, you just became the character.\xe2\x80\x9d
Speaking to the Press Association at the launch of the Game Of Thrones touring exhibition at the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast,\xc2\xa0Beattie went on to pay tribute to HBO.
\xe2\x80\x9cGame Of Thrones has transformed so much in this province, we have so much to be grateful for, that HBO decided to bring this show here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a new tourist attraction, loads of them, our own beautiful coastline which plays host to many of the scenes in the TV show, the positive effect on our economy to have a major American TV series being filmed here, the training of our crews, our camera people in front of and behind the camera, our artisans, our plasterers, our painters, the hotel trade, everything.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe trickle down effect of Game Of Thrones has been incalculable.\xe2\x80\x9d


What to watch in the leading soccer leagues in Europe this weekend:
ITALY
Cristiano Ronaldo is likely to win his first trophy with Juventus this weekend.
Juventus needs just a point at relegation-threatened Spal on Saturday to secure a record-extending eighth straight Italian league title.
It is 20 points clear of second-place Napoli and has a better head-to-head record, which is the tiebreaker in Italy.
Juventus would become the first Italian club to clinch the title with six matches to spare. The previous record of five matches was set by Torino in 1947-48 and matched by Fiorentina in 1955-56 and Inter Milan in 2006-07.

AC Milan hosts Lazio on Saturday in a match crucial to both teams\' ambitions of qualifying for the Champions League.
Milan is in the fourth and final qualifying position but is above Atalanta based on its superior head-to-head record.
Roma is a point further back, while Lazio is three points below Milan but has played one less game.

FRANCE
Paris Saint-Germain gets a second chance to wrap up the French league title.
The defending champions travel to second-place Lille on Sunday with a 20-point lead over its opponent. A win for PSG will to clinch a sixth title in seven years with seven games to spare.
PSG was widely expected to beat Strasbourg on Sunday at the Parc des Princes but instead dropped its first points at home this season in a 2-2 draw.
With Neymar and Edinson Cavani still injured, PSG coach Thomas Tuchel is expected to put forward Kylian Mbappe back in the team.
Third-place Lyon will hope for a PSG win so the fight for the second automatic Champions League qualifying place can be rekindled. Lyon can reduce its five-point deficit to Lille by winning at Nantes on Friday.

ENGLAND
Chelsea\'s trip to title-chasing Liverpool in the Premier League revives memories of the same fixture at Anfield five years ago, when the home team\'s aspirations of becoming English champion were damaged irreparably.
In 2014, Liverpool hosted Chelsea knowing a win would have put the team six points clear with two games remaining. A first league title since 1990 was in its grasp.
But after a slip from Steven Gerrard that led to Chelsea\'s first goal, Liverpool lost 2-0 and finished two points behind Manchester City.
Once again, it is City challenging Liverpool for the title. And once again, City will hope Chelsea can pull off a victory at Anfield.
City, which plays Crystal Palace hours before the Liverpool-Chelsea game on Sunday, is two points behind Liverpool but has a game in hand. The defending champion, City has a tougher run-in that includes games against Tottenham and Manchester United.

SPAIN
Barcelona gets something of a break this weekend as it closes in on the Spanish league title.
After defeating Atletico Madrid last weekend to open up an 11-point lead, and then beating Manchester United in the Champions League on Tuesday, Barca travels to last-place Huesca on Saturday in La Liga.
Barca coach Ernesto Valverde is expected to rest many of the team\'s starters following the two big matches.
While Barcelona is unbeaten in 17 matches in all competitions and hasn\'t been defeated in the league since November, Huesca has lost 17 of its 31 league matches so far and won only one of its last eight games.
Playing in the first division for the first time, Huesca was routed 8-2 by Barcelona in the teams\' first meeting. It is six points from safety with seven matches remaining.
Atletico Madrid, trying to hold on to second place, hosts Celta Vigo, which is attempting to escape relegation, on Saturday. Third-place Real Madrid, which is two points behind its city rival, visits Leganes on Monday.
- By Tales Azzoni
GERMANY
Bayern Munich heads into a match against Fortuna Duesseldorf with a one-point lead over Borussia Dortmund in the German league with six rounds remaining.
Bayern and Dortmund have exchanged the lead five times this season, and Bayern is the latest to be in front after a 5-0 win over Dortmund last weekend.
But Fortuna could provide Bayern with a stern test on Sunday after having virtually assured Bundesliga survival with a 2-1 win at Hertha Berlin last weekend. It has claimed 28 points from its last 14 games and only three other teams have done better.
Dortmund hosts Mainz on Saturday, with coach Lucien Favre saying he will try to "relax the team so they rediscover the fun in football."

Rodrigo Alves\' song Plastic World was released on Friday, and has already climbed the charts to reach number one in Dubai and Italy.
The\xc2\xa0Human Ken Doll, 35, recorded the song with his plastic surgeon\xc2\xa0Giancome Urtis, and within hours of its release on Friday it reached the top of the Electronica and Dance charts in both countries.
He exclusively told MailOnline: \'This is such a big day for me! I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe that that my song in top chart and number one already in few countries !\xc2\xa0The launch is today and the positive people\xe2\x80\x99s response to it is overwhelming !\xc2\xa0

Explaining the song, which is available in both English and Spanish, is based on his life, Roddy added that he\'s set to promote the song in Dubai with night club events, a Eurovision party, and during an appearance on Virgin Radio with Cris Fade.
He continued: \'I have just finished a pool party event today and people were going crazy with plastic world! I promise that this year I will make people sing and dance alongside me like a rock star!\'
Roddy is also set to film part of his music video while travelling in Dubai, before then going on to the\xc2\xa0Cine Citta in Rome to finish off filming.\xc2\xa0

MOSCOW (AP) - The European Court of Human Rights ruled Tuesday that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
Navalny, a prominent opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed the ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities. It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 20,000 euros ($22,550) in damages.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict to the court\'s highest chamber.
It\'s the second time that the court has ruled against Russia in a matter of months. Last November, the court\'s highest chamber found that Russian authorities violated multiple human rights in detaining Navalny seven times from 2012 to 2014, and that two of the arrests were expressly aimed at "suppressing political pluralism."
It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 63,000 euros in damages, and called on Russia to fix legislation to "take due regard of the fundamental importance of the right to peaceful assembly."
Russia is obliged to carry out the court\'s rulings, which enforce the European Convention on Human Rights, but it has delayed implementing past rulings from the court and argued against them as encroaching on Russian judicial sovereignty.


She has moved to Italy for a year with her husband Peter Lewis and four children.
And although radio host Kate Langbroek has been enjoying the good life since relocating, she revealed Peter had a far more gruesome experience after falling from his bike this week.\xc2\xa0
Taking to Instagram on Wednesday, the HIT radio host, 53, shared a photo of his severely grazed upper thigh where the skin had been left raw.
Ouch! Kate Langbroek has revealed her husband\'s horrific injury obtained during her family\'s \'gap year\' in Italy after he came off his bike and stripped the skin off his thigh\xc2\xa0
\'My husband came off his bicycle,\' Kate told her followers.
In the photo, her spouse is wearing just his boxer shorts and the full scale of the injury is clear - with the skin appearing to have been torn off in two directions.
His shins didn\'t escape unscathed either, with a number of bloody scratches visible in the photograph.
The graphic injury drew sympathy with the radio host\'s celebrity friends, including The Project host Carrie Bickmore.\xc2\xa0
Peter\'s unfortunate accident isn\'t the only mishap to befall him since moving to Europe.
Kate revealed Peter surprised her with tickets to her favourite comedian, Bill Burr, who was performing in nearby Amsterdam.\xc2\xa0
However, as Kate told listeners on\xc2\xa0Hughesy & Kate last month, Peter got more than he bargained for when he bought two overpriced tickets for 440 euros (AU$706) each.
Uh-oh! Peter\'s (pictured with Kate) unfortunate accident isn\'t the only mishap to befall him since moving to Europe. He was also ripped off when he bought tickets to a show on\xc2\xa0Viagogo\xc2\xa0
Recalling the story to her co-host Dave Hughes, Kate explained that her husband had purchased the tickets through online ticket reselling site, Viagogo.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Kate, Peter and their children Lewis, 15, Sunday, 13, Artie, 12, and Jannie, nine, have been enjoying the Italian city of Bologna since moving from Melbourne in January.
Just days prior to relocating overseas, Kate appeared on The Project to admit she had \'no idea\' why she was doing it.
Jetsetters: Kate, Peter and their children Lewis, 15, Sunday, 13, Artie, 12, and Jannie, nine have been enjoying the Italian city of Bologna since moving from Melbourne in January\xc2\xa0
Kate confessed: \'I can\'t tell you why because I\'ve got NFI [no f**king idea].\'
She added: \'But at the time it seemed like a good idea that we would take our four children and go to live in Italy for a year.
\'Why? I don\'t know. I\'m hanging by a thread.\'

FRANKFURT, April 10 (Reuters) - Europe\'s banking sector is overcrowded and in significant need of consolidation, ECB President Mario Draghi said on Wednesday.
The sector needs to take a series of actions to improve its business model, he told a post-policy-meeting news conference.
"That can be achieved however only through consolidation.... (and) the need for consolidation is very, very significant," he said.
"There is a relationship between scale and the capacity to undertake the investments that are needed to improve technology and be competitive, especially in certain business models."
Asked about the European Central Bank\'s supervisory role in mergers, he said the main priority was for transactions to be successful, meaning pleasing to shareholders and creating a strong business entity.
He also said the bank had no preference between cross-border and national banking mergers. (Writing by John Stonestreet; Editing by Hugh Lawson)


April 4 (Reuters) - European stocks took a breather on Thursday after hitting an eight-month high in the previous session, with banking mergers in focus while investors awaited more developments in U.S.-China trade talks.
At 0720 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.4 percent, having risen more than 3 percent climb in the previous four sessions on hopes that a U.S.-China trade deal could be imminent after both sides reported progress.
Commerzbank shares rose 3 percent as the race to acquire the German lender heated up. The Financial Times reported that Italy\'s UniCredit was preparing a bid as Deutsche Bank\'s attempt faces obstacles.
The FT said UniCredit was unlikely to gatecrash current merger negotiations with Deutsche but might make a move if these fell apart.
The news is likely to rekindle expectations of further consolidation in the battered European banking sector, which has underperformed the STOXX 600 this year. It was also among leading decliners on Thursday.
Britain\'s exporter-heavy FTSE 100 continued to be pressured by a rise in sterling, boosted by hopes of progress or at least a longer Brexit delay as Prime Minister Theresa May seeks a joint approach with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to end a parliamentary deadlock.
Dampening sentiment was data out of Germany that showed an unexpected drop in industrial orders in February, hit by a slump in foreign demand.
Saga Plc shares crashed nearly 40 percent, on course for its worst daily performance, after the over-50s tourism and insurance firm forecast lower annual underlying pretax profit and cut its dividend as it struggles to keep up in a competitive motor and home insurance sector.
Steel maker Thyssenkrupp fell 1.5 percent as workers demanded substantial guarantees for jobs and plants even if a planned joint venture with India\'s Tata Steel falls apart.
Novartis dipped after an influential non-profit organisation said the $4 million to $5 million value put on a course of its experimental gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is excessive.
Among bright spots was the British home repairs provider HomeServe Plc, which led gains on the STOXX after forecasting full-year adjusted pretax profit at the upper end of market expectations. (Reporting by Medha Singh and Agamoni Ghosh in Bengaluru; Editing by Kevin Liffey)


Ryanair has been forced to apologise after refusing to let a prominent refugee board a flight to Ireland this morning.
Iyad El-Baghdadi, an Arab Spring activist raised in the UAE, was told he wasn\'t allowed on the flight from Berlin to Dublin on Wednesday despite having the correct travel documents.\xc2\xa0
The refugee obtained\xc2\xa0political asylum in Norway in 2015 and had a Norwegian\xc2\xa0travel papers when he was turned away from the 10.30am flight this morning.
Arab Spring activist Iyad El-Baghdadi was told he wasn\'t allowed on the flight from Berlin to Dublin on Wednesday despite having the correct travel documents
Baghdadi tweeted to his 122,000 followers to \'make some noise\' about the incident
He said Ryanair denied him boarding \'for no reason\' and told him the supervisor was too busy to deal with the problem.\xc2\xa0
Baghdadi tweeted to his\xc2\xa0122,000 followers to \'make some noise\' about the incident.\xc2\xa0
Ryanair apologised following this backlash. The Irish airline said in a statement to MailOnline: \'This customer was denied boarding because of an error made by our handling agent in Berlin.\xc2\xa0
\'Ryanair has since made contact with the customer directly and he will travel with us later today. We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused.\'\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Ryanair apologised following this backlash - but Baghdadi said he worries about refugees who don\'t have a social media following
Baghdadi later revealed he\'d been contacted by the airline and was being compensated.\xc2\xa0
But he tweeted: \'I\'m thinking about all the refugees who do NOT have 122k followers on Twitter and don\'t get such callbacks.\'
Refugees from outside the EU are allowed entry into Ireland for short stays of up to 90 days if they have travel documents issued by a European member state.


He believes a refreshing break will be conducive to European qualification
Nuno Espirito Santo will take Wolves on a warm-weather training break to Marbella for a final recharge of batteries ahead of attempts to qualify for Europe via the Premier League.
Wolves lost their chance to make the Europa League through the FA Cup after being beaten by Watford in Sunday\'s Wembley semi-final but the club are determined to finish the season strongly.
Nuno has taken his team to the Spanish resort before, most recently in February in between an FA Cup replay against Shrewsbury and a Monday night match with Newcastle, and he places value on a change of scenery getting the best from his players.
Nuno Espirito Santo is preparing to take Wolves on a training break to Marbella next week
In an itinerary that has been in the diary for a month, the Wolves squad and staff will fly out immediately after facing Southampton at St Mary\'s on Saturday and then spend five days training and bonding in sunnier climes.\xc2\xa0
After returning on Thursday next week, Wolves host Brighton at Molineux on Easter Saturday, with four further games against Arsenal, Watford, Fulham and Liverpool.
Nuno wants his players in peak shape for the run-in, with a target of finishing seventh achievable.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
He believes a refreshing break will be conducive to Europa League qualification
That would lead to a Europa League place should Manchester City beat Watford in the FA Cup final.\xc2\xa0
Wolves are currently eighth, behind Leicester on goal difference only and with a game in hand.
Nuno took his team to Marbella in February and they were subsequently able to pull of famous wins over Manchester United, while also securing a draw at Chelsea.\xc2\xa0
Wolves lost their chance to qualify through the FA Cup after losing to Watford at Wembley, and the squad will fly to Marbella after facing Southampton at St Mary\'s on Saturday
The trip is also expected to provide comfort after the bruising way victory slipped from their grasp against Javi Gracia\'s team.
Nuno said: \'Now is a moment we have to suffer together. Let\'s look at it and try to improve. We have to face it. Nothing we can say or do now will change it.
\'We have to stick together, know it will be hard, but let\'s look at the future and still to go for it. Specifically we have to become a better team. There is more to come.\'

April 11 (Reuters) - European shares slipped on Thursday as comments from the U.S. and European central banks added to concerns about the risks of a slowdown in global growth, but strong gains by LVMH boosted luxury goods stocks and buoyed equities in France.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.2 percent by 0907 GMT, led by declines in Milan and Madrid, but Paris rose 0.3 percent.
The European Central Bank stood pat on borrowing rates on Wednesday and said threats to global economic growth remained, while the U.S. Federal Reserve reiterated its patient stance on similar grounds, citing risks from an unresolved trade dispute with China and potentially, Europe.
"At least on (the) part of the ECB, they seem to be slightly less certain on their outlook that (growth) will rebound but they are still hoping this," said Bas van Geffen, a quantitative analyst ECB at Rabobank.
"The question is to what extent are markets going to see this as indeed \'low rates for longer\' and, if so, how concerned are they on the growth cautions."
Ireland\'s ISEQ stock index was flat after the European Union gave British Prime Minister Theresa May until October to leave the bloc, but the lack of clarity on when, how or even if Brexit will happen, kept a lid on gains.
ASML was one of the biggest drags on the pan-region index after a media report said Chinese employees stole corporate secrets from the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker, resulting in hundreds of millions of euros (dollars) in losses. ASML, in response, said that a U.S. software subsidiary was the victim of corporate theft several years ago, but denied that the information stolen was a blueprint for its lithography machines.
German silicon wafer maker Siltronic fell 2.1 percent after Credit Suisse cut its target price for the company by 12 euros.
Material stocks lost 1.2 percent with mining majors BHP and Rio Tinto, tracking a decline in iron ore and copper prices.
Utilities were dragged 1 percent lower, with Engie down 1.8 percent after Morgan Stanley downgraded it to "equal-weight" from "overweight" as it sees headwinds in 2019.
Prysmian shed more than 8.5 percent and was among the biggest percentage decliners on the STOXX 600 as the Italian cable maker said it would review its financial results for last year.
On the other hand, LVMH surged to an all-time high, up 4 percent after sales growth at the luxury goods conglomerate picked up pace in the first quarter.
Other luxury good stocks such as Kering, Christian Dior, Moncler and Burberry also climbed.
Sodexo jumped 5.4 percent after the French food services group reported a stronger-than-expected rise in first-half revenues as growth accelerated in North America during the second quarter.
EssilorLuxottica SA was also among the biggest boosts as Citigroup upgraded shares of the world\'s largest eyewear maker to "neutral".

PRAGUE, April 10 (Reuters) - It\'s the kind of maneuvering that might make the Game of Thrones\' shrewdest operator Tyrion Lannister feel right at home.
As streaming giants Amazon, Netflix and Hulu prepare to splash out on their next fantasy blockbusters and dystopian dramas, Central European countries are slugging it out to get a grab a slice of their bumper production budgets.
Experienced crews, lower labor costs and generous production incentives have long attracted international filmmakers to the Czech Republic and Hungary but other countries in the region are now getting into the game.
The Czechs and Hungarians are both considering raising their incentives after Romania approved a production rebate of up to 45 percent in 2018 and Poland introduced a 30 percent cash rebate in February to keep pace with its neighbors.
A new European Union directive due to come in this year is also expected to spur investment as it will require video-on-demand platforms selling to European audiences to ensure at least 30 percent of their catalogs are European works.
"This is a new era," said Agnes Havas, chief executive of the Hungarian Film Fund told Reuters, noting that the Netflix series "The Crown" and Amazon Prime Video\'s "Hanna" were shot in Hungary.
"What we see is we started at 30 percent (incentives) and now we are looking at the other countries in Europe and we will evaluate the situation and see whether we should potentially think about raising it again in the future."
BITG media analyst Rich Greenfield estimates Amazon will spend $5 billion to $6 billion in 2019 on content with Netflix laying out about $15 billion - and a significant portion of the Netflix budget will flow overseas.
"We are aware there is a shift in global production and you can\'t ignore the big streaming companies," Anna Dziedzic of the Film Commission Poland told Reuters. In 2018 Netflix filmed "1983" in the country, the company\'s first original Polish Netflix series.
"They are one of the biggest players now. You have to adjust to the changing environment and you have to have them in mind," Dziedzic told Reuters.
Amazon and Netflix declined to comment on their plans in the region.
GAME OF THRONES EFFECT
A landscape dotted with castles and rolling countryside makes central Europe a versatile setting for increasingly popular historical and fantasy shows looking to cash in on the success of series such as "Game of Thrones."
"The types of shows being shot have dramatically changed," said David Minkowski, head of production at Stillking Films, which co-produced Amazon\'s neo-noir fantasy "Carnival Row" and Hulu\'s historical series "Das Boot," in the Czech Republic.
"Call it the Game of Thrones effect. A lot of it is fantasy or historical that naturally gravitates to this part of the world," he told Reuters, adding that the company was now working on fantasy drama "The Witcher" for Netflix. "The typical production centers are bursting at the seams."
Dziedzic at the Film Commission Poland said she has also received requests from international companies wanting to use post-Soviet locations and brutalist Communist architecture for science fiction series.
This has helped push international investment in regional production to record highs, leaving studios booked a year in advance and crews forced to turn away work, industry professionals say.
"There is now an ever increased premium on local crew relationships and good access to infrastructure and studios which need to be planned up to 12 months in advance of production," added Stillking\'s Managing Director Matthew Stillking.
"It\'s a boom time ... likely to last several years as the sector becomes more competitive with a perfect storm of increased consumer viewing demand and more platforms needing content to compete for customers."
\'IT WILL ROCKET\'
Foreign investment in the Czech film industry leapt nearly 1.2 billion crowns to a record 4.8 billion ($210 million) on 1,072 shooting days for 38 foreign series and films in 2018, according to the Czech Film Commission.
Investment is expected to remain at that level or higher this year, though Czech plans to increase cash rebates on offer for film makers from 20 percent now could be a game changer.
"It will rocket once the incentives are raised," Pavlina Zipkova, head of the Czech Film Commission, told Reuters. "The government has not increased it yet but we strongly believe it will happen later this year."
In Hungary, spending on a total of 333 productions last year amounted to 110 billion forints (385 million), with 84 percent of the investment coming from international productions including Hollywood blockbusters "Terminator: Dark Fate" and "Gemini Man."
This was up from 108 billion in 2017, when "Red Sparrow" and "Colette" were made in Hungary but Havas at Hungary\'s Film Fund expects the new EU rules to accelerate the streaming-fueled production boom.
The rise of streaming services has also shifted the types of productions in the region. Hungary attracts more blockbuster films these days while episodic series tend to gravitate towards the Czech Republic, said Tomas Krejci, founder of Milk and Honey Pictures and Prague Studios.
This helped Prague Studio\'s turnover jump more than 50 percent in 2018 - and Krejci predicts demand will remain strong as top notch crews shooting historical shows are more than a third cheaper than in rival countries such as Spain.
"The demand for historical shows is getting stronger," Krejci said whose company has produced "Haunted" for Netflix and Amazon\'s "Patriot" and the second season of "Lore."
"Here it\'s not just the phenomenal historic architecture but also the vast amount of props, costumes and local talent that make it cheaper and easier to make these kinds of shows." ($1 = 22.8160 Czech crowns) ($1 = 285.6800 forints) (Reporting by Michael Kahn; editing by David Clarke)


BERLIN (AP) - Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-left allies are rejecting calls for the expropriation of apartments from corporate property owners in response to rising rents in German cities.
Affordable-housing activists in Berlin launched a grassroots campaign on Saturday to force the city\'s government into taking over nearly 250,000 apartments worth billions. There were protests against increasing rents in other cities.
Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday the chancellor doesn\'t think that is the right solution. He said "the key to affordable living space is not expropriation but having a sufficient number of apartments available."
Andres Nahles, who leads the junior party in Merkel\'s governing coalition, said expropriation is a "false solution."

LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - Airline stocks helped European shares advance on Thursday after European Union leaders gave Britain another six months to leave the bloc, while sterling simply shrugged.
Gains for airlines from easyJet to Lufthansa helped European indexes gain 0.2 percent, with the EU\'s Brexit extension to Oct. 31 clearing some of the uncertainty previously clouding the key summer holiday period.
The summit deal in Brussels, struck in the early hours of Thursday, means that Britain will not crash out of the bloc on Friday without a treaty - though it offers scant clarity on when, how or even if Brexit will happen.
Markets in London and Frankfurt ticked up and Paris outperformed as luxury stocks also gained ground, even with concern over protectionism rumbling and markets digesting central bank warnings over slowing growth.
Futures indicate that Wall Street was set to open higher, a turnaround for global equities after a disappointing day in Asia, where four consecutive days of gains ground to a halt.
The dollar and euro held steady.
Equities and other risky assets have been volatile this year, while bonds have rallied over worries of a slowdown in the United States and other major economies, including the euro zone. Many central banks have taken a dovish stance, pivoting away from moves towards interest rate increases.
The Federal Reserve will likely leave U.S. rates unchanged this year, minutes from its policy meeting last month showed, given risks to the U.S. economy from financial conditions and protectionist trade policies.
The European Central Bank maintained its loose policy stance on Wednesday, highlighting threats to global growth and raising the prospect of more support being pumped into the struggling euro zone economy.
Looming in the background has been concern over a retreat to protectionism, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening new tariffs on EU while the Sino-U.S. trade dispute rumbles on.
The world\'s two biggest economies have largely agreed on a mechanism to police any trade agreement they reach, including establishing new "enforcement offices", U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, with talks due to resume on Thursday.
"We do expect U.S. growth to remain relatively tepid this year compared to what we saw last year, and it will probably lose further momentum as we head towards the end of the year," said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets
MSCI\'s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, hovered around this week\'s six-month highs.
European trading was thin, a trend likely to continue during upcoming disrupted trading weeks in major markets. Easter lies ahead and Japan is due for a 10-day break from late April to mark the ascension of its new emperor.
STERLING STEADY
Major currencies struggled, with the dollar hanging near two-week lows and the euro unmoved.
But most notably sterling was unchanged below $1.31, remaining within the trading range it has held to during the past month or so.
Markets now see less chance Britain will crash out of the EU, so the focus of traders will turn - for the coming months at least - to the underlying state of the British economy, said Thu Lan Nguyen, FX strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
"People have been focused on Brexit ... In the short-term, maybe these investors or traders will look more at the economic fundamentals," she said.
Rising U.S. crude stocks dragged oil lower, though prices found a floor as OPEC-led cuts and plunging Venezuelan output tightened global supplies.
International benchmark Brent futures stood at $71.25 a barrel around midday, down 0.9 percent from their last close.

BUCHAREST, April 6 (Reuters) - Italy may be forced to freeze some of its planned public expenditures this year as the country\'s growth is slower than forecast, European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said on Saturday.
Brussels had predicted in February a meagre 0.2 percent expansion in Italy this year, but Dombrovskis said that growth could turn out to be "even slower" as global and domestic factors had dampened the outlook.
A possible downward revision would further widen the gap with growth estimates made by Italy\'s eurosceptic government, which based its free-spending 2019 budget on the assumption of a 1 percent expansion.
The European Commission will publish its new economic forecasts on May 7.
"There are concerns as the economy has slowed down," Dombrovskis told a news conference in Bucharest. "We need to see what implications it has for the budget."
Speaking the day after a meeting with Italian Finance Minister Giovanni Tria on the budget, Dombrovskis said in these circumstances Italy would probably be required to freeze 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) of spending this year in order to respect EU fiscal rules.
Rome had agreed with Brussels that those 2 billion euros would be spent only if economic conditions did not deteriorate. Now this safeguard clause "should normally be activated," said Dombrovskis, who is the commissioner in charge of the euro.
The clause was negotiated to make sure Rome remained broadly compliant with EU rules that require countries with large public debts to gradually reduce them. Italy\'s debt stands above 130 percent of output, the second highest ratio in the EU after Greece, which went through three bailouts in recent years.
Dombrovskis added that Tria had assured him Italy would respect EU fiscal rules in its budgetary plans for the coming years that will be submitted to Brussels at the end of April.
Earlier this week the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, a club of mostly rich nations, forecast a 0.2 percent output fall in Italy in 2019.

HOUSTON, April 9 (Reuters) - U.S. crude cargoes bound for Europe dropped to the lowest in more than a year in March and will remain low with the narrow spread between U.S. crude and Brent limiting demand, according to trade sources and data from Refinitiv Eikon.
Tankers carrying about 265,000 barrels per day (bpd) of U.S. crude are scheduled to arrive in Rotterdam, Fawley, Trieste and other European ports this month, following a record 718,500 bpd that arrived in March, Eikon data showed.
U.S. crude\'s discount to Brent narrowed to $6.61 on Tuesday. It had tightened to as little as minus $6.49 a barrel last month, the narrowest since mid-August, hampering European demand for U.S. crude exports. The spread had come in from minus $10.27 in February.
U.S. crude will flow to European countries at lower levels until the spread widens again, U.S. trade sources said.
"The Brent-WTI arb will definitely impact U.S. barrels going to Europe," one broker said.
A chemical spill that shut parts of the waterway that connects Houston to the Gulf of Mexico last month also impacted U.S. oil exports, traders said.
A March 17 fire at Mitsui & Co\'s Intercontinental Terminals Co petrochemical facility in Deer Park, Texas, led to a release of fuels and chemicals into the Houston Ship Channel. The U.S. Coast Guard shut the channel for three days and reopened it with restrictions that have not been fully lifted. (Reporting by Collin Eaton in Houston Editing by Susan Thomas)


Gerard Pique is delighted to see ex-Manchester United team-mate Ole Gunnar Solskjaer flourishing at Old Trafford \xe2\x80\x93 but the Barcelona defender is determined to kill off his former club\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League dreams on Wednesday.
Widely considered to be one of the greatest defenders in the world, the 31-year-old made his first steps in the professional game in the north west over a period that he remains eternally grateful for.
Pique joined from Barca aged 17 and went from a boy to a man at United, learning a lot on the field and off it before returning to the LaLiga giants in 2008.

Solskjaer was one of the senior pros as the centre-back came through the ranks and the Barca defender has been impressed by the work being done by someone he looked up to.
\xe2\x80\x9cI remember him as a great team-mate when I arrived here,\xe2\x80\x9d Pique said.
\xe2\x80\x9cI was 17, very young and he was one of the veterans and, for sure, he helped me a lot to adapt to the club, to the country, to the city.
\xe2\x80\x9cHe was at the end of his career and he had some problems with his injuries, but when you were training with him you could see he had that quality to score goals.
\xf0\x9f\x94\x8a @3gerardpique : "This is a very special match for me. I learned a lot in Manchester." #MUFCBar\xc3\xa7a pic.twitter.com/v18rpxf7sq \xe2\x80\x94 FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) April 9, 2019
\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a great experience playing alongside him. He helped me a lot and I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy to see him in now charge of the club, of Manchester United.
\xe2\x80\x9cHe is doing a great job since he took charge of the team.
\xe2\x80\x9cThey have won a lot of games, they are playing much better and tomorrow is going to be a tough game and I hope we can win.\xe2\x80\x9d
Solskjaer recalled playing with Pique in the Premier Reserve League play-off final in 2006, when they scored a goal apiece as they beat Tottenham 2-0.
The United boss called the defender a \xe2\x80\x9cfantastic boy\xe2\x80\x9d and has enjoyed watching his progress over the years, joking that one of his only issues was a fear of needles.
Pique has been impressed by Solskjaer\xc2\xb4s start as manager (Ian Hodgson/PA)
\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s true!\xe2\x80\x9d Pique said with a laugh.
\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, I hate that. \xe2\x80\x9cSince I was young, I really hated needles and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he remembered about it.\xe2\x80\x9d
Pique clearly made a lasting impression Solskjaer, just as United have on him.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something lovely because the fans are fantastic,\xe2\x80\x9d the defender said ahead of stepping out at Old Trafford for the first time since leaving in 2008.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the same if it\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League or a league game or playing against a fourth division side \xe2\x80\x93 the fans are always cheering if you lose or you win.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a different culture. You can see that both on and off the pitch. The fans are into their team.
\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always said that the English culture, I think we could learn a lot from them and one of the things would be this instance.\xe2\x80\x9d
But Pique\xe2\x80\x99s appreciation for United will be replaced by a steely resolve to hurt them on Wednesday.
The 31-year-old has been impressed by the never-say-die attitude brought back by Solskjaer, pointing to the way they made Champions League history by overcoming a 2-0 home loss to beat Paris St Germain 3-1 in the round of 16.
\xe2\x80\x9cI think the PSG tie is a great example,\xe2\x80\x9d Pique said. \xe2\x80\x9cI watched both games and here I think PSG first half was better, second half they scored and they could have scored some more goals.
\xe2\x80\x9cBut you cannot leave Manchester United alive.
\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can beat them scoring a lot of goals, you have to do it because they have great team, great history and they have shown in the second leg in Paris, even though they played with a lot of young lads from the academy, they won, they qualified in the last minute.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great example for us, we have to be very concentrated from the first minute to last minute of the tie.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe know that Manchester United are very dangerous and that we have to play our best game to qualify.\xe2\x80\x9d


Former Swansea boss and ex-Porto defender Carlos Carvalhal delivers his insight on how the Portuguese champions will shape up against Liverpool at Anfield...
\xc2\xa0
STYLE
Porto\'s usual formation domestically this season has been 4-4-2, as Liverpool\'s scouts would have seen in Friday\'s 2-0 win over Boavista, but in Europe they\'ve set up in a 4-3-3, which is how they are likely to line up on Tuesday.
The front three will probably be Jesus Corona and Yacine Brahimi flanking the pace and strength of Moussa Marega down the middle.
Yacine Brahimi (centre) and Moussa Marega (right) will look to cause Liverpool problems
\xc2\xa0
ATTACKING SET-UP\xc2\xa0
Porto will try to get joy out wide, so it\'s vital left back Alex Telles recovers from his hip injury, because when Brahimi moves inside Telles is very good at attacking down his flank.
Porto look to pick out Brahimi between the lines when he drops inside to help organise the build-up play. Marega is a real threat, who excels in the channel between left back and left centre-back.
Andy Robertson\'s absence, however, could see manager Sergio Conceicao go for a bolder option on the counter with Francisco Soares up top and Marega out on the right.
It is vital for Porto that left back Alex Telles recovers from his hip injury and can play
\xc2\xa0
DEFENSIVE SET-UP
I imagine Porto, given Pepe\'s suspension, will line up with the excellent Eder Militao and Felipe at the heart of the defence, with experienced Uruguayan Maxi Pereira stepping in at right back.
There\'s a question mark over the left back role if Telles fails to recover, so young centre backs Diogo Leite and Diogo Queiros have been drafted into the squad.\xc2\xa0
Pepe is suspended for Tuesday\'s match but he has traveled to Anfield to give his support
\xc2\xa0
THE KEY BATTLES\xc2\xa0
Van Dijk v Marega
Marega has great power, while Van Dijk is also really strong. This will be a fascinating battle, especially if Marega can get in behind Milner.
Alexander-Arnold v Brahimi
Brahimi is a creative play-maker who will occupy the young right back\'s area. He\'s very dangerous around the box and possesses excellent dribbling skills so could test Alexander-Arnold defensively.
Salah v Telles
Salah is a great creative talent but could be forced to help out defensively against Telles, who is a very offensive-minded player and is influential to Porto\'s team play.
Mane v Maxi Pereira
Mane\'s pace and goal scoring instincts will test Pereira, who will need to use all his experience to stop Mane cutting inside dangerously.\xc2\xa0

April 10 (Reuters) - European shares edged higher on Wednesday ahead of a Brexit summit and a policy meeting of the European Central Bank, with Spanish shares rising for the first time in three days.
The regional STOXX 600 index was up 0.2 percent at 0929 GMT after flitting between slight gains and losses, led by advances in Madrid and Frankfurt.
The ECB is widely expected to keep borrowing costs on hold, but investors will be keen to see if the region\'s central bank provides more details on its plans to issue a new round of cheap multi-year loans to banks to support economic growth.
The rate decision is due out at 1145 GMT.
"The economic data out of the Eurozone shows that the growth has become feeble and there is a strong need for more support from the ECB," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at TF Global Markets (UK) Ltd in London.
Investors are also waiting for U.S. inflation data and minutes of the Federal Reserve\'s March policy meeting due later in the day.
Buoying sentiment was the latest data showing Britain\'s economy unexpectedly grew in February, which follows the International Monetary Fund cutting its 2019 global economic growth forecasts for third time in seven months on Tuesday.
European basic resources stocks led gains on STOXX 600 while retail sector was another notable gainer, rising after four sessions of losses.
Tesco boosted the pan-region index after the company posted a better-than-expected full-year operating profit, cementing the recovery of Britain\'s biggest supermarket.
Dunelm Group Plc rose more than 2 percent as the homeware retailer said it expected to top analysts\' forecasts for full-year profit, as surging online demand helped it ride out a tough British retail environment.
Shares of ASOS surged 14 percent after the British online fashion retailer stuck to its full-year guidance for sales, profit margins and capital expenditure despite a plunge in first-half pretax profit.
At the other end of the index, British engine maker Rolls-Royce dipped after agreeing to inspections on some Trent 1000 TEN engines earlier than previously planned, after the re-emergence of issues related to blade deterioration.
Shares in Indivior Plc plunged by about 75 percent after the U.S. Justice Department announced the indictment of the British drugmaker and a subsidiary on charges that they engaged in an illegal scheme to boost prescriptions of the film version of its opioid addiction treatment Suboxone.
Some ex-dividend stocks, including Swedish Match, Sampo, Nokian Tyres, were among the biggest weights on the index.
Britain\'s FTSE was little changed ahead of a summit between British Prime Minister Theresa and the European Union where a Brexit extension until the end of the year or until March 2020 was looking like the most likely outcome, EU diplomats said.
Reckitt Benckiser slid more than 6 percent as the U.S. Department of Justice alleged that the illegal marketing scheme began before Indivior was spun out of the consumer goods group. (Reporting by Medha Singh and Susan Mathew in Bengaluru; Editing by Angus MacSwan and Hugh Lawson)


Democratic 2020 hopeful Beto O\'Rourke launched a stinging attack on Donald Trump yesterday in which he compared the President\'s administration to Nazi Germany.
In an explosive intervention, the former congressman accused the White House\'s immigration rhetoric of being strikingly similar to the language used during Hitler\'s Third Reich.\xc2\xa0
The Texan, who narrowly lost the state\'s tight Senate race, hit out at the President\'s labeling of migrants as \'animals and an infestation\'.
Democratic 2020 hopeful Beto O\'Rourke launched a stinging attack on Donald Trump yesterday in Iowa where he compared the President\'s administration to Nazi Germany
Speaking in Iowa, where he will fight his first caucus in February next year, Mr O\'Rourke said: \'Putting kids in cages, saying that Neonazis and Klansmen and white supremacists are "very fine people"?\'
\'Now, I might expect someone to describe another human being as an infestation in the Third Reich.
\'I would not expect that in the United States of America.\'\xc2\xa0
He added: \'Seeking to ban all Muslims, all people of one religion, what other country on the face of the planet does that kind of thing?\xc2\xa0
\'Or in our human history? Or in the history of the western world?\xc2\xa0Because they are somehow deficient or violent or a threat to us?\'
President Donald Trump came under fire for his language on immigration which Mr O\'Rourke claimed likened migrants to \'animals and an infestation\'
Mr O\'Rourke said: \' I might expect someone to describe another human being as an infestation in the Third Reich\' (Hitler pictured at the regime\'s 10th anniversary)\xc2\xa0
Mr O\'Rourke moved to increase the war of words against the President ahead of next year\'s General Election which Mr Trump has declared he will stand in once again.
And the man vying to be the Democrats\' candidate, whose campaign recently declared to have already raised $9.4million, hit out at the language coming out of the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0
Mr O\'Rourke said that Democrats need to call out \'the rhetoric of a president who not only describes immigrants as rapists and criminals but as animals and an infestation.\'\xc2\xa0
The 46-year-old announced his Presidential bid on March 14 following widespread speculation of his candidacy after an energetic but unsuccessful Senate race.\xc2\xa0

DUBLIN, April 3 (Reuters) - Ireland will defer a revaluation of its national property tax by a year and extend controls on residential rents in areas where they are growing rapidly until 2021 in a bid to keep a lid on rising housing costs.
Irish house prices have almost doubled since the government introduced a tax based on the market value of residential properties in 2013, and it postponed an initial revaluation by three years in 2016 to ensure bills remained frozen.
By opting to move that date out further to November 2020, the government likely pushed it beyond the next parliamentary election, with an agreement keeping the minority administration in power due to expire early next year.
But Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said he was determined to retain and reform the tax, and that following consultation with parliament hoped the changes in its application would result in manageable increases, for a minority of taxpayers.
"It\'s here, it\'s here to stay, but moments of change like this have been difficult elsewhere and I want to be sure we get this change right," Donohoe told reporters on Wednesday, referencing a property tax in the United Kingdom which is still based on values in 1990s.
While house prices are 18 percent below the peak hit at the height of a property bubble just over a decade ago, rents have long surpassed their previous high and in Dublin are 25 percent up on levels seen in the Celtic Tiger boom years of the 2000s.
Ireland imposed temporary controls in 2016 to limit annual rent increases to 4 percent, initially in the two largest cities of Dublin and Cork before other major cities. Areas surrounding the capital later qualified.
Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said on Tuesday that the government had decided to extend the so-called rent pressure zones until 2021 and would outline changes to the qualification criteria outside Dublin in coming days.
Average rents still rose by 6.9 percent year-on-year in the final three months of 2018, a similar rate to when the controls were introduced three years earlier. (Reporting by Padraic Halpin Editing by David Holmes)


BERLIN (AP) - Police in northern Germany say they have detained a 17-year-old boy with several knives after being tipped off to an online chat in which someone threatened to kill several people at a school.
Officers checked students entering the school in Flensburg, just south of the Danish border, on Wednesday morning and detained the German teenager. Police said initial investigations firmed up suspicions against him, without elaborating. The chat surfaced on Tuesday evening and the threat applied to Wednesday.
Lessons were held as normal after boy was detained.


April 10(Reuters) - Recruitment firm PageGroup Plc on Wednesday posted higher first-quarter gross profit, as robust business in Britain and Germany offset slowness in Greater China and France.
Gross profit for the quarter grew 11.7 percent to 208.8 million pounds ($272.82 million).
Britain recorded its third straight quarter of growth as profit grew 1.7 percent, allaying Brexit-related nervousness in the jobs market. Profit from Germany expanded 23 percent.
PageGroup, which was set up above a launderette in London in 1976 and helps hire executives, professionals and clerical staff said trade tariff uncertainty in Greater China and \'gilets jaunes\' protests in France impacted candidate confidence. The "yellow vests" protests, named after the bright jackets that French drivers have to keep in their cars and which have been worn by demonstrators, began in November after public anger against fuel tax rises. PageGroup said it expects full-year 2019 operating profit to be in line with its compiled consensus of 160.4 million pounds. ($1 = 0.7653 pounds)

The leader of Sinn Fein has apologised for marching behind an \xe2\x80\x9cEngland Get Out of Ireland\xe2\x80\x9d banner on St Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Day.
Mary Lou McDonald moved to reassure the public that its message was not directed at English people.
\xe2\x80\x9cFor anybody who felt that it was directed at English people, I just want to reassure them that that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.
The Dublin Central TD was condemned for helping carry the sign last month in New York City\xe2\x80\x99s annual parade to mark the Irish national holiday.
Her actions were described as offensive and divisive by Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney.
@MaryLouMcDonald this is NOT leadership - it\xe2\x80\x99s offensive, divisive and an embarrassment - grow up, this is NOT #ireland in 2019! we are better than this! \xf0\x9f\x87\xae\xf0\x9f\x87\xaa https://t.co/LUbfbvOe6l \xe2\x80\x94 Simon Coveney (@simoncoveney) March 17, 2019
An opinion poll published by the Sunday Business Post over the weekend showed support for Sinn Fein had dropped by five points to 13%. The figure was 18% in February.

On Monday Ms McDonald said: \xe2\x80\x9cIn respect of St Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Day, I think it starts certainly a conversation around that banner which has been up and down Fifth Avenue for a generation.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very direct political statement, it\xe2\x80\x99s an anti-partition statement.
\xe2\x80\x9cI know it was taken by some to be directed at English people. It certainly was not and is not.\xe2\x80\x9d
She described the slogan as a \xe2\x80\x9cfairly blunt statement at any time\xe2\x80\x9d.
Speaking on RTE Radio 1 she said: \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose all of us have to be conscious of not just what we say and what is meant, but also what is heard and what is understood.\xe2\x80\x9d
Asked whether she was inching towards an apology, she replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have to inch towards anything\xe2\x80\xa6 for anybody who felt that it was directed at English people I just want to reassure them that that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case.
\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I have blood relatives myself who are English \xe2\x80\xa6 and English people are very welcome in Ireland.
\xe2\x80\x9cMany of them live amongst us, they are our neighbours and our friends, so certainly I apologise to anybody who felt that the banner was intended in that way, and I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to clarify that it\xe2\x80\x99s not. It certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that.\xe2\x80\x9d
On the political sentiment behind the banner, Ms McDonald said she would not apologise for being \xe2\x80\x9ca united Irelander\xe2\x80\x9d and for wanting unity and democracy across Ireland.
\xe2\x80\x9cFar from apologising for it, I wear that political position as a badge of honour,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.
The Democratic Unionist Party said Ms McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s apology was motivated by poll ratings rather than remorse.
East Antrim MLA Gordon Lyons said: \xe2\x80\x9cMary Lou McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s apology is a cynical response to falling poll ratings rather than any acknowledgement of remorse.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt is testament to Sinn Fein\xe2\x80\x99s place on the sidelines of politics that gaffes by their new president have been their most significant contribution to politics in recent months.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt is clear however that a drop in support has pressed those who take the decisions within Sinn Fein to stop defending the banner and belatedly send Mary Lou McDonald out to issue this supposed apology.\xe2\x80\x9d
Mr Lyons said if the party\xe2\x80\x99s leadership was truly focused on repairing the damage it would commit to working with all other parties to restore the Stormont Assembly.


A 39ft-long Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton which weighs the same as four Mini Cooper cars has arrived in Glasgow on the latest stop of its European tour.
Trix the T-rex will be housed in a bespoke, climate-controlled 600 square metre pavilion at the city\xe2\x80\x99s Kelvin Hall.
It will be on display to the public from April 18 until July 31 in an interactive exhibition which also includes a painted reconstruction of the 5,000kg dinosaur.
The T.rex in Town tour started in September 2016 and has visited Salzburg, Barcelona, Paris and Lisbon while waiting for a new home to be completed at the Naturalis Biodiversity Centre in Leiden, Holland.
It is said to be unlikely that the T-rex will go on such a tour again.

Steph Scholten, director of The Hunterian which organised the exhibition, said he is \xe2\x80\x9cdelighted\xe2\x80\x9d to welcome the fossil to Scotland.
He said: \xe2\x80\x9cBringing this major touring exhibition to the city will allow thousands of Scots, and visitors to Scotland, to see one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most iconic dinosaur species.
\xe2\x80\x9cTyrannosaurus rex skeletons are very rare finds and Trix is the only real touring T-rex fossil in the world. This is a major coup for Glasgow, which is the only UK stop on her European tour.
\xe2\x80\x9cT-rex in Town offers a once in a lifetime experience for visitors to come face to face with a real T-rex and learn about her life through this superb interactive exhibition.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe hope everyone who comes to see this incredible dinosaur specimen will be as excited to see her as we are.\xe2\x80\x9d
Trix is one of only three T-rex skeletons in the world and it was discovered in Montana in the United States.
Dinosaur fans have also delighted in having the famous Diplodocus sculpture Dippy at Glasgow\xe2\x80\x99s Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum \xe2\x80\x93 across the road from Kelvin Hall where Trix is being exhibited.

Glasgow councillor David McDonald said: \xe2\x80\x9cLike thousands of other visitors, I am really excited to see this impressive, if slightly scary, creature take shape before my eyes.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s incredible to watch the skilled team from Naturalis in the Netherlands bring this extremely rare real dinosaur skeleton to life in Glasgow.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe look forward to welcoming many dinosaur fans to Kelvin Hall over the coming months, where Glaswegians and visitors to the city can enjoy this unique opportunity to stare into the eyes of one of the most terrifying predators ever to have stalked the earth.
\xe2\x80\x9cUntil May 6 visitors can also marvel at Dippy, the Natural History Museum\xe2\x80\x99s famous Diplodocus, at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe trust these spectacular exhibitions will inspire curiosity about the natural world around us.\xe2\x80\x9d
Tickets for the Kelvin Hall exhibition are available now priced \xc2\xa314 for adults and \xc2\xa38 for children, with family tickets at \xc2\xa339.50.


FRANKFURT, April 2 (Reuters) - Germany\'s greenhouse gas emissions fell 4.2 percent in 2018, as high coal prices discouraged burning of the fuel at power stations and unusually hot weather curbed heating demand, official figures showed on Tuesday.
However, the federal environment agency, UBA (Umweltbundesamt), said more needed to be done to achieve climate targets up to 2030, especially in transport, heating and agriculture.
Climate-harming emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2 percent last year to 869 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents, according to preliminary UBA data.
"After four years of stagnation, there was a sizeable year-on-year reduction," the state body said. "But we need more of this."
Compared to 1990, the Kyoto accord base year, German emissions have fallen by 30.6 percent, but the 2030 target, set by the 2016 Paris climate accord, is for cuts of at least 55 percent.
Germany abandoned a self-imposed target of cutting emissions by 40 percent by 2020 as it cannot rein in coal power generation and automotive pollution fast enough.
Environment minister Svenja Schulze, to whom the UBA reports, said she will push for a climate law to be decided this year to set Germany on a course toward the 2030 climate targets.
This would require more effort from lagging sectors and support drives towards e-mobility and green gas technologies.
Last year, the energy and household sectors curbed pollution as more renewable power came on line, home heating use fell and heating oil purchases were postponed into 2019 because hot weather dried up rivers so that oil barges could not sail, UBA noted.
Motorists used less gasoline and diesel because of high prices linked to the price of crude oil.
The energy industry, which is undergoing a staged transition to renewable technologies, saw its emissions fall by 4.5 percent to just under 300 million tonnes, UBA said.
Transport sector emissions fell by 2.9 percent, those by industrial processes -- especially form steelmaking, chemicals and cars -- by 2.8 percent and those of households by 10.9 percent.
Agricultural emissions increased by 0.7 percent as livestock numbers increased, while waste industries cut emissions by 5.3 percent as improving recycling conditions mean biological waste can no longer be buried.
The bulk of Germany\'s total emissions in 2018 consisted of CO2, accounting for 760 million tonnes, a 4.8 percent fall from a year earlier. The rest was made up of other noxious gases also monitored by the UBA. (Reporting by Vera Eckert and Markus Wacket, editing by Kirsten Donovan)


ROME, April 3 (Reuters) - Italy\'s services sector expanded in March at its fastest rate since last September, with new orders growth at its highest level for six months, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The data, which was well above market expectations, provides some hope that the euro zone\'s third-largest economy could soon exit the shallow recession it fell into at the end of last year.
The IHS Markit Business Activity Index for services rose to 53.1 in March from 50.4 in February, moving further above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
A Reuters survey of 11 analysts had forecast a reading of 50.8.
The sub-index for new business in the service sector rebounded to 53.0 from 49.8 in February, when it dipped below 50 for the first time in four years.
IHS Markit\'s sister survey for the smaller manufacturing sector, published on Monday, showed activity contracting for a sixth straight month and at its fastest rate for almost six years.
The composite Purchasing Managers\' Index (PMI) for services and manufacturing rose to 51.5 in March compared to 49.6 in February -- its strongest reading in six months, IHS Markit said.
The OECD forecast on Monday that Italy\'s economy would contract by 0.2 percent this year, but the government has said it will adopt a stimulus package to ensure growth remains above zero.

April 9 (Reuters) - Bank stocks helped European shares shrug off early weakness on Tuesday, but gains were kept in check by a drop in shares of Airbus and its suppliers after the United States ratcheted up a trade dispute with the European Union over aircraft subsidies.
A rise in bank shares following two days of losses helped the pan-region STOXX 600 index up 0.4 percent in thin trade. Most European bourses posted small gains.
Investors are keeping a close eye on a trade summit between the European Union and China on Tuesday in which the bloc will try to coax Beijing to open up its markets.
"One thing that China has taken away from this trade war with the U.S. is that it can\'t be so trade reliant on the U.S., it needs to form closer ties with Europe, and I think that\'s the message that is really going to come out of this," said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA in London.
Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is expected to hold borrowing costs when its policymakers meet on Wednesday, the same day British Prime Minister Theresa May\'s request to delay Brexit until June 30 will be formally discussed by EU leaders at a special summit.
Apple supplier AMS jumped more than 4 percent after Liberum raised its rating on the company and forecast an improvement in its sales and gross margins this year. Other chip stocks - STMicroelectronics and Infineon Technologies - followed with gains of more than 1 percent.
Total SA was among the biggest boosts to the STOXX 600 after the French oil and gas major and its partners signed a long-awaited deal with Papua New Guinea that will allow work to start on a $13 billion plan to double the country\'s liquefied natural gas exports.
Airbus dropped more than 1 percent after the U.S. Trade Representative proposed tariffs on a list of EU products including large commercial aircraft and parts. The European planemaker said it saw no legal basis for the move.
Washington is responding to more than $11 billion of EU subsidies to Airbus that the World Trade Organization has found cause "adverse effects" to the United States.
Airbus suppliers such as Safran, Leonardo and Rolls-Royce lost between 0.6 and 0.9 percent.
Two rating downgrades in tech stocks pulled the sector down the most. SAP SE fell for the fourth day in a row as UBS cut the stock to "neutral" from "buy", while Bechtle AG dropped after Berenberg did the same.
Swiss drugmaker Novartis slipped more than 1 percent, among the biggest drags on STOXX 600, after completing the spin off of its eyecare unit Alcon.
Alcon shares surged about 40 percent on their debut.
Merck KGaA dipped after winning the backing of Versum\'s board for a sweetened $6.5 billion takeover bid, overturning Versum\'s agreed merger with Entegris.

BRUSSELS/PARIS/WASHINGTON, April 9 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States would impose tariffs on $11 billion worth of European Union products, heightening tensions over a long-running transatlantic aircraft subsidy dispute that threatens to become a broader trade battle.
The two sides have been locked in a years-long spat over mutual claims of illegal aid to plane giants, Netherlands-based Airbus and U.S.-based Boeing Co, to help them gain advantage in the world jet business.
The case has been grinding its way through the World Trade Organization for almost 15 years and is reaching a climax as both sides approach the final stages of arbitration.
"The World Trade Organization finds that the European Union subsidies to Airbus has adversely impacted the United States, which will now put Tariffs on $11 Billion of EU products!" Trump said on Twitter. "The EU has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade for many years. It will soon stop!"
His comments came a day after the U.S. Trade Representative proposed a list of EU products targeted for tariffs, ranging from large commercial aircraft to dairy products and wine, as retaliation for European aircraft subsidies. The final list is expected this summer.
In response, the European Commission said earlier Tuesday it had started to draw up plans to retaliate over Boeing subsidies.
"The Commission is starting preparations so that the EU can promptly take action based on the arbitrator\'s decision on retaliation rights in this case," a Commission spokesman said. "The European Union remains open for discussions with the United States, provided these are without preconditions and aim at a fair outcome."
Both sides have won partial victories in claiming Airbus and Boeing received unlawful subsidies but disagree on the amount involved and whether each has complied with earlier WTO rulings.
Airbus said it saw no legal basis for the U.S. move and warned of deepening transatlantic trade tensions.
The EU is already facing U.S. tariffs on its steel and aluminium exports and Trump has repeatedly threatened to hit EU cars with punitive duties.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told a conference in Paris that the two sides needed to reach a friendly agreement.
"When I see the situation global growth is in, I don\'t think we can afford to have a trade conflict, even if only on the specific issues of the aircraft industry in the United States and Europe," he said.
\'MORE TIT-FOR-TAT\'
The U.S. tariffs proposal put pressure on shares in European makers of aircraft and aerospace suppliers, wine, cheese and luxury goods.
Airbus fell nearly 2 percent, while Boeing dropped 1.5 percent. Airbus suppliers such as Safran and Leonardo also were down.
Analysts were divided over whether the ramped-up dispute would lead to greater global trade issues.
"Get ready for more tit-for-tat scrapping to follow," said John Woolfitt of London brokerage Atlantic Markets.
Germany is particularly apprehensive of possible U.S. tariffs on car imports. The United States is a major market for Volkswagen, Mercedes maker Daimler and BMW.
Moody\'s said on Tuesday that potential U.S. tariffs on imported autos and parts represented a significant risk to global growth and would hinder economic momentum in Germany, Japan and Korea.
" ... The U.S. wants to pressure the EU to engage in meaningful trade talks, but without having to apply the more painful measure of automotive tariffs," said Cailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit.
Fabiana Fedeli at Robeco sees the latest moves as tactical.
"The new tariffs ... are a drop in the ocean as a percentage of the overall trade between the U.S. and Europe and we view them as a negotiating tool to set the tone for what the really important negotiations are, namely autos," she said.

BERLIN (AP) - German authorities have carried out raids on groups suspected of helping the militant Palestinian group Hamas under the guise of providing humanitarian aid.
The interior ministry said some 90 properties across Germany associated with an "Islamist network" were searched on Wednesday. It said the network was headed by two groups based in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, WWR Help and Ansaar International.
The ministry said there are indications that the network provided financial and propaganda support to Hamas, a longtime enemy of Israel that runs the Gaza Strip and was listed as a terror group by the European Union in 2001.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that "anyone who supports Hamas under the cover of humanitarian aid flouts fundamental value judgments of our constitution."


DUBLIN, April 8 (Reuters) - Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar spoke to Britain\'s Theresa May on Monday about her plan to seek a further extension to the Article 50 Brexit negotiating period, the Irish government said in a statement.
EU leaders will meet on Wednesday to discuss Britain\'s request.
The Irish government said that in the call with May, Varadkar had "repeated his openness to an extension of the deadline." (Reporting by Padraic Halpin, Writing by Kylie MacLellan in London; editing by William James)

LONDON, April 10 (Reuters) - Shares of European chipmakers fell sharply on Wednesday after German silicon wafer maker Siltronic warned of a "significantly" weaker second quarter in the latest setback for a sector reeling from slowing smartphone demand.
Pointing to economic slowdown, geopolitical uncertainties and continuing inventory corrections, Siltronic said the timing of a market rebound is "not visible".
Siltronic shares fell as much as 9 percent on the STOXX 600 , giving up most of their gains from a recent rally on optimism over a potential U.S.-China trade deal.
By 1449 GMT the shares were down 5.3 percent, set for their worst day since Feb. 21.
That cast a shadow over other European semiconductor companies, with AMS registering a 6.2 percent retreat and Dialog Semiconductor dipping by 0.3 percent.
Siltronic said it expects 2019 earnings per share to be "significantly" below 2018, a marked change in language from previous guidance of "slightly" lower.
"Taken in isolation, this Siltronic warning really shouldn\xc2\xb4t be a surprise, should it?," said Mirabaud Securities analyst Neil Campling, pointing to recent warnings from Siltronic customers Samsung Electronics, TSMC and Infineon.
"A good dose of reality check is needed for the sector."

LONDON (AP) - The Latest on Brexit (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
\xc2\xa0European Council President Donald Tusk has urged European Union member states to offer the U.K. a flexible extension of up to a year to make sure the nation doesn\'t crash out of the bloc in a chaotic and costly way.\xc2\xa0
Two EU officials, who requested anonymity because they weren\'t authorized to disclose information before it was made public, said that Tusk wants a one-year "Flextention" and get it approved at next Wednesday\'s EU summit.\xc2\xa0
Such a move would mean that the U.K. needs to take part in the May 23-26 European elections, something which British Prime Minister Theresa May has long argued against.\xc2\xa0
May asked Tusk for a short extension until June 30 earlier Friday. Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU on April 12.

9:25 a.m.
Prime Minister Theresa May says Britain will make contingency plans to take part in European Parliament elections in May if no Brexit deal is reached in the interim.
She said in her letter Friday to the EU that she is making these preparations even though she believes it\'s not in Britain\'s interest or the European Union\'s interest for Britain to take part in the elections because it is a departing member state.
May says she "accepts" the EU position that if Britain hasn\'t left the 28-nation bloc by May 23, it will have a legal obligation to take part in the elections.
The prime minister says she is still hopeful of reaching a compromise agreement that could take Britain out of the EU before that time.
___
9:20 a.m.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is requesting that the deadline for her country to leave the European Union be extended until June 30.
In a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk Friday, May said that "the United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June, 2019."
EU leaders agreed late last month to prolong the Brexit date from March 29 until April 12, unless May could push their mutually agreed divorce deal through Parliament.
The Europeans would prefer that Britain don\'t take part in the May 23-26 EU elections if it is going to leave. April 12 is the last day for Britain to signal whether it will field candidates.

April 4 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were little changed on Thursday following a recent run of gains, as lack of fresh developments on trade talks with China and worries about global economic growth kept risk appetite in check.
Negotiations continued in Washington on Wednesday after meetings last week in Beijing, as the two sides worked toward resolving their long-standing trade dispute which has cast a shadow over global economic growth.
President Donald Trump is set to meet Vice Premier Liu He, who is leading the Chinese side in the talks later in the day.
Hopes that the two countries will strike a deal have driven the S&P 500 to a strong first-quarter performance and it has closed higher all of this week. The index is near its highest level since Oct. 10 and is less than 2% away from hitting an all-time high.
Countering the optimism has been a set of lackluster data. Germany\'s industrial orders in February fell at their sharpest rate in more than two years and 2019 growth forecasts were slashed by more than half by leading economic institutes in Europe\'s biggest economy.
U.S. data on Wednesday showed services sector activity hit a more than 19-month low in March and private payrolls grew less than expected. Investors will get a clearer picture when the Labor Department releases the non-farm payrolls report on Friday.
A separate report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, is likely to show that initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 5,000 to 216,000 applications for the week ended March 30.
At 7:02 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 6 points, or 0.02%. S&P 500 e-minis were down 0.25 points, or 0.01% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 4.25 points, or 0.06%.
Stocks closed higher on Wednesday as chipmakers rallied on trade hopes and bullish reports on revival of chip demand, taking the Philadelphia Semiconductor index to a record high.
Micron Technology Inc, after closing up more than 3% on Wednesday, fell 3.3% in premarket trading after Morgan Stanley downgraded the chipmaker\'s stock to "underweight" from "equal-weight".
Tesla Inc dropped 8% after the electric carmaker\'s deliveries fell 31% in the first quarter on challenges in shipping to Europe and China. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar and Shreyashi Sanyal in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)


Nigel Farage has announced that he will stand in the European Parliament elections next month for his new Brexit Party.
The former Ukip leader said he would not, after 25 years of \xe2\x80\x9cendeavour\xe2\x80\x9d, watch British politicians \xe2\x80\x9croll us over\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 as he warned of a \xe2\x80\x9cfightback\xe2\x80\x9d.
Mr Farage\xe2\x80\x99s comments came after Theresa May said the Government would begin \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible preparations\xe2\x80\x9d for the UK to take part in the European Parliament elections on May 23 if her Withdrawal Agreement has not been ratified by then.
He told Sky News: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be leading the Brexit Party into those European elections as it now looks certain they will happen.

\xe2\x80\x9cAm I happy about it? No I\xe2\x80\x99m not \xe2\x80\x93 actually I\xe2\x80\x99ve got many other things in my life I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do, I thought we\xe2\x80\x99d won the Brexit battle but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to after 25 years of endeavour watch British politicians roll us over.
\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the fightback and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be very surprised by what they get.\xe2\x80\x9d
Nigel Farage said he would not watch British politicians `roll us over\xc2\xb4 (Steve Parsons/PA)
Mr Farage also accused the Prime Minister and parliamentarians of trying to \xe2\x80\x9ckill Brexit stone dead\xe2\x80\x9d.
\xe2\x80\x9cThey have done it by endlessly kicking the can down the road but what they haven\xe2\x80\x99t noticed is the growing anger in this country\xe2\x80\xa6
\xe2\x80\x9cI think Brexit will happen, I think the genie\xe2\x80\x99s out the bottle, I just fear there are more battles to fight until we get there.\xe2\x80\x9d
The prominent Brexiteer led Ukip to a win in the popular vote at the 2014 European elections \xe2\x80\x93 but has failed to win a Westminster seat in seven attempts.
He quit Ukip in December, saying there is a \xe2\x80\x9chuge space for a Brexit party in British politics, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t be filled by Ukip\xe2\x80\x9d.
The Brexit Party was founded in January by Catherine Blaiklock, reportedly with Mr Farage\xe2\x80\x99s full support.


BERLIN (AP) - German prosecutors say they\'ve charged a 26-year-old former Afghan officer with war crimes for allegedly abusing prisoners and defiling the corpse of a man he boasted he\'d "killed like a donkey."
Ahmad Zaheer D., whose last name wasn\'t given in line with privacy laws, is accused of shaking two prisoners by the hair during an interrogation around late 2013 and punching one, while another soldier hit a third with a hose.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that the suspect brought the corpse of a high-ranking enemy commander into a town in March 2014, telling villagers he\'d killed him and putting a meat hook into the corpse\'s head, then stringing the body up with a rope.
He was arrested Oct. 25 near Munich. It wasn\'t clear when he came to Germany.


A hard border would be \xe2\x80\x9cflabbergasting\xe2\x80\x9d for people in the north west of Ireland, the leader of Donegal Council has said.
Seamus O\xe2\x80\x99Domhnaill made the point not only in terms of the fluid movement of people across the border on a daily basis but also in terms of supporting the two hospitals in Donegal and Londonderry and\xc2\xa0students.
He said Donegal shares a much longer land border with Derry, compared with the \xe2\x80\x9cumbilical cord\xe2\x80\x9d it shares with the rest of the Republic of Ireland.

Mr\xc2\xa0O\xe2\x80\x99Domhnaill was speaking as he led a delegation from both Donegal County and Derry and Strabane District Councils to present to an Irish Government committee.
He told the Joint Committee for the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in Dublin\xc2\xa0that today alone he had already\xc2\xa0crossed the border twice.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a somewhat frustrating time with much fear from the people in that region because consequences of decisions that will be made or won\xe2\x80\x99t be made at Westminster will impact more on the region than any other region in Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.
\xe2\x80\x9cFor instance when I came down here today, I crossed the border at Lifford into Strabane, but equally from Donegal you have to come back out of the north, so you have to cross it twice to come to Dublin which is our capital city.

\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if we look at the demography and geography of Donegal, our largest land border is with the six counties, only 3% of our land border is actually with the Republic of Ireland. We are but tied to the Republic of Ireland by an umbilical cord, and it is important that the border that we have with the six counties is cherished, that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t weakened and that nothing by way of stopping progress or collaboration can be drawn up.
\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter what happens or what deal, no matter how good that deal is, it will not be as good as what is currently in place.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe hear talk of green cards, we hear talk of people being worried about insurance, but if we delve more into it about healthcare, education, about the free movement of people and goods, and tariffs, that\xe2\x80\x99s frightening stuff for us in Donegal and Derry.
A banner reading "Derry voted Remain" hung from the city\xc2\xb4s walls. (Niall Carson/PA)
\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something when you talk about it in a real way and how it will impact on normal day to day lives, it is totally profound and flabbergasting.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt is important that whatever negotiations or talks are had by anyone about Brexit, the real impacts that will affect the people from our region are taken into consideration and that the people who are making those decisions know they are making decisions that are going to change lives for the people from our region.\xe2\x80\x9d
Mr\xc2\xa0O\xe2\x80\x99Domhnaill also urged the committee for support in pressing for the long anticipated upgrade of the A5, pointing out that with no railways, Donegal is almost entirely dependent on roads.
\xe2\x80\x9cIf we look at a map of this island, the only area that is not connected by major motorway or dual carriage is the north west, and this is something we are going to fall further behind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.
\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you look at the impending decisions to be taken in terms of Brexit, it puts us at a serious disadvantage.\xe2\x80\x9d


What happened?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Mount Vesuvius erupted in the year AD 79, burying the cities of Pompeii, Oplontis, and Stabiae under ashes and rock fragments, and the city of Herculaneum under a mudflow.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0
Mount Vesuvius, on the west coast of Italy, is the only active volcano in continental Europe and is thought to be one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Every single resident died instantly when the southern Italian town was hit by a 500\xc2\xb0C pyroclastic hot surge.
Pyroclastic flows are a dense collection of hot gas and volcanic materials that flow down the side of an erupting volcano at high speed.
They are more dangerous than lava because they travel faster, at speeds of around 450mph (700 km/h), and at temperatures of 1,000\xc2\xb0C.
An administrator and poet called Pliny the younger watched the disaster unfold from a distance.\xc2\xa0
Letters describing what he saw were found in the 16th century.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
His writing suggests that the eruption caught the residents of Pompeii unaware.
Mount Vesuvius erupted in the year AD 79, burying the cities of Pompeii, Oplontis, and Stabiae under ashes and rock fragments, and the city of Herculaneum under a mudflow
He said that a column of smoke \'like an umbrella pine\' rose from the volcano and made the towns around it as black as night.
People ran for their lives with torches, screaming and some wept as rain of ash and pumice fell for several hours.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
While the eruption lasted for around 24 hours, the first pyroclastic surges began at midnight, causing the volcano\'s column to collapse.
An avalanche of hot ash, rock and poisonous gas rushed down the side of the volcano at 124mph (199kph), burying victims and remnants of everyday life.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Hundreds of refugees sheltering in the vaulted arcades at the seaside in Herculaneum, clutching their jewellery and money, were killed instantly.
The Orto dei fuggiaschi (The garden of the Fugitives) shows the 13 bodies of victims who were buried by the ashes as they attempted to flee Pompeii during the 79 AD eruption of the Vesuvius volcano
As people fled Pompeii or hid in their homes, their bodies were covered by blankets of the surge.
While Pliny did not estimate how many people died, the event was said to be \'exceptional\' and the number of deaths is thought to exceed 10,000.
What have they found?
This event ended the life of the cities but at the same time preserved them until rediscovery by archaeologists nearly 1700 years later.
The excavation of Pompeii, the industrial hub of the region and Herculaneum, a small beach resort, has given unparalleled insight into Roman life.
Archaeologists are continually uncovering more from the ash-covered city.
In May archaeologists uncovered an alleyway of grand houses, with balconies left mostly intact and still in their original hues.
A plaster cast of a dog, from the House of Orpheus, Pompeii, AD 79.\xc2\xa0Around 30,000 people are believed to have died in the chaos, with bodies still being discovered to this day
Some of the balconies even had amphorae - the conical-shaped terra cotta vases that were used to hold wine and oil in ancient Roman times.
The discovery has been hailed as a \'complete novelty\' - and the Italian Culture Ministry hopes they can be restored and opened to the public.
Upper stores have seldom been found among the ruins of the ancient town, which was destroyed by an eruption of Vesuvius volcano and buried under up to six metres of ash and volcanic rubble.

April 5 (Reuters) - European shares were flat on Friday as investors waited for concrete progress in trade talks between China and the United States ahead of a closely-watched U.S. jobs report.
The pan-region STOXX 600 index was little changed at 0915 GMT, set for its best weekly rise in three weeks.
Bourses in the region were mixed with Britain\'s FTSE 100 edging higher while Germany\'s tariff-sensitive DAX dipped.
German industrial output rose in February, some good news for Europe\'s largest economy while other data showed France\'s trade deficit narrowed in the same period.
All eyes will now be on the U.S. non-farm payrolls report for March due later in the day, which is expected to show a recovery from February\'s 17-month low.
"It is the most important day when we speak of the economic data when investors get to see the health of the U.S. labour market. This particular number has the capacity to set the trading tone for the rest of the month," Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at TF Global Markets in London, wrote in a note.
Earlier in the week upbeat factory data from China and Europe led equities to rally, somewhat mollifying investor concerns over global growth that have dominated world markets since late-last year.
Hopes that the U.S.-China talks would yield a trade truce have been a major driver for European stocks this week with auto stocks leading the rally.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday a deal with China could be announced within four weeks.
"It is becoming increasingly more concrete and clear that both sides want to secure a deal, hence the optimism is advancing that the outcome of a signed trade deal is moving towards a matter of \'when\' and not \'if\'," said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM.
More complications arose for a possible merger of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank. The European Central Bank will ask Deutsche Bank to raise fresh funds before it gives the go-ahead for the deal, a source told Reuters.
The demand could complicate a bid to create Europe\'s third-largest bank out of Germany\'s top two lenders, who have struggled to recover since the financial crisis.
Commerzbank shares rose nearly 2 percent while those of Deutsche bank dipped.
Hammerson Plc slipped and weighed down the midcap FTSE 250 after Stifel downgraded shares of the British shopping centre operator and Jefferies trimmed its price target.

British Prime Minister Theresa May wrote to European Council President Donald Tusk on Friday asking for a delay of Brexit until up to June 30, but said she still hopes to get Britain out of the EU earlier to avoid it participating in European elections.

BERLIN (AP) - German prosecutors say they have indicted two Indian citizens for spying on the Sikh opposition and Kashmiri separatists in Germany.
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that 50-year-old Manmohan S. is accused of providing information to India\'s foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, from January 2015 onward.
His wife, 51-year-old Kanwal Jit K., allegedly also began cooperating with the spy agency starting in July 2017. Their full names weren\'t released due to German privacy rules.
Prosecutors said the couple is accused of receiving a total of 7,200 euros (about $8,100) for the information they provided to their handler, who was stationed in Germany.


Ilkay Gundogan suggested Manchester City suffer from mental fragility in big matches after their first setback of a hectic run in.
City could not regain composure following Sergio Aguero\xe2\x80\x99s penalty miss, according to Gundogan, and the Champions League quarter-final first leg defeat at Tottenham was a product of nervousness.
The central midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s admission will come as no surprise to Pep Guardiola, who has regularly pointed out that the Premier League champions lack experience.\xc2\xa0
Ilkay Gundogan believes Manchester City are too nervous in big Champions League matches
\xe2\x80\x98We were not brave enough in the game, there were many simple mistakes,\xe2\x80\x99 Gundogan said. \xe2\x80\x98I have the feeling that we are nervous in important Champions League games. We have always made the wrong decisions.\xe2\x80\x99
Guardiola claimed last week that the only difference this season to last has been a comfortable progression through the FA Cup. For him, performances are similar and the Catalan labelled their display at Tottenham \xe2\x80\x98incredible\xe2\x80\x99.
Whether his opinion changed on reviewing the footage on the flight back from London will become clear in the coming days. The element of surprise at this result did bear certain hallmarks of the capitulation at Liverpool in exactly the same fixture last year, although City are in a much healthier position heading for Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s second leg.
Aguero\xe2\x80\x99s miss jolted the players and Gundogan believes those problems lie in the mind. \xe2\x80\x98Such negative experiences always throw us back too much,\xe2\x80\x99 he added. \xe2\x80\x98If we put the penalty in, we would have taken Spurs apart. That\xe2\x80\x99s how we got out of the game. That must not happen to a big team and why we\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet.\xe2\x80\x99
It is easy to forget this was only their second defeat in 24 matches and an historic clean sweep of trophies remains a possibility.
Guardiola\xe2\x80\x99s issues with certain individuals are minor in isolation but those can add up to something more troubling when they all come together at once \xe2\x80\x93 just as they did in the capital.
He knows there are things to fix and not least in attack \xe2\x80\x93 something augmented by the forced absence of Bernardo Silva.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
The Premier League champions were undone by a late Son Heung-min goal against Tottenham
Riyad Mahrez got the nod over Leroy Sane because he keeps hold off the ball with more purpose. Observers are left wondering why Sane has not started a significant match since beating Liverpool in January, while his contract standoff has caused consternation behind the scenes. The offside-prone Gabriel Jesus would surely have started instead of a half-fit Aguero had confidence in him been high.
At left back, the inclusion of Fabian Delph proved a sore spot. Delph has started five of the six games City have lost this season. His presence has waned since a red card in defeat at Leicester over Christmas. Yet Benjamin Mendy was not deemed fit enough to start two games in four days and Guardiola decided against shunting Aymeric Laporte out on the left.
It all makes the case of Aleks Zinchenko a fascinating one. Some around City questioned Zinchenko\xe2\x80\x99s professional vigour last summer when he point-blank refused to leave the club. Now they are left pining for him, completing some turnaround.
This is all before Guardiola even starts thinking about the Centurions\xe2\x80\x99 Player of the Year, Kevin De Bruyne, who readily admits that previous injuries mean he cannot reach his peak. Goalkeeper Ederson faces an anxious wait to hear the extent of his hip injury. Youngster Aro Muric would step in at Crystal Palace on Sunday if required.
The next three matches could define their season and will answer Gundogan\xe2\x80\x99s statement. But Guardiola has been contending with a great deal more for some time. So far, they have dealt with that domestically; whether they can continue as pressure mounts makes the coming weeks captivating.


BRUSSELS, April 10 (Reuters) - France and Italy are divided over policy towards Libya despite the official position of EU unity stated by the bloc\'s foreign policy chief, the head of the European Parliament said on Wednesday.
Parliament President Antonio Tajani, who is Italian, urged EU countries to speak with a single voice on the renewed crisis in Libya, where rival forces are fighting for control of the capital Tripoli.
He also mentioned the role of France and Britain in the overthrow of Libya\'s former ruler Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, a move he said was a mistake that had generated chaos.
"We need more unity, we need to speak with only one voice as Europeans, but unfortunately Europeans are divided on this," he told reporters.
But France and Italy both had "diverging interests," Tajani he said.
France, which has oil assets in eastern Libya, has provided military assistance in past years to Khalifa Haftar in his eastern stronghold, Libyan and French officials say. .
Italy, the former colonial power and a big player in Libya\'s oil sector, has supported the U.N.-backed Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj.

Sport Ireland has confirmed it has suspended funding to the Football Association of Ireland amid concerns over a controversial loan.
Last week, Sport Ireland chief executive John Treacy told an Oireachtas committee his organisation had no knowledge of a \'bridging loan\' made to the FAI by former chief executive John Delaney of 100,000 euro (\xc2\xa387,000) or that the FAI was paying Delaney\'s rent.
Delaney - who officially resigned from the FAI board following on from quitting as chief executive - confirmed last month he gave the association the loan to help it through a short-term cash flow problem, which has since been repaid.
It was a way of protesting against at chief executive John Delaney\'s continued role in the FAI
Sport Ireland, which provides 2.7 million euro (\xc2\xa32.3m) a year for a number of programmes within the FAI, confirmed the decision, also referencing future financial support, in a statement on Tuesday afternoon.
The statement read: \'The Board of Sport Ireland at its meeting today (April 9th) has decided to suspend and withhold future funding to the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) in accordance with Clause 1.1 of Sport Ireland\'s Terms and Conditions of Grant Approval.
\'The decision was taken in light of an acknowledgment by the FAI in its written opening statement to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport tomorrow that in 2017 the FAI did not comply with Clause 4.3 of Sport Ireland\'s Terms & Conditions of Grant Approval.\'
Ireland fans expressed their anger at Delaney\'s role in the ongoing controversy
The statement added: \'In making the decision to suspend and withhold funding, the Board of Sport Ireland notes that the FAI has already been paid 50 percent of its 2019 funding to date and some positive steps taken by the FAI in recent days.
\'This decision will be reviewed by the Board of Sport Ireland as a standing item at each of its future meetings.\'
Sport Ireland said the reinstatement of funding would be considered once the FAI have completed ongoing reports and adopted recommendations but only if \'all necessary processes and controls are in place\' to secure the governing body\'s continued compliance.
The statement further added that Sport Ireland \'will continue to provide non-financial assistance and guidance to the FAI, which may be helpful in advancing matters\'.


BERLIN (AP) - Chancellor Angela Merkel has received former U.S. President Barack Obama at her office in Berlin for a meeting characterized by German officials as a routine private encounter with a former international peer.
Obama could be seen waving as he left the chancellery alongside Merkel Friday. Merkel\'s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she has met repeatedly with ex-heads of state and government "with whom she worked together closely and well for a time."
He said the meeting has no implications for current German-U.S. relations. Asked whether it was a signal to President Donald Trump, with whom Germany has a sometimes-complicated relationship, Seibert replied: "I would firmly reject that impression."
Merkel and Obama have already met in Berlin since the former president left office, participating in a discussion at a May 2017 conference.

Angel Merkel is a leader that has always made her feelings clear.
And now it seems the German chancellor cannot hide her feelings towards US presidents.
Ms Merkel, 64, played host to former US president Barack Obama in Berlin today - and the pair were spotted in a warm embrace after a meeting at the German Chancellery.

This is in stark contrast to the reception she has given President Donald Trump in the past, with an awkward stare across a table being a recent example.\xc2\xa0
Obama, 57, has even said Ms Merkel was one of his \'favourite partners\' during his time in office and his last international trip as president was to Germany in November 2016.
A year later, the former Democratic Party leader told a crowd in Berlin of the \'outstanding work\' across the world Ms Merkel had undertaken.
Obama arrived in Germany yesterday and made a speech to 14,000 people at the World Leadership Summit in Lanxess Arena, Cologne, German newspaper Bild reported.

Today, the pair were believed to have discussed Trans-Atlantic relations during the hour and a half exchange - and Ms Merkel showed her appreciation with a hug and a kiss on Obama\'s cheek.
It comes as a turbulent relationship has evolved between Germany and the US, with President Trump lashing out at Ms Merkel for lowering the country\'s military spending to below Nato targets.
The latest German budget plans, revealed last month, showed defence spending drop well below the two per cent of GDP expected from Nato members.\xc2\xa0
US ambassador Richard Grenell said the cuts were a \'worrisome signal\', while President Trump repeatedly accused Germany of freeloading on US military might.\xc2\xa0
But Ms Merkel rejected the criticism, saying Germany will not cut foreign aid to raise military spending.
Obama arrived yesterday at around 5pm and addressed the World Leadership Summit in Lanxess Arena, Cologne
And this month, President Trump - while complaining about how Germany does not pay its fair share - claimed his father was from the country.\xc2\xa0
Trump repeated an error he has made in public at least twice, this time adding to the story of his father\'s supposed European birth.\xc2\xa0
He made the claim while seated next to Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, the Norwegian politician who has publicly praised the president for encouraging allies to spend more on defence.\xc2\xa0
The president said:\xc2\xa0\'I have great respect for Angela and I have great respect for the country.\'
He added: \'My father is German, right? Was German.
\'Born in a very wonderful place in Germany, so I have a great feeling for Germany.\'\xc2\xa0
But Fred Trump, the president\'s father, was born in New York - it was his grandfather\xc2\xa0Friederich Trump who was born in the German village of Kallstadt.


DUBLIN, April 3 (Reuters) - Ireland plans to support a British request for a short further delay to its European Union exit at a Brussels summit next week, and it is very unlikely Britain will crash out with no deal on April 12, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Wednesday.
"They will look for a short extension next week, and I think Ireland will support that," Coveney told Irish state broadcaster RTE.
"It is very unlikely that there will be any crash out at the end of next week with the prime minister looking for an extension with a plan to go with that," he said. (Reporting by Conor Humphries; Editing by Hugh Lawson)


Fighting in Libya has sparked fears of a fresh migrant influx into Europe as smugglers could take advantage of the unstable government to launch boats across the Med.\xc2\xa0
The Libyan coast guard, operated by UN-backed Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, is one of the main safeguards against smugglers and caught 15,000 migrants last year.
But that government is now in peril as commander Khalifa Hafter\'s forces pushed further into the city on Monday after a weekend of fighting that saw both sides carry out airstrikes around the ruins of the international airport.

Thousands of Libyans displaced by the fighting could also join migrants from sub-Saharan Africa in trying to reach Europe, as the UN warns of \'significant population displacement\'
Commander\xc2\xa0Khalifa Hafter\'s forces pushed further into Tripoli on Monday as he attempts to wrest control of the country from UN-backed\xc2\xa0Fayez al-Sarraj
At least 32 people have been killed in fighting so far with 50 more injured. Many civilians remain trapped by the sudden outburst of violence.\xc2\xa0
Another 2,800 people have been displaced by the fighting, with the UN warning of \'significant population displacement\' if the conflict continues.
Hafter\'s army, which is thought to be backed by Russian mercenaries, advanced rapidly towards the city over the weekend, prompting US forces to retreat.
Who is Khalifa Hafter? Born in 1943 in the eastern town of\xc2\xa0Ajdabiya, Khalifa Hafter was a officer under Gaddafi\'s command when he seized power in 1969. As a reward for his loyalty and service, Gaddafi promoted Hafter to field marshal and put in charge of Libyan forces in Chad. Defeated by French-backed Chadian forces, Hafter was captured in 1987.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Gaddafi, who had long denied the presence of Libyan troops in Chad, cut ties with him - prompting Hafter to vow revenge. During a two-decade exile in the US, Hafter is thought to have plotted with the CIA to overthrow his old master, before returning in 2011 to fight in the uprising against Gaddafi\'s regime. After the Libyan dictator was deposed and killed, Hafter spent time fighting rebels in the east - where he is popular - before seizing key oil supplies from UN-backed groups. Given access to Russian mercenaries who have provided training to his forces, Haftar has now launched an offensive to seize control of the country.
But the advance slowed on Monday as troops moved into urban areas.\xc2\xa0
Meanwhile the EU called for a ceasefire and the resumption of peace talks. French officials also called for a halt to fighting for fresh negotiations.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Renewed civil war in Libya, splintered into areas of factional control since the 2011 overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, also threatens to disrupt oil and gas supplies and allow Islamist militants - such as ISIS militants fresh off the battlefields of Syria - to exploit the chaos.
The eastern Libyan National Army (LNA) forces of Khalifa Haftar, a former officer in Gaddafi\'s army, said 19 of their soldiers had died in recent days as they closed in on the internationally recognised government in Tripoli.\xc2\xa0
The LNA has made air strikes on the south of the city as it seeks to advance into the centre from the disused airport.
But the Tripoli government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj, which reported 11 deaths without specifying on which side, has armed groups arriving from nearby Misrata to block the LNA.
Al-Serraj, 59, who comes from a wealthy business family, has run the Tripoli government since 2016 as part of a U.N.-brokered deal boycotted by Haftar.
The LNA, allied with a parallel eastern administration based in Benghazi, took the oil-rich south of Libya earlier this year before its surprisingly fast push towards the coastal capital.
While that advance was straightforward through mostly sparsely populated areas, taking Tripoli is a far bigger challenge.\xc2\xa0
The violence has thrown into doubt a U.N. plan for an April 14-16 conference to plan elections as a way out of the anarchy since the Western-backed toppling of Gaddafi eight years ago.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the latest international appeal for talks to end the fighting.
The sudden advance of Hafter\'s forces towards Tripoli forced US troops to withdraw on Sunday, along with Indian peacekeepers
Federica Mogherini, the EU\'s foreign policy chief, called for a ceasefire and a return to peace talks on Monday as the conflict raged on
"We have made clear that we oppose the military offensive by Khalifa Haftar\'s forces and urge the immediate halt to these military operations against the Libyan capital," he said.
A contingent of U.S. forces evacuated at the weekend.
The U.N. mission to Libya called on Sunday for a truce for two hours in southern Tripoli to evacuate civilians and wounded, but it did not appear to have been heeded.
Haftar casts himself as a foe of extremism but is viewed by opponents as a new dictator in the mould of Gaddafi, whose four-decade rule saw torture, disappearances and assassinations.
Haftar enjoys the backing of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, which see him as a bulwark against Islamists and have supported him militarily, according to U.N. reports.
Forces with the Tripoli government have announced an operation to defence the capital called "Volcano of Anger".
Allied groups from Misrata down the coast have been moving pickup trucks fitted with machine guns into Tripoli.
The LNA says it has 85,000 men but this includes soldiers paid by the central government that it hopes to inherit. Its elite force, Saiqa (Lightning), numbers some 3,500, while Haftar\'s sons also have well-equipped troops, LNA sources say.
Since NATO-backed rebels ousted Gaddafi, Libya has been a transit point for hundreds of thousands of migrants trekking across the Sahara in hope of reaching Europe across the sea.
Libya since Gaddafi: How the country went from liberation to the brink of civil war Libya has been mired in chaos since the ouster and killing of dictator Colonel Gaddafi in 2011, with two rival authorities and a multitude of militias vying for control of the oil-rich country. Strongman Khalifa Haftar\'s forces were pushed back Friday from a key checkpoint less than 30 kilometres (18 miles) from Tripoli, checking their lightning advance on the capital, seat of the country\'s internationally recognised unity government. Haftar supports a parallel administration based in the east. Here is a timeline of the Mediterranean country\'s descent into turmoil: Former dictator Colonel Gaddafi was the Libyan leader from 1969 until 2011. During the Libyan civil war the government was overthrown, and Gaddafi retreated to Sirte, only to be captured and killed Gaddafi killed Triggered by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, demonstrations erupt in Libya in February 2011. A coalition led by Washington, Paris and London lends its backing to an armed revolt. Gaddafi, in power for 42 years, flees the capital. He is captured and killed on October 20, 2011 during a battle for his hometown Sirte, east of Tripoli. Three days later, the rebel National Transitional Council (NTC) declares Libya\'s \'total liberation\'. In August 2012 the NTC hands power to a transitional authority elected a month earlier - the General National Congress (GNC). Embassies targeted US ambassador Chris Stevens and three American staff are killed in a September 11, 2012 attack on their consulate in Libya\'s second city Benghazi. An Al-Qaeda-linked jihadist group is blamed. A car bomb in April 2013 targets France\'s embassy in Tripoli, wounding two French guards. Most foreign delegations withdraw from the country. Rival governments Dissident army general Haftar launches an offensive in May 2014 against jihadist groups in Benghazi. He is backed by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Several military officers from the east join his self-styled Libyan National Army. As nationalists and Islamists vie for power, legislative elections are held in June and the GNC is replaced by a parliament dominated by anti-Islamists. Islamist-led militias contest the results and group under the banner of \'Fajr Libya\' (Libya Dawn). They storm Tripoli in August, installing their own \'national salvation\' government and restoring the GNC. The elected house, which has international recognition, takes refuge in the eastern city of Tobruk near the border with Egypt. Thus the country finds itself with two governments and two parliaments. After months of negotiations and international pressure, lawmakers from the rival parliaments sign an accord in December 2015 in Morocco to set up a UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA). In March 2016, GNA chief Fayez al-Sarraj arrives in Tripoli to set up the new government, but Haftar\'s rival administration refuses to recognise its authority. Peace talks, armed groups In July 2017, Sarraj and Haftar meet for talks near Paris where they agree to a ceasefire and commit to elections the following year. In May 2018, weeks after suicide attackers from the Islamic State group kill 14 people at Libya\'s electoral commission, the two men meet again in the French capital and commit to holding parliamentary and presidential polls at the end of the year. In June 2018, a militia attacks two northeastern oil sites under Haftar\'s control through which oil is exported. After days of fighting, Haftar\'s forces announce they are back in \'full control\' and have also seized the city of Derna from radical Islamists. In January 2019 Haftar launches an offensive into oil-rich southern Libya, ostensibly aimed at wiping out \'terrorists\' and criminal groups. His forces seize the region\'s capital Sebha and one of the country\'s main oil fields without a fight. Conferences On February 28 the UN says Libya\'s rivals have met and agreed to hold polls. In March the UN says it will organise an all-party conference the next month to draw up a \'road map\' for Libya, including setting dates for legislative and presidential elections. Later in March the African Union says it will host a \'reconciliation\' conference in July aimed at uniting Libya\'s political rivals. Advance on Tripoli On Wednesday, Haftar\'s forces announce they are gearing up to move on the west of the country including Tripoli. A day later powerful armed groups from the western city of Misrata, loyal to the Tripoli government, vow to block the threatened advance. UN chief Antonio Guterres expresses deep concern over the risk of a major flare-up in Libya. Haftar orders his troops to advance on Tripoli, saying \'the time has come\'. The strongman\'s forces seize a key security barrier within 27 kilometres of the capital later that day without any fighting, General Abdessalem al-Hassi says. But on Friday, a security source says militiamen from the nearby coastal town of Zawiya retake the base after \'a short exchange of fire\'.\xc2\xa0

The former deputy speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly is to stand in the European elections if they take place in Northern Ireland.
Jane Morrice, the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Coalition founder and peacemaking expert, said it was her duty to speak out against the \xe2\x80\x9charmful\xe2\x80\x9d effects of the UK\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal from the EU.
The UK has begun making preparations to hold a poll next month, but will cancel the elections if Brexit happens before then.
Ms Morrice said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the elections to the European Parliament give me the opportunity to find ways to reduce the harm of Brexit on Northern Ireland, I must stand up and be counted.\xe2\x80\x9d
She describes herself as a \xe2\x80\x9cdedicated and devoted European\xe2\x80\x9d, and would enter the race as an independent candidate.
She added: \xe2\x80\x9cBrexit is bad for Northern Ireland.

\xe2\x80\x9cIt threatens the political, economic and social fabric of our society and could serve to halt, even reverse, our hard-won peace process.
\xe2\x80\x9cAs an elected member of the European Parliament, standing as an independent, I will do everything in my power to ensure that does not happen.\xe2\x80\x9d
She was one of the architects of the first multimillion-pound EU Peace Programme in Northern Ireland, in her role as head of the European Commission office in Belfast.
She has campaigned to keep EU funding for peace in Northern Ireland.
Ms Morrice added: \xe2\x80\x9cWith increasing calls for independence in Scotland and a border poll in Ireland, Brexit is not only bad for economic, social and political progress in Northern Ireland.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt also threatens the break up of the United Kingdom.
\xe2\x80\x9cThose who back Brexit must recognise this risk and find ways to reduce its negative impact by supporting my proposal to keep Northern Ireland in the EU as part of the UK \xe2\x80\x93 and putting the new deal to the people, with an option for the UK to remain.\xe2\x80\x9d
After the Brexit referendum, she launched a petition calling for Northern Ireland to be given honorary EU association as a European place of global peace-building.
It has attracted 6,500 signatures.
She backed calls for a second referendum.
She said any deal \xe2\x80\x9cmust contain a safety net for Northern Ireland which will secure our economic progress and prosperity by giving us the best of both worlds and, above all, protect our precious peace process\xe2\x80\x9d.
She said her track record in politics, working within the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Coalition on the fringes of the Good Friday Agreement negotiations and as deputy speaker of the first Stormont Assembly, was proof of her determination to make Northern Ireland a better place for everyone.


British passports without the words European Union on the front cover have been issued despite the Brexit delay.
The burgundy passports were introduced from March 30 - the day after Britain was expected to leave the EU.
Some passports including the words European Union will continue to be issued while the remaining stock is used up.
But those applying for a new travel document will not be able to choose between the two.
British passports without the words European Union on the front cover have been issued despite the Brexit delay. The burgundy passports were introduced from March 30 - the day after Britain was expected to leave the EU
Susan Hindle Barone, who picked up her new passport on Friday, said on Twitter she was \'truly appalled\'.
\'I was just surprised - we\'re still members of the EU,\' she told the Press Association.
\'I was surprised they\'ve made the change when we haven\'t left, and it\'s a tangible mark of something which I believe to be completely futile. What do we gain by leaving? There\'s certainly a whole lot we lose.\'
She added: \'Let\'s face it, it\'s not the changes to the passport - it\'s just symbolic.
\'What really matters are the potential changes to our country - the damage to the economy, our communities and our international standing.\'
The decision to remove the words was made in anticipation of Britain leaving the EU at the end of last month.
\'There will be no difference for British citizens whether they are using a passport that includes the words European Union, or a passport that does not. Both designs will be equally valid for travel,\' a\xc2\xa0Home Office spokeswoman said
Dark blue passports are scheduled to be issued from the end of this year.
A Home Office spokeswoman said: \'Burgundy passports that no longer include the words European Union on the front cover were introduced from 30 March 2019.
\'In order to use leftover stock and achieve best value to the taxpayer, passports that include the words European Union will continue to be issued for a short period after this date.
\'There will be no difference for British citizens whether they are using a passport that includes the words European Union, or a passport that does not. Both designs will be equally valid for travel.\'


A hard border would be \xe2\x80\x9cflabbergasting\xe2\x80\x9d for people in the north west of Ireland, the leader of Donegal Council has said.
Seamus O\xe2\x80\x99Domhnaill made the point not only in terms of the fluid movement of people across the border on a daily basis but also in terms of supporting the two hospitals in Donegal and Londonderry and\xc2\xa0students.
He said Donegal shares a much longer land border with Derry, compared with the \xe2\x80\x9cumbilical cord\xe2\x80\x9d it shares with the rest of the Republic of Ireland.

Mr\xc2\xa0O\xe2\x80\x99Domhnaill was speaking as he led a delegation from both Donegal County and Derry and Strabane District Councils to present to an Irish Government committee.
He told the Joint Committee for the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in Dublin\xc2\xa0that today alone he had already\xc2\xa0crossed the border twice.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a somewhat frustrating time with much fear from the people in that region because consequences of decisions that will be made or won\xe2\x80\x99t be made at Westminster will impact more on the region than any other region in Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.
\xe2\x80\x9cFor instance when I came down here today, I crossed the border at Lifford into Strabane, but equally from Donegal you have to come back out of the north, so you have to cross it twice to come to Dublin which is our capital city.

\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if we look at the demography and geography of Donegal, our largest land border is with the six counties, only 3% of our land border is actually with the Republic of Ireland. We are but tied to the Republic of Ireland by an umbilical cord, and it is important that the border that we have with the six counties is cherished, that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t weakened and that nothing by way of stopping progress or collaboration can be drawn up.
\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter what happens or what deal, no matter how good that deal is, it will not be as good as what is currently in place.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe hear talk of green cards, we hear talk of people being worried about insurance, but if we delve more into it about healthcare, education, about the free movement of people and goods, and tariffs, that\xe2\x80\x99s frightening stuff for us in Donegal and Derry.
A banner reading "Derry voted Remain" hung from the city\xc2\xb4s walls. (Niall Carson/PA)
\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something when you talk about it in a real way and how it will impact on normal day to day lives, it is totally profound and flabbergasting.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt is important that whatever negotiations or talks are had by anyone about Brexit, the real impacts that will affect the people from our region are taken into consideration and that the people who are making those decisions know they are making decisions that are going to change lives for the people from our region.\xe2\x80\x9d
Mr\xc2\xa0O\xe2\x80\x99Domhnaill also urged the committee for support in pressing for the long anticipated upgrade of the A5, pointing out that with no railways, Donegal is almost entirely dependent on roads.
\xe2\x80\x9cIf we look at a map of this island, the only area that is not connected by major motorway or dual carriage is the north west, and this is something we are going to fall further behind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.
\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you look at the impending decisions to be taken in terms of Brexit, it puts us at a serious disadvantage.\xe2\x80\x9d


FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - The European Central Bank has left its policy promises and interest rates unchanged as it weighs looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
The ECB has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve in pausing the withdrawal of stimulus measures deployed over a decade to bounce back from the global financial crisis, as central bankers around the world ponder which way the economy is headed. The Fed has already started raising rates but has backed off plans for further rate increases in 2019.
The ECB\'s 25-member governing council was content to stand pat on Thursday, making no changes to its short policy statement. The bank took several steps to support the economy on March 7. Those including extending the date for the earliest interest rate increase to the end of the year and a promise of a new round of cheap loans for banks to help boost their ability to lend to businesses and support growth.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a post-meeting news conference, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more supportive steps in coming months.
Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for a first interest rate increase, which currently is not before the end of this year.

The bank could also take steps to ease the side effects from its negative rate on deposits it takes from banks. The rate is currently at minus 0.4%, a penalty aimed at discouraging banks from leaving unused funds piled up at the central bank and to take the risk of lending the money instead. Draghi said on March 27 that the bank was looking at ways to mitigate the side effects on bank finances of that particular stimulus measure, but did not accept that the negative rate inevitably hurts bank profits.
One way to ease the pain for banks would be to apply the negative rate only to deposits over a certain level. That could help avoid spooking markets by raising the negative rate outright at a time when the ECB is trying to reassure markets that it is not going to prematurely withdraw stimulus at a time of heightened uncertainty.
The European economy slowed at the end of last year, held back by weakness in Germany due to troubles in the auto industry and low river levels that blocked transport and hurt production. Several economists see things improving this year - if trade and Brexit risks do not hurt growth. The European Commission forecasts growth of 1.3% for all of 2019. Unemployment is down to 7.8% from a peak of 12.1% in 2013, helping domestic demand for goods and services.
Threats to the eurozone were underlined Tuesday when the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth this year to 3.3% from 3.5%.
Slowing trade is a factor. Business confidence has been hurt by uncertainty over whether the US and China will settle their trade disputes or add more tariffs on goods.
Another key risk is whether Britain will make a messy exit from the European Union without approval on a withdrawal deal to smooth the process. That could disrupt flows of parts and goods. European leaders were due to meet Wednesday to discuss a possible extension to Britain\'s departure, currently slated for 11 p.m. British time on Friday if no extension is agreed.


As the young Arsenal forward Reiss Nelson made the drive from the university town of Heidelberg, cutting through the sparse villages of Hoffenheim and pulling into his loan club\xe2\x80\x99s Zuzenhausen training complex, the sense of foreboding arrived.
\xe2\x80\x98You are surrounded by all these trees,\xe2\x80\x99 smiles the 19-year-old winger. \xe2\x80\x98I was just thinking \xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I going to?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0
It seems very small but it opens up into a beautiful modern place and you are kind of surprised. But then I got into the changing room. All the guys are speaking German and I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d
Young Arsenal forward Reiss Nelson has been making quite an impression on loan in Germany
In previous times, a young English player, so out of their comfort zone, may have scrambled for the fastest escape route.
Hoffenheim, after all, is far removed from the fast and furious pace of life in South London.
Nelson grew up in the maligned Aylesbury Estate made famous by Tony Blair\xe2\x80\x99s first speech as Prime Minister in 1997.\xc2\xa0
When Blair visited Aylesbury, the estate was the lightning rod for him to declare that the \xe2\x80\x98poorest people in our country have been forgotten\xe2\x80\x99. The ITV crime soap The Bill used it as a gritty shooting location. For Nelson, it was simply home.
The 19-year-old moved out of his comfort zone to get first team action with Hoffenheim
Nelson admits he was initially daunted and could not understand what his team-mates said
\xe2\x80\x98Where I come from, the estates are not so nice,\xe2\x80\x99 Nelson says. \xe2\x80\x98It is a bit gritty. On my estate, there are dangerous things happening.
\xe2\x80\x98But I had my ball with me and that made me feel safe. I just went out to play. Street football...That\xe2\x80\x99s where I developed my strength, mentality and ruthlessness.
\xe2\x80\x98I have an elder brother who adores me and pushed me on. He just said \xe2\x80\x9cGo out and play\xe2\x80\x9d. My family made big sacrifices but little gestures mean a lot. My sister took me to training when she was pregnant.\xc2\xa0
\'My brother-in-law skipped work to get me to training. Our family get us through. We\xe2\x80\x99d get the train, a bus and sometimes even walk to training. I\xe2\x80\x99m just so happy it\xe2\x80\x99s working out.\xe2\x80\x99
Nelson is part of an English cohort talent defined by courage, self-confidence and open minds.\xc2\xa0
Nelson remains close friends with Borussia Dortmund\xe2\x80\x99s Jadon Sancho, a product of their shared upbringing in Kennington and subsequent German adventures. The pair represented Southwark together as Under-11\xe2\x80\x99s in the London Youth Games.
Nelson signed a new long-term contract at Arsenal last summer and impressed on the club\xe2\x80\x99s pre-season tour of Singapore. In the search for first-team football, he plumped for a season in Germany and the results were initially explosive.\xc2\xa0
Nelson scored on his debut and struck six goals in his first seven Bundesliga appearances. His progress has since been hampered by injury but the club\xe2\x80\x99s director Alexander Rosen calls Nelson \xe2\x80\x98really incredible\xe2\x80\x99.
Gareth Southgate\'s assistant has made trips over to Germany specifically to see Nelson play
Nelson grew up playing with Jadon Sancho and is hoping to make a similarly big impression
\xe2\x80\x98The intensity has made me better,\xe2\x80\x99 Nelson says. \xe2\x80\x98On my debut, the ball went over the top and I just heard everyone shouting \xe2\x80\x98Weiter, weiter, weiter\xe2\x80\x99.. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what they were talking about! I realised it meant run, run, press, press. That\xe2\x80\x99s the intensity you want.
\xe2\x80\x98I went very deep to pick up the ball in our own half and I tried to turn. A defender clattered me. I was confused, dizzy, then the ball was bouncing. I went to chase it and another player kicked the ball straight in my face. I remember falling to the floor and I think the captain grabbed me and just threw me...I was thinking \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he doing?\xe2\x80\x9d Two minutes later, I scored so I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that!\xe2\x80\x99
Along with Sancho at Borussia Dortmund, Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s contribution has tightened the gaze of German clubs towards Premier League academies.\xc2\xa0
In turn, young English talent know the statistics. Players aged below 22 have enjoyed 71,208 minutes of top-flight football in Germany this season, compared to 47,600 in the Premier League.\xc2\xa0
At Hoffenheim, Nelson has benefited from the coaching of 31-year-old manager Julian Nagelsmann and the club\xe2\x80\x99s hi-tech innovations. These include scheduled sessions of gaming to improve cognitive reaction times and aeroplane pilot-style response drills. He lives in nearby Heidelberg, spending his time with visiting family members or bowling with his new team-mates.
\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not very good at bowling...but of course I have the bumpers down,\xe2\x80\x99 he grins.
Within the corridors of power at Arsenal, Nelson has long been touted as another pearl mined from the South London production line.
The youngster is seen as the next pearl mined from south London production line of talent
He trained alongside the Arsenal first-team at the age of fifteen under Arsene Wenger but the first overtures came from rivals Tottenham. A midnight battle ensued for the gifted eight-year-old.
Nelson says: \xe2\x80\x98My brother-in-law was a Tottenham fan. He introduced me to football and brought me to Tottenham. At the time I just wanted to play football so I would go anywhere to play.\xc2\xa0
\'I was there on trial for two weeks. I had a game, played well and then I got home that night and I had a lot of teams calling me. It was so late, and I had school the next morning, but at 12 o\xe2\x80\x99clock Arsenal called and I went directly in the morning to the training ground.\xc2\xa0
\'Arsenal was my dream club, so I would have been kicking myself if I turned that down. I had Thierry Henry\xe2\x80\x99s name on the back of my shirts. Then he was the coach of our under-19 squad. His main thing was staying grounded.\xc2\xa0
\'A lot of kids, when they get to 18 or 19, they start getting flashy and forgetting about the real basics of being a professional footballer. He has always said \xe2\x80\x9cBe on that and you\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the top\xe2\x80\x9d.
Nelson grew up an Arsenal supporter and had no hesitation when the club wanted to take him
Henry\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in Nelson is shared by the England set-up. Manager Gareth Southgate has highlighted Nelson as another forward likely to break into the senior set-up. Earlier this season, Southgate\xe2\x80\x99s assistant Steve Holland paid a personal visit to Nelson in Hoffenheim.
The interest clearly meant much to the young winger. \xe2\x80\x98He came to the training ground. We showed him round and he watched the game. He said I\xe2\x80\x99ve just got to keep performing, and hopefully I can get there in the end. Every young kid dreams to play for their country.
\xe2\x80\x98I am just at the beginning. I want to get to the very top. My family deserve everything they will get.\xc2\xa0
\'For them to see me now in an Arsenal shirt and a Hoffenheim shirt, scoring my first goal here, they were literally in tears. It can only get better. I just need to stay loyal to God and anything can happen.\xe2\x80\x99


A humanitarian vessel with 64 rescued migrants was left stuck in the Mediterranean after Italy\'s Matteo Salvini said it could \'go to Hamburg.\'
Malta refused the ship entry to their waters as it sailed close to the Italian island of Lampedusa on Thursday after the migrants were hauled from the sea on Wednesday.
The Maltese and Italian refusal sets the stage for another Mediterranean stand-off that will only be resolved if European governments agree to accept the asylum-seekers.
Italian Interior Minister Salvini stated on Wednesday the ship could head to Germany but Sea Eye\'s spokeswoman said that was \'out of the question.\'

Carlotta Weibl\xc2\xa0said \'it\'s a journey of 3-4 weeks. We don\'t have food and water.\'\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Weibl said: \'Malta says we can\'t enter their waters and we are unlikely to get permission from Italy.\'

It did so as it was looking for a boat with 50 migrants missing since Monday and 40 migrants missing since last week.
\'The chances are low that they are alive,\' Weibl said.
Similar stand-offs in recent months involving rescue ships hoping to reach Italy and Malta were eventually resolved when other EU members agreed to take some of the migrants.
However, many of those people still remain stuck in migrant centres in Malta and Lampedusa.
The Alan Kurdi ship is named after a Kurdish boy who drowned in the sea at the age of three in 2015 as he and his family fled war in Syria.

An image of his small lifeless body prompted an outpouring of sympathy for the plight of migrants.
However, since then the mood in Europe has turned.
Weibl said that at the moment, the Alan Kurdi is the only humanitarian ship operating in the Mediterranean because many governments have denied aid ships the permission to operate.

LISBON, April 5 (Reuters) - Plans to reform and possible expand European club competition ran into opposition on Friday as the continent\'s leagues declared they were \'united\' in their determination to protect domestic football.
The European Leagues umbrella group said it would take a more active role in influencing public opinion and shaping the future of football on the continent and reiterated its claim that fans prefer domestic league action to UEFA competition.
Meanwhile, the English Premier League, one of the European Leagues\' 35 members, said its 20 clubs would "vigorously defend" it against any plans to impose a new calendar.
UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said on being re-elected in February that he would work with the European Club Association (ECA), which groups 232 of the region\'s biggest clubs, to "design the club competitions of the future."
The ECA, in turn, said it wanted more teams playing more matches in continental competitions.
European Leagues, which says it represents 900-plus clubs through its affiliates including "those who are not normally playing European football", said domestic football should remain the priority.
"Our main objective is to safeguard the domestic competitions and protect the domestic competitions if needed," its president Lars-Christer Olsson told a news conference.
"These are the most important to the fans, they are much more important than any international competitions."
Olsson added: "These are interesting times. When it comes to real issues, I am happy to see all leagues are united."
Although UEFA has only just started discussing its plans, Olsson said it was important that the public knew what was happening.
"We have to make the views of the European Leagues known to everyone, not only stakeholders but also fans and the public so everyone knows what is going on and how we are preparing for the future club competitions," he said.
Olsson added that the last 10 years had been negative for domestic leagues as revenue from UEFA competition had increased the gap between the richest clubs and the rest.
The Premier League said that in a statement that it had "significant concerns" over reported plans to change the format and qualifying criteria for European tournaments.
"All clubs unanimously agreed it is inappropriate for European football bodies to create plans that would alter the structures, calendar and competitiveness of the domestic game and will work together to protect the Premier League," it said.
"We have a fantastic combination of competitive football and committed fans that we will vigorously defend," it continued, adding that allegiances and local rivalries were often passed down through generations.
The Premier League said it would ensure that "European football bodies understand the importance of this, and their obligation to maintain the health and sustainability of domestic league football." (Writing by Brian Homewood Editing by Christian Radnedge)


VATICAN CITY (AP) - Pope Francis has blamed Europe and the United States for selling weapons in war zones, fueling conflicts and causing victims in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.
Speaking to students and teachers of Milan\'s San Carlo Institute on Saturday, the pope said that the reason why there are so many wars around the world is that "the rich Europe and America sell weapons ... used to kill children and kill people."
Francis also added that, without weapons, countries like Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan wouldn\'t be at war.
The pontiff said that "a country that produces and sells weapons has on its conscience the death of every child and the destruction of each family. It\'s us that make a difference."

April 1 (Reuters) - European shares kicked off the second quarter on an upbeat note on Monday with all major sectors higher following a surprise recovery in China\'s factory data and signs of progress in trade talks between the world\'s two largest economies.
At 0715 GMT, the pan-European index had risen 0.8 percent. While gains spread across all regional bourses, Germany\'s trade sensitive DAX outperformed with its 1 percent rise, helped by rising car maker stocks.
PSA Group rose 3.3 percent and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles gained 2 percent on a report that the two companies are exploring a partnership to share investments to build cars in Europe.
European chipmakers were another bright spot after better-than-expected results from Apple-supplier Foxconn Industrial. Dialog Semiconductor Plc and Infineon Technologies rose more than 3 percent each.
Meanwhile, factory activity in China unexpectedly grew for the first time in four months in March, both official and private surveys showed, suggesting government stimulus measures may be starting to take hold.
China\'s economic data comes on the heels of fresh concerns over a slowing world economy that resurfaced last month after the U.S. Federal Reserve abruptly ended its plans for policy tightening this year.
Also on investors\' radar on Monday were similar activity surveys out of the euro zone.
Adding to the cheery mood, China\'s State Council said over the weekend that the country would continue to suspend additional tariffs on U.S. vehicles and auto parts after April 1, in a goodwill gesture following a U.S. decision to delay tariff hikes on Chinese imports.
Denmark\'s DSV A/S dipped 0.6 percent after Swiss freight forwarder Panalpina said DSV would buy it in a share swap valued at 4.6 billion Swiss francs ($4.62 billion).
EasyJet slipped 6.2 percent, among the biggest decliners on STOXX, after the British low-cost airline said macroeconomic uncertainty and many unanswered questions surrounding Brexit were driving weaker customer demand in the market, hurting ticket yields across Europe.
Ryanair Holdings London shares also shed 3.2 percent.
London\'s FTSE 100 eked out the smallest gain while the Dublin bourse, often seen as a barometer for Brexit sentiment, rose 0.8 percent.
Britain\'s exit from the European Union was in disarray after a third defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May\'s divorce deal left her under pressure from rival factions to leave without a deal, go for an election or forge a much softer divorce.

BRUSSELS/LONDON, April 2 (Reuters) - The European Union has not raised any major concerns about the impact on Germany\'s cable market of Vodafone buying Liberty Global\'s assets, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday, improving the chances of the deal going ahead.
Vodafone, the world\'s No.2 mobile operator, agreed in May to pay $22 billion for Liberty Global\'s cable networks in Germany and eastern European markets to challenge the dominance of former monopolies such as Deutsche Telekom.
In December, the EU opened a full-scale probe into the deal, which has been strongly criticised by rivals Deutsche Telekom and Telefonica Deutschland.
Antitrust regulators said at the time they were concerned the deal would damage competition in Germany and the Czech Republic.
Two sources, however, said the EU had accepted Vodafone\'s Kabel Deutschland and Liberty\'s Unitymedia cable networks, which serve different regions of Germany, were unlikely to ever overlap and so competition would not be reduced if they combined.
"That is no longer on the table," one of the sources said.
INFLUENCE ON BROADCASTERS
The Vodafone and Liberty cable assets used to belong to Deutsche Telekom and were broken up at the behest of the regulator when they were sold.
Competitors complain the proposed deal would recreate a dominant player in serving apartment buildings, where one gatekeeper typically controls access to multiple households.
Regulators, however, accepted there wasn\'t direct competition between Vodafone and Liberty when they were offering TV services to housing associations, the source said.
There were also no major EU concerns about the impact in the Czech Republic of combining fixed line and mobile services.
The EU said in December it would look into whether the combined group could have too much power in the Czech Republic through its ability to offer mobile, broadband and TV services.
That has been dropped from the so-called statement of objections issued to the companies, another source said.
The EU still has outstanding worries about a few areas of overlap, including Vodafone reselling broadband that uses Deutsche Telekom\'s network in the areas covered by Liberty\'s cable network, one of the sources said.
The other issues concerned the increased influence the combined group would have on the broadcasters that supply programming, and the wholesale supply of TV to smaller operators.
Shares in Vodafone were up 0.2 percent at 1472 pence by 1405 GMT, while Liberty Global\'s were up 0.3 percent at $24.98.
Guy Peddy, head of telecoms research at Macquarie, said he continued to expect the deal would be completed in the middle of the year.
Vodafone said it was in constructive dialogue with the European Commission about the deal, which also includes operations in Hungary and Romania.
"This is a significant, pan-European transaction that will create a fully-converged national challenger in four European markets, and we remain confident that the Commission will recognise that it will deliver considerable benefits for consumers and competition," the company said in a statement.
"We still expect to receive final approval in the middle of this year."
Liberty Global was not immediately available to comment.
The European Commission declined to comment. (Additional reporting by Douglas Busvine in Frankfurt. Editing by Georgina Prodhan and Mark Potter)


Business activity in Northern Ireland has dropped for the first time in almost three years, with Brexit uncertainty blamed for the decline.
The Purchasing Managers\xe2\x80\x99 Index, a well-established benchmarked index for measuring private sector growth, has recorded a decrease in activity for the first time since July 2016.
Rates of employment and new orders in the sector are also on a downward trajectory, the data from the Ulster Bank Northern Ireland PMI.
Richard Ramsey, chief economist with Ulster Bank Northern Ireland, said the region\xe2\x80\x99s firms were becoming increasingly pessimistic about what lies ahead in 2019.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe term Brexit Uncertainty has been overused in the last couple of years, however it is again a major feature of the latest PMI, with the impact of this becoming more and more tangible,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.

\xe2\x80\x9cBusiness conditions deteriorated further according to respondents, with March seeing the first fall in business activity in 32-months.
\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps more significantly though, export orders and employment levels both dropped at their fastest rate in almost six years, and Northern Ireland firms are increasingly pessimistic about the year ahead.
\xe2\x80\x9cClearly the potential for a no-deal scenario was exercising the minds of business owners last month.
\xe2\x80\x9cPositives were in short supply in the latest survey with manufacturing continuing to be the only sector recording output growth; albeit that stockpiling was no doubt a factor.
\xe2\x80\x9cThis is seen in the UK Manufacturing PMI, where stockpiling was reported to be rising at its fastest rate in 27 years.
\xe2\x80\x9cAt the other end of the spectrum locally is retail, with sales activity declining at its sharpest rate in four years.
\xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile, Northern Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s largest sector, the service industry, took a turn for the worse in March, with output, orders and employment all going lower.
\xe2\x80\x9cService sector activity hit a 32-month low and staffing levels in the sector are falling at the fastest rate in almost six and a half years.
\xe2\x80\x9cLast month marked the end of the first quarter of the year, and the deteriorating picture in March meant that it was the weakest quarter in terms of output since Q3 2016.
\xe2\x80\x9cMore significantly though, employment and exports had their worst quarter since the first half of 2013.\xe2\x80\x9d
Mr Ramsey said the UK as a whole was struggling on the growth front.
\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed this picture is consistent in Europe as well, where Germany for instance, is seeing manufacturing activity falling at a rapid rate,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.
\xe2\x80\x9cNorthern Ireland, though, differs from the rest of the UK in that there has been a lack of decision-making on two fronts, with the absence of an Executive adding to the complications created by uncertainty over Brexit.
\xe2\x80\x9cThis has driven a declining picture regarding confidence, with Northern Ireland respondents, particularly in the construction sector, the most pessimistic in the UK regarding future output.
\xe2\x80\x9cWith the prospect of a no-deal Brexit receding and decisions in relation to some key infrastructure projects now being made in Northern Ireland, it remains to be seen whether some optimism returns in the months ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d
The March PMI report was produced for Ulster Bank by IHS Markit.


JOHANNESBURG (AP) - The migration of Africans to Europe and North America should be viewed as a positive phenomenon, not a threat, Sudan-born billionaire Mo Ibrahim said Sunday.
Experts said at a weekend conference hosted by Ibrahim\'s foundation in Abidjan, Ivory Coast that Africans make up about 14% of the global migrant population, a much smaller share than the 41% from Asia and 23% from Europe.
"Migration is healthy. It\'s not a disease," Ibrahim told The Associated Press in an interview. "Migration is about aspirations, not desperation. People who migrate are mostly capable, ambitious young people who are migrating to work and to build successful lives. They add wealth to the countries they go to."
Ibrahim also cited statistics to rebut anti-migration politicians who say Africans have inundated Europe.
"Europe is not being flooded by Africans," Ibrahim said, citing statistics that show 70% of African migrants relocate within Africa.
The 72-year-old philanthropist earned his fortune by establishing the Celtel mobile phone network across Africa.

Now living in Britain, he says African countries should have better education and employment opportunities for their young.
"Farming should be sexy. It should be seen as profitable and productive, not a backward thing," said Ibrahim. "Yes, IT and technology are important, but agriculture is a way of the future for Africa."
Ibrahim\'s foundation publishes an annual index and awards a leadership prize to encourage good governance in Africa.


The Irish Government has been urged to launch legacy investigations into Troubles killings that took place in its jurisdiction.
Northern Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s Victims Commissioner Judith Thompson made her first presentation on legacy proposals at Leinster House on Thursday.
Among her recommendations was for Ireland to establish a mechanism similar to the proposed Historical Investigations Unit in Northern Ireland to carry out investigations into incidents that took place in the Irish Republic.

She also urged that legislation allowing effective information sharing for legacy inquests is established, and that transparent processes and a robust appeals system are in place around national security to help build trust with families.
A number of incidents related to Northern Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s troubled past took place in the Irish Republic.
These include the killing of 34 people on May 17 1974 after the Ulster Volunteer Force planted a series of bombs in Dublin and Monaghan and\xc2\xa0the IRA\xe2\x80\x99s murder of Lord Mountbatten and three others in Sligo in 1979.

On Thursday, Ms Thompson made a presentation to the Oireachtas committee on the Good Friday Agreement, and urged they use their influence to press the Irish Government on the matter.
She told the committee that there was a sense of isolation and inequality felt by victims who live outside Northern Ireland.
\xe2\x80\x9cI believe there is a good understanding of the issues, I believe there is a sense of it being very difficult to move on,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms Thompson told the committee.
\xe2\x80\x9cI need to be more reassured that both governments feel that this is something that is not only important but urgent and doable.\xe2\x80\x9d

There have been proposals to establish a Historical Investigations Unit as well as an Independent Commission on Information Retrieval and an Oral History Archive.
Ms Thompson said she does not believe many convictions will be secured, but said having investigations is important for bereaved families.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe purpose of historical investigations should not be defined narrowly in terms of numbers of prosecutions,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.
\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not really primarily in the end what these investigations need to deliver, it is evident from previous and ongoing investigations, new information and evidence can be uncovered and that families who want answers can be better served than they have been, even if the evidence, as is likely in many cases, is insufficient to secure a conviction.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe critical issue for many families and communities as well is access to information about the circumstances leading to the death of people they love, and acknowledgement of the harm that has been done to them.\xe2\x80\x9d
Independent TD Maureen O\xe2\x80\x99Sullivan, who\xc2\xa0chairs Justice for the Forgotten which represents survivors and families of the victims of the May 1974 blasts, commended Ms Thompson.
\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you are saying is so true to their story, their experience and what they have been looking for, they have been waiting 46 years now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.
The issue of the definition of a victim, which has sparked rows over whether perpetrators should be included, was raised by\xc2\xa0Fermanagh MP Michelle Gildernew.
During her contribution, the Sinn Fein MP revealed she was diagnosed with PTSD in 2013 \xe2\x80\x9cas a result of the conflict\xe2\x80\x9d.
Ms Gildernew said while the Dublin and Monaghan bombings \xe2\x80\x9cunderstandably get a lot of attention\xe2\x80\x9d, she said there were also bomb attacks in Cavan.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe pain of those families is the exact same of Jonathan Parry\xe2\x80\x99s, anybody who has lost a loved one knows what it feels like to be a victim,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.
\xe2\x80\x9cTo that end is there any progress on the definition of a victim\xe2\x80\x9d.
Ms Thompson responded: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a definition in law which is the one I operate under which is an inclusive definition.
\xe2\x80\x9cI understand why that is difficult for some people and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is a perfect definition, however I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a perfect definition would look like and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think a conversation about who should be excluded from consideration of their pain is a healthy one to have as a way of dealing with the past.\xe2\x80\x9d

BERLIN (AP) - The German government says greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2% in 2018, the first major decrease in four years.
Estimates published Tuesday by the Environment Ministry show Germany released the equivalent of 868.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, 38 million less than 2017.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Germany benefited from 2018\'s warm and sunny weather, which increased production of renewable energy and reduced the need for heating fuel.
Germany\'s emissions last year were about 30.6 percent lower than in 1990. The country aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent from that baseline year by 2030 as part of efforts to curb climate change.
Cabinet is debating a bill that could set legally binding emissions goals for each sector of the economy.

MILAN (AP) - A mayoral candidate in Italy says a cousin of hers was threatened on a public tram in Florence because of the color of his skin.
Antonella Bundu, who was born in Florence to parents from Sierra Leone, said in a Facebook post on Monday that "a fascist gang" accosted her cousin with both racial insults and death threats.
Bundu says other passengers in the rail car came to his defense.
She wrote the experience shook up her cousin "because if a fascist gang felt they could act in broad daylight, in public, that means that something isn\'t right, and that this climate of hatred must be stopped before it is too late."
The current mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, says police are reviewing video footage to try to identify the aggressors.


MELBOURNE, April 5 (Reuters) - England coach Eddie Jones has ruled himself out of replacing Australia boss Michael Cheika after the Rugby World Cup, saying the Wallabies need a "generational change" in culture, local media reported on Friday.
Jones, who guided the Wallabies to the 2003 World Cup final before his acrimonious departure two years later, is reported to be on Rugby Australia\'s (RA) short-list of candidates.
Cheika has said he would quit if Australia failed to win the Sept. 20-Nov. 2 World Cup in Japan.
"I am happy in Europe," Jones told the Sydney Morning Herald.
"The Wallabies need a generational change in culture."
Australia, ranked sixth in the world, won only four of 13 tests in 2018, their worst season in decades.
Jones is contracted to England until 2021 but his deal features a break clause if the team flops in Japan.
Jones\'s comments come two weeks after New Zealander Dave Rennie said he was unlikely to take over the Australia job while contracted to Glasgow Warriors until 2020.
New Zealander Warren Gatland, the Wales and British and Irish Lions coach, has also been reported to be on RA\'s short-list.
Gatland is leaving Wales after the World Cup and has also been linked with taking over at defending champions New Zealand once Steve Hansen leaves the role after Japan.

Aboriginal elder Gudju Gudju Fourmile (C) of the Yidinji people received the skeletal remains at Munich\'s Five Continents museum
A German museum handed over the remains of an Aboriginal ancestral king to Australia Tuesday in the first of three such ceremonies across Germany this month in what Canberra called a record return.
The Australian ambassador to Germany, Lynette Wood, and elder Gudju Gudju Fourmile of the Yidinji people received the skeletal remains at Munich\'s Five Continents museum. They had been in German possession since 1889.
Skulls and bones from Australia\'s native peoples were removed by scientists in the late 19th and early 20th century and taken to museums, universities and collections in Australia and around the world.
There they were subjected to "research" purporting to explain human biological variety.
In a statement, Australia\'s Minister for Communications and the Arts Mitch Fifield welcomed the planned repatriation of a total of 53 Australian indigenous remains from Germany in April, saying it would be "the largest number of ancestors returned from Germany to date".
A further ceremony is planned at Stuttgart\'s Linden Museum on Friday for the repatriation of eight Aborigine remains.
"These ancestors will be returned to Australia under Australian government stewardship, so they can be cared for closer to home while further work is undertaken to identify their communities of origin," Fifield said.
On Monday in Berlin, 37 ancestors\' remains from the Saxony state ethnographic collections as well as five ancestors from Martin Luther University will be returned to Yawuru community representatives and the Australian government.
"The Government would like to thank the German state governments and the collecting institutions for their commitment to recognising the significance of repatriation for all Australians, which contributes to healing and reconciliation," Fifield said.
Bavaria\'s arts and sciences minister Bernd Sibler, who attended Tuesday\'s event, said the state was committed to a "transparent approach to collections from the colonial era", in coordination with indigenous representatives.
Australia\'s Department of Communication and the Arts said it had supported the "unconditional" return of more than 1,500 Australian indigenous ancestral remains from overseas and private collections for more than 30 years.
It said it was in talks with 35 institutions across 10 countries on the return of further ancestral remains.
Germany has until now returned 51 human remains to Australia.
The native Aboriginal population, who have occupied Australia for 50,000 years, were dispossessed of their lands by the arrival of settlers two centuries ago.
As the colonisers pushed into the vast interior of the island continent, they were resisted by the local population and thousands of men, women and children were killed.


BERLIN (AP) - Germany\'s Foreign Ministry has protested Brunei\'s plans to implement Islamic criminal laws that punishes gay sex by stoning offenders to death.
In a statement Tuesday, the ministry said German diplomats expressed concern at the introduction of Sharia law penalties and appealed to Brunei\'s ambassador Monday to "abide by existing international human rights obligations."
The legal change in the tiny, oil-rich monarchy, which also includes amputation for theft, is due to come into force Wednesday.
Human rights group Amnesty International has slammed the punishments as "vicious ."
American actor George Clooney, who is married to prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, called recently for a boycott of luxury hotels in Europe and the United States linked to Brunei\'s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.

BERLIN, April 10 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday he would urge financial leaders during meetings in Washington later this week to aim for a minimum level of corporate taxation globally.
"For me, a very important topic for the IMF meeting is the fight for a fair taxation," Scholz said ahead of the April 12-14 International Monetary Fund and World Bank Spring Meetings.
"We want to prevent large, global corporations from escaping their responsibility to pay taxes," Scholz said.
Financial leaders meeting in Washington will discuss at various levels proposals to introduce a minimum level of corporate taxation. "The ambitious goal is to reach an international agreement by the summer of next year," he said.
The German finance minister said he did not expect the meetings in Washington to discuss foreign exchange rate manipulation, or Germany\'s large current account surplus.
However, Scholz said Germany would use parts of its budget surplus to boost fiscal stimulus and support corporate research and development with incentives worth 1.25 billion euros ($1.41 billion) annually, without a time limit.

MILAN, April 12 (Reuters) - Italian payments group Nexi has priced what is set to be one of Europe\'s biggest initial public offerings this year at 9 euros per share, valuing the group\'s equity at 5.7 billion euros ($6.4 billion).
The price, which confirmed what sources told Reuters on Thursday, was at the bottom of a price range that had narrowed to between 9.0 euros and 9.5 euros.
Nexi said in a statement on Friday the deal valued the company at 7.3 billion euros including debt, the equivalent of 17.2 times its core earnings. That is roughly in line with average industry valuations, according to one analyst\'s report.
It plans to float 35.6 percent of the company on the market, rising to 40.9 percent if an overallotment option is exercised.
Nexi, which runs electronic payments for credit card operator CartaSi, was taken over by private equity funds Bain Capital, Advent International and Clessidra at the end of 2015.
The fast-growing payments business faces competition from newcomers tapping technologies for alternative payment methods. In Italy, only 14 percent of purchases are cashless compared with more than half in the Netherlands, according to data from research house Ambrosetti.
The IPO will raise total proceeds of about 2 billion euros before the overallotment, including 684 million euros in fresh capital which is to be used to cut and refinance Nexi\'s debt.
The offer drew 5.4 billion euros in demand from more than 340 investors across the world, Nexi said.
Nexi shares are due to start trading in Milan on Tuesday.
BofA Merrill Lynch, Banca IMI, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Mediobanca acted as joint global coordinators and bookrunners in the deal.

Cannabis being sold on the streets of Europe may be contaminated with faeces, scientists have discovered.
Samples sold in Madrid were tested and found E.coli bacteria in three quarters\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x93 the diarrhoea and vomiting bug can be transmitted through human faeces.
Most of the samples were too dangerous to be consumed and pose a \'public health risk\', the researchers said.
Though the study was only conducted in Spain, one expert told MailOnline the same \'unusual\' thing could be happening in the UK and other places in Europe.
This is because of the way the drug is sometimes smuggled into countries \xe2\x80\x93 by swallowing it and later excreting it with the use of laxatives.
Experts said the findings are worrying considering some people who use cannabis do so to try and alleviate health problems.\xc2\xa0
Tonnes of cannabis being sold on the streets of Europe may be contaminated with faeces, scientists in Madrid have discovered
The research team, led by Jos\xc3\xa9 Manuel Moreno P\xc3\xa9rez, a pharmacologist from the Universidad Complutense in Madrid, collected 90 samples in Madrid over a year.
The samples were separated into either \'acorns\' or \'ingots\', which are the shapes they are bought in.
Each sample was then broken down into smaller pieces and looked at under a microscope, the authors write in the journal Forensic Science International.\xc2\xa0
They found that 93 per cent of the acorn-shaped samples were contaminated with E.coli, as well as 29.4 per cent of the ingot samples.
Some 10 per cent of the cannabis samples were also contaminated with Aspergillus, a dangerous fungus that can cause serious health problems such as lung infections.
A total of 88.3 per cent of the cannabis samples were not suitable for consumption based on the amount of E.coli contamination allowed by guidelines in the EU and US.
The odour of each sample was also recorded and 40 per cent of acorns had an aroma of faeces, the researchers said. All of these were contaminated with E.coli.
The research team, led by Jos\xc3\xa9 Manuel Moreno P\xc3\xa9rez, a pharmacologist from the Universidad Complutense in Madrid, looked at 90 samples under a microscope. Pictured, an acorn shape
This led the researchers to suggest the way the cannabis is transported into the country \xe2\x80\x93 where it is illegal \xe2\x80\x93 may be to blame.
Mr\xc2\xa0P\xc3\xa9rez told Spanish newspaper El Pa\xc3\xads the cannabis is wrapped up in small plastic pellets and swallowed before the drug smugglers then \'take a laxative and expel\' them in a toilet.
WHAT IS E. COLI?\xc2\xa0 E.coli \xe2\x80\x93 full name\xc2\xa0Escherichia coli \xe2\x80\x93 is a bacteria commonly found in people\'s bodies and which usually does not cause any illness. However, it can cause infection in the gut or urinary tract infections (UTIs) which can have unpleasant symptoms. Diarrhoea, abdominal pain and fever are all common effects, while more serious cases of the infection can cause bloody diarrhoea, dehydration or kidney failure. Advice for avoiding E. coli infection includes good\xc2\xa0hand-washing,\xc2\xa0washing fruits and vegetables, cooking meat thoroughly and keeping raw meat separate from other food, and not swallowing water when swimming. E. coli can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a rare disease of the blood which can lead to potentially deadly kidney failure.\xc2\xa0
The acorns are then sold by dealers to unknowing users who, the authors pointed out, may believe contamination cannot cause harm if it is inhaled.\xc2\xa0
Ian Hamilton, a lecturer in mental health and addiction at the University of York, told MailOnline the findings were \'very unusual\' because this is the sort of thing you would associate with the smuggling of a drug like cocaine.
He said: \'This highlights just how much you don\'t know what you will be exposed to. The same thing could happen in the UK as has happened in Madrid.\'
However, he said the contamination of E.coli could have been from the hands of the people who processed the drugs.
He added the results are particularly concerning for those with existing health conditions who use cannabis.
\'We know that some people who have problems with their health use cannabis to try and alleviate the problems they have. This group will be particularly vulnerable to this type of contamination which could make their underlying health problem much worse.
\'The risk of exposure to these type of bacteria is always there in an illegal market where some dealers and suppliers don\'t have to adhere to any quality control.\'
People with weakened immune systems or lung diseases, such as asthma or cystic fibrosis, are at a higher risk of developing health problems due to Aspergillus fungus.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
The findings, the authors said, are similar to that of a study which analysed samples of cannabis sold in coffee shops in the Netherlands, which also found that 80 per cent were contaminated with E.coli.\xc2\xa0


BERLIN (AP) - Germany\'s environment minister says the government will discuss introducing a carbon tax as part of its national plan to curb climate change.
Speaking after the first meeting of a special "climate Cabinet," German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Wednesday that government ministers would, over the coming months, put forward proposals for cutting greenhouse gases in the areas they oversee.
Germany\'s transport ministry opposes sector-specific targets, but Schulze insisted "everyone will have to shoulder some of the responsibility."
She also displayed openness to some kind of carbon tax. Other countries have already introduced carbon pricing to discourage the burning of fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases and stoke global warming.
Schulze said of such carbon taxes that "there are many different models that will also be debated in Cabinet."

MILAN (AP) - The Latest on migrants and asylum-seekers in Europe (all times local):
1:25 p.m.
Germany says it has asked the European Commission to find a safe port for a German humanitarian group\'s boat carrying 64 rescued migrants. Berlin says it is willing to take some of them in but expects European partners to do so as well.
The group, Sea-Eye, asked Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a port for the migrants on the Alan Kurdi ship. Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers.
German Interior Ministry spokesman Stefan Ruwwe-Gloesenkamp said Berlin has asked the European Union\'s executive Commission to coordinate the search for a safe port. He said Germany trusts that "a large number of member states" will be prepared to take in migrants and Berlin is ready to do "its part."

1:20 p.m.
Protesting migrants in Greece have blocked Athens\' main train station and disrupted rail services, apparently prompted by false reports on social media that restrictions on travel to northern Europe had been lifted.
Police said about 300 protesters gathered Friday at Larissis Station near central Athens, with many sitting on the tracks in front of trains.
Authorities did not immediately intervene to disperse the demonstrators, while officials from the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, were trying to persuade them to leave voluntarily.
The protest occurred a day after clashes broke out near a camp for refugees and migrants in northern Greece, after protesters tried to break through a police cordon and reach the border with North Macedonia, which has been fenced off and heavily policed for the past three years.

11:40 a.m.
The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says it is asking Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a safe port for the 64 migrants it rescued off Libya earlier this week.
Sea-Watch spokesman Carlotta Weibl said Friday that the rescue boat Alan Kurdi remains in international waters off Lampedusa and will not approach Italy\'s southernmost island until it has permission.
She said conditions on board were worsening and that a storm was approaching. She said a request has been made to the German foreign ministry to find a solution.
Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers to pack unseaworthy rubber dinghies with migrants looking for sanctuary in Europe.

LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - Germany\'s benchmark 10-year bond yield was around zero percent on Thursday, as more signs of weakness in Europe\'s biggest economy offset optimism about U.S.-China trade talks and a softer Brexit.
After notching up the biggest monthly declines in almost three years in March, German Bund yields rose at the start of April as global economic data improved and discussions between the world\'s two biggest economies on trade appeared to be making headway. Thursday saw a note of caution return.
German industrial orders fell unexpectedly in February, registering their biggest drop in more than two years, data showed.
That followed news that leading German economic institutes have lowered their 2019 growth forecast to 0.8 percent from 1.9 percent previously.
Germany\'s 10-year Bund yield was trading around zero percent , flat on the day. It jumped five basis points the day before in its biggest one-day rise since mid-January.
"We had argued that negative 10-year Bund yields could only be rationalised by extreme angst," said Benjamin Schroeder, ING\'s senior rates strategist. "Some of that angst has been lifted over the course of the past few days by a slew of positive headlines leaving the 10-year Bund yield around zero again."
In addition to optimism about U.S.-China trade negotiations, hopes of a softer British exit from the European Union have weakened the appeal of safe-haven assets.
The lower house of the British parliament on Wednesday approved legislation which would force Prime Minister Theresa May to seek a Brexit delay to prevent a disorderly departure on April 12 without a deal.
"Markets are reacting more to the more positive news on Brexit, and if we do see some conclusion here that would be bearish for bond yields," said Pooja Kumra, European rates strategist at TD Securities in London. "But we are in mixed ground because we have poor data and the focus on Brexit."
There was also some focus on the release later of the minutes from the European Central Bank\'s March meeting -- especially for details on the ECB\'s plans to issue new cheap loans to banks and a debate about tiering interest rates.
Most euro zone bond yields were little changed. Greek 10-year bond yields touched a one-month low at 3.646 percent amid optimism about a new bond sale in coming months and talk of an International Monetary Fund loan repayment. (Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe, editing by Larry King)

ROME, April 3 (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Wednesday ruled out that Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, who is under fire from within the ruling coalition, could step down.
Tria, a 70-year-old academic who is not a member of either of the ruling parties - the right-wing League and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement - has often struggled to get along with his political backers.
"All ministers should stay calm ... there is nothing on the agenda," Conte said during a visit to Qatar when asked about rumours that Tria could quit.
Simmering tensions erupted this week over what 5-Star sees as Tria\'s reluctance to approve a decree to reimburse savers who suffered losses in a series of bank collapses.
The government has set aside 1.5 billion euros ($1.68 billion) for the reimbursement, which was among 5-Star\'s campaign promises ahead of last year\'s election. Tria fears it will fall foul of European Union rules governing bank rescues.
He has drawn up a compromise proposal which would automatically reimburse less-affluent savers, and set up a special commission to judge the claims of better-off investors.
However, this has not satisfied 5-Star, which is struggling in opinion polls and fears it will be accused of reneging on a core election promise.
"Tria can\'t decide this on his own. We will have savers on the streets," a senior 5-Star lawmaker who asked not to be named told Reuters.
A source close to Tria said the minister had already got the European Commission to informally sign off on his plan, and "if 5-Star upset everything there will be no reimbursements and it will be the poorest savers who suffer".
Tria himself dismissed speculation he was ready to resign as "rubbish", in comments to daily Corriere della Sera on Wednesday. "If I were to go, we\'d have to see how markets would react," he was quoted as saying.
Tria has repeatedly clashed with the ruling parties since the government was formed last June, especially during a drawn-out tussle over Rome\'s 2019 budget when he wanted to commit to a lower deficit than they did.
The League is taking a back seat in the latest hostilities but this could change if they escalate, because it will be reluctant to allow 5-Star to be seen as the main champion of savers\' rights.
The League has overtaken 5-Star as Italy\'s most popular party, according to opinion polls, with both campaigning hard ahead of European parliamentary elections next month.
"Tria\'s position is not in question at the moment, but anything can happen after the European vote," a senior League lawmaker told Reuters. ($1 = 0.8906 euros) (Additional reporting by Francesca Piscioneri, editing by Agnieszka Flak, Editing by William Maclean)


British passports without the words European Union on the front cover have been issued despite the Brexit delay.
The burgundy passports were introduced from March 30, the day after Britain was expected to leave the EU.
Some passports including the words European Union will continue to be issued while the remaining stock is used up.
But those applying for a new travel document will not be able to choose between the two.
Susan Hindle Barone, who picked up her new passport on Friday, said on Twitter she was \xe2\x80\x9ctruly appalled\xe2\x80\x9d.
TRULY APPALLED. Picked up my new passport today - my old one expires in the next couple of months. See below: Spot the difference! pic.twitter.com/R7BW9lk6I5 \xe2\x80\x94 Susan Hindle Barone (@SpinHBarone) April 5, 2019
\xe2\x80\x9cI was just surprised \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99re still members of the EU,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 she told the Press Association.
Photo from the twitter feed of SpinHBarone of her new passport (left) and her old passport (right) (@SpinHBarone/Twitter/PA)
\xe2\x80\x9cI was surprised they\xe2\x80\x99ve made the change when we haven\xe2\x80\x99t left, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a tangible mark of something which I believe to be completely futile.
\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we gain by leaving? There\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a whole lot we lose.\xe2\x80\x9d
She added: \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s face it, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the changes to the passport \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s just symbolic.
\xe2\x80\x9cWhat really matters are the potential changes to our country \xe2\x80\x93 the damage to the economy, our communities and our international standing.\xe2\x80\x9d
The decision to remove the words was made in anticipation of Britain leaving the EU at the end of last month.
Dark blue passports are scheduled to be issued from the end of this year.
A Home Office spokeswoman said: \xe2\x80\x9cBurgundy passports that no longer include the words European Union on the front cover were introduced from 30 March 2019.
\xe2\x80\x9cIn order to use leftover stock and achieve best value to the taxpayer, passports that include the words European Union will continue to be issued for a short period after this date.
\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be no difference for British citizens whether they are using a passport that includes the words European Union, or a passport that does not. Both designs will be equally valid for travel.\xe2\x80\x9d


Marco Reus has revealed Mesut Ozil is the best player he has ever lined up alongside for Germany.
The pair played together at international level for seven years before the Arsenal playmaker retired last summer.\xc2\xa0
Ozil has started the club\'s last four matches after previously flitting in and out of Unai Emery\'s side this season.
Marco Reus (R) revealed Mesut Ozil is the best player he has lined up alongside for Germany
The 30-year-old was praised by his manager following the Gunners\' win over Newcastle on Monday night and now Reus has also hailed him.
The Borussia Dortmund forward was asked \'who is the best national team player you\'ve played with?\'
\'Mesut Ozil,\' he told Copa 90.\xc2\xa0\'The way he creates goals... he\'s a player with a really good eye for his team-mates.
Ozil has started Arsenal\'s last four matches after previously flitting in and out of the side
\'He has so many assists in the Premier League and with the national team.
\'He\'s just an intelligent player and you can see that right away with a first glance. I always enjoyed playing with him and that\'s why it\'s a pity he\'s taken a step back.
\'I hope he\'ll get back to form and return to playing regularly for Arsenal.\'
Arsenal have leapfrogged Tottenham into third place in the Premier League table as they look to secure a Champions League qualification spot.


The Conservative Party finally admitted tonight it will be taking part in European Parliament elections on May 23 almost three years after the Brexit vote.
In a fresh humiliation for Theresa May, her party started recruitment for candidates tonight ahead of the official calling of the elections tomorrow.
Mrs May has insisted for months she did not want Britain to take part in the EU elections and as recently as last week said she wanted to avoid it.\xc2\xa0
In her letter to EU Council President Donald Tusk on Friday, she asked for a fresh delay to Brexit that could be cut short if the deal passes in time to avoid the election.\xc2\xa0
But an email to every member of the Tory candidates list tonight said: \'Due to the current situation we will be contesting the European Elections on 23 May 2019 and the closing date for nominations is 24 April.\'
The EU has insisted Britain elect new MEPs if it wants to delay Brexit by extending Article 50 - warning the UK cannot stay in the bloc for longer without them.
Running the national election will cost the taxpayer at least \xc2\xa3100million and force political parties to spend millions more on campaign materials.\xc2\xa0
In a fresh humiliation for Theresa May, her party started recruitment for candidates tonight ahead of the official calling of the elections tomorrow
The Conservative Party finally admitted it will be taking part in European Parliament elections on May 23 almost three years after the Brexit vote
The move will enrage Brexiteers already furious with the Prime Minister\'s handling of the Leave vote.
Sources in the hardline European Research Group told MailOnline: \'It\'s good to know that Theresa May can say bad things with certainty.
\'If it\'s set to destroy the party, she\'s firm of purpose and pushes on. Corbyn and Barnier are very, very lucky to have her.\'\xc2\xa0
Tory MP Bob Seely said: \'Wish this was a week-late April foo wind-up. If true, let\'s hope we pull out beforehand.
\'This is really going to wind-up our voters, and not surprisingly.\'\xc2\xa0
David Lidington, Mrs May\'s deputy, has formally triggered the process of the elections tonight.
He laid an order in Parliament that will allow returning officers across the country to start the countdown to polling day, which runs on a strict timetable.\xc2\xa0
Running a national election costs around \xc2\xa3100million. Britain currently has 73 members of the European Parliament following the 2014 election, which Ukip won.
A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said:\xc2\xa0\'It remains the Government\'s intention to leave the EU with a deal and pass the necessary legislation before 22 May, so that we do not need to participate in European Parliamentary elections.
\'As a responsible Government today we have taken the necessary steps required by law should we have to participate.
\'The Day of Poll Order provides Returning Officers with a date to hold potential European Parliamentary elections, but it does not make these elections inevitable as leaving the EU before the date of election automatically removes our obligation to take part.\'

In other developments today, Jeremy Corbyn slammed Theresa May\'s refusal to budge off her red lines tonight after the Prime Minister met Brexiteer ministers and top Tory MPs in Downing Street.
After meeting with his shadow cabinet about the state of the cross-party talks, the Labour leader said he was \'frustrated\' the Prime Minister\'s actions were not matching her calls for compromise.\xc2\xa0
Mrs May has enraged her own side by inviting Mr Corbyn to talks on finding a compromise that can get her Brexit deal through Parliament.\xc2\xa0Downing Street and Labour have agreed to more talks between officials tonight.
There are persistent rumours in Westminster Mrs May is poised to over Labour a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit - despite the the threat of resignations from the Brexiteer wing of her Cabinet if she effectively rules out hopes of new trade deals after Brexit.
But the concession could be the only way to get Labour behind her deal. Mr Corbyn has long demanded a permanent customs union be the basis of the final UK-EU trade deal.
Labour insists it would negotiate a \'UK say\' on new EU trade deals once Britain has left the bloc but even if achieved this falls far short of the Leave vision of Britain as a major free trade player on the global stage.
Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench Tory 1922 Committee said there was not \'at the moment\' a deal as he left Downing Street this afternoon.

Earlier,\xc2\xa0Mrs May met Brexiteer ministers including Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, Aid Secretary Penny Mordaunt, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Trade Secretary Liam Fox and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling earlier.
She held further talks with Remainer ministers including Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd and Justice Secretary David Gauke later.
The meetings come amid claims by the Telegraph that Mrs May\'s deputy David Lidington is poised to make a written offer to Labour. Talks are ongoing about what it should say on a customs union and new public vote.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Mrs May has cancelled tomorrow\'s full-blown Cabinet so she can travel to Paris and Berlin for talks on delaying Brexit ahead of an EU summit on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 There are mounting fears French President Emmanuel Macron could use the summit to trash what is left of Mrs May\'s plans for a prompt Brexit.
Ahead of No 10 talks, hardline Brexiteers launched a new bid to oust Mrs May as Tory MP Mark Francois publicly demanded a new vote on her leadership.\xc2\xa0
Unless Mrs May secures a delay to Brexit at the EU summit on Wednesday, Britain will leave without a deal at 11pm on Friday.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Earlier, Mrs May met Brexiteer ministers including Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, Aid Secretary Penny Mordaunt, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Trade Secretary Liam Fox and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling earlier.\xc2\xa0
Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Aid Secretary Penny Mordaunt arrived for the meeting of senior minsters today\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
A raft of ministers have threatened to quit the Government if Mrs May pivots to a soft Brexit to salvage her deal, which has been trounced three times by MPs.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WITH BREXIT? MONDAY APRIL 8: LABOUR WAIT FOR BREXIT DEAL OFFER Theresa May paved the way for a customs union deal with Labour last night as she pledged to \xe2\x80\x98compromise\xe2\x80\x99 to ensure Brexit happens. Ministers were out in force today repeating this message but Labour said they are waiting for an offer from the PM so talks can move forward. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said \'the ball is in the Government\'s court\'.\xc2\xa0 TUESDAY APRIL 9: PM\'S EUROPEAN TOUR\xc2\xa0 The Prime Minister will fly meet Angela Merkel in Berlin and then on to Paris to see Emmanuel Macron as she tried to convince European leaders to back her plea to extend Article 50 until June 30. Donald Tusk says EU leaders should demand a delay until March 31, 2020 - but Mr Macron is said to be considering forcing the UK out of the EU unless they face \'strict\' conditions.\xc2\xa0 WEDNESDAY APRIL 10: EU SUMMIT Another summit with EU leaders \xe2\x80\x93 where May will ask for a new delay beyond April 12.\xc2\xa0 May\'s new plan is to strike a cross-party consensus in London and persuade EU leaders it means the deal can be delivered in time for Brexit on May 22. She may have to accept a longer extension that means holding EU elections, as Brussels has made clear this is a red line - and will take a decision on delay without Britain and it must be unanimous.\xc2\xa0 EU officials including Michel Barnier have warned that the risk of an accidental No Deal is increasing if May arrives with no plan. FRIDAY APRIL 12: BREXIT DAY Britain is due to leave the EU without a deal on this date if no delay is agreed.\xc2\xa0
But if Mrs May does not move to Labour she faces even more resignations from the Remain wing over the threat of No Deal.
Instead of Cabinet tomorrow, Mrs\xc2\xa0May will hold a showdown with Emmanuel Macron in Paris as the French President considers his own \'de Gaulle moment\' with Brexit and could force Britain out of the EU.
Mr Macron is urging the EU to turn the screw on Britain by demanding \'strict\' conditions if Article 50 is extended at a Brussels summit on Wednesday or demand No Deal.
The Prime Minister will also jet to Berlin tomorrow for emergency talks with Angela Merkel - and will be calling some of the other 27 EU leaders in the next 24 hours - as soft Brexit talks with Labour hang in the balance.
She will meet the German Chancellor before the French President ahead of the EU summit in Brussels on Wednesday where she will beg them to delay Brexit until June 30.
But with the EU pushing for a 12-month extension, the PM may ask the two leaders to push her request for a shorter delay as she faces mass ministerial resignations if Brexit is stopped until March 31, 2020.
Mr Macron wants the UK to commit to not to disrupt the EU\'s business after Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chairman of the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, said Britain should be \'as difficult as possible\' in the event of a long extension and frustrate EU budget decisions.
If not he could choose to say \'non\' to Mrs May, as General Charles de Gaulle of France did twice when he vetoed Britain\'s bid to join the EEC in the 1960s.
The EU\'s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is flying to Dublin for emergency talks with Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar amid fears Britain could end up with No Deal.
To avert this Mrs May, who will cancel a crunch cabinet meeting because of her German visit, is risking civil war with her own party by pursuing a softer Brexit, with Boris Johnson calling it a \'surrender\' and warning his party leader: \'It cannot, must not and will not happen\'.\xc2\xa0

Scotland\xe2\x80\x99s Brexit Secretary has insisted holding European elections is essential for the UK, as he warned staging a second referendum could take up to eight months to organise.
Mike Russell stressed the need for UK\xc2\xa0ministers to seek a \xe2\x80\x9cvery long extension\xe2\x80\x9d to the Brexit process.
As it stands, the UK is due to leave the EU on April 12, with no deal yet in place.
Prime Minister Theresa May is meeting Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for a second round of talks in a bid to resolve the impasse which has resulted from the Commons\xe2\x80\x99 repeated rejection of her Withdrawal Agreement.
But for progress to be achieved, Mr Russell said the PM would have to \xe2\x80\x9cmove from the bunker\xe2\x80\x9d and accept some form of compromise.
Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland\xe2\x80\x99s Good Morning Scotland programme on Thursday, Mr Russell said: \xe2\x80\x9cJeremy Corbyn said last night he was surprised that the Prime Minister hadn\xe2\x80\x99t given more, I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised. I think anybody with experience of the Prime Minister knows that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give, she just sits there and takes.
\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the big issue, is she prepared to move from the bunker in which she has established herself over many months and move forward?
\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no signs that she is, but equally those discussions will have to continue.
\xe2\x80\x9cShe has kept the clock ticking in a very dangerous way. This is her responsibility.
\xe2\x80\x9cSo there is a responsibility to try to find some way forward before the cliff-edge of a no-deal Brexit which is now essentially a week away.\xe2\x80\x9d
With the UK\xe2\x80\x99s exit date \xe2\x80\x93 which has already been delayed from the original March 29 deadline \xe2\x80\x93 looming, Mr Russell revealed he had written to Mrs May\xe2\x80\x99s defacto deputy, David Lidington, to argue the case for the UK taking part in May\xe2\x80\x99s European Parliament elections.
He said: \xe2\x80\x9cYesterday I wrote to David Lidington to say I thought those elections were now essential and have to be held.\xe2\x80\x9d
Prime Minister Theresa May has been holding talks with Labour aimed at finding a way forward on Brexit (PA)
Mr Russell argued that \xe2\x80\x9cany solution\xe2\x80\x9d to the Brexit impasse had to have a People\xe2\x80\x99s Vote \xe2\x80\x9cat the heart of it\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 noting that politicians at Westminster had failed to resolve matters.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe people have to be asked what they think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.
But he stressed \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t rush a referenda\xe2\x80\x9d, insisting best practice would have to be followed for such a vote.
He said: \xe2\x80\x9cClearly this is a matter of six to eight months, I would have thought, that also implies a very long delay and sensible people are arguing for that very long delay and for European elections.\xe2\x80\x9d
That could have knock-on implications for a possible second Scottish independence referendum \xe2\x80\x93 with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon set to make clear her thinking on this only when there is more clarity over Brexit.
Mr Russell accepted: \xe2\x80\x9cQuite clearly clarity on the Brexit process is required.\xe2\x80\x9d
But he also said: \xe2\x80\x9cEqually I have to say that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the people of Scotland should have to suffer the chaos and confusion and economic and other destruction that is taking place at the present moment.\xe2\x80\x9d


April 11 (Reuters) - Italy top insurer Generali will invest 1 billion euros ($1.13 billion) in the first fund of a new asset manager, the company said on Thursday.
Europe\'s No 3 insurer will hold a majority stake of ThreeSixty Investments in partnership with a team of professionals led by Giordano Lombardo, former CEO of Pioneer Investments.
The news was earlier reported by Italian financial newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore.
Last month, the insurer said it was ready to look around for growth opportunities in Europe, Asia and the United States, and added that it was well-positioned to achieve the targets it set in November for the years until 2021.
Generali has earmarked up to 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) for acquisitions and growth as it looks to asset management and other higher margin businesses to fuel earnings.

BERLIN (AP) - German government statistics show crime dropped in the country last year, including violent offenses.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said as he presented an annual crime report on Tuesday that "every crime is one too many, but objectively, this is the lowest level in decades."
Police agencies recorded more than 5.6 million cases in 2018, 3.6 percent fewer than in 2017. They included 185,377 violent crimes, a 1.9 percent decrease from the year before.
Despite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.
The overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent. The clearance rate for solved murder and manslaughter cases was 96.1%.

April 3 (Reuters) - European shares touched a near eight-month high on Wednesday as investors took heart from possible progress towards a trade deal between Beijing and Washington and encouraging economic data out of China and Europe.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.7 pct by 0945 GMT, hitting its highest level since Aug. 10 in its fourth straight daily rise.
All major bourses rallied and Frankfurt\'s trade-sensitive DAX outperformed, gaining 1.3 percent.
London\'s exporter-heavy FTSE 100 lagged, as the pound strengthened after Prime Minister Theresa May\'s announcement of talks with the opposition Labour party - a signal Britain may end up with softer Brexit.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Tuesday he expects the United States and China "to make more headway" as the two sides resume trade talks this week.
"Markets really grab anything that is positive, with trade being the case today, although we still have to see whether the trade negotiations will lead to a positive and stable outcome," said Elwin de Groot, head of macro strategy at Rabobank.
Chipmakers Ams, Siltronic and Infineon Technologies got a boost from hopes of a trade deal, echoing gains in U.S. and Japanese semiconductor stocks.
The STOXX 600 has rallied more than 2 percent in the last three sessions as the two sides reported progress in trade talks and strong factory data out of China and the United States eased nerves about slowing global growth.
Data on Wednesday was also encouraging as the latest private business survey showed activity in China\'s services sector had picked up to a 14-month high in March.
EVIDENCE OF STABILISATION
Adding to the upbeat mood, final euro zone composite PMI figures indicated lethargic business activity last month, but was higher than an earlier flash reading.
"Better-than-expected PMIs from China set the tone for the equity markets and this morning\'s better PMIs from several European states are adding to the evidence that things are stabilising," said de Groot.
Most European sectors were higher as the basic resources sector extended a six-day winning streak and auto stocks touched a near seven-month peak.

\xe2\x80\x9cWe do get times where everyone comes in together, with 20 or 30 people in the queue,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth said.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve found that the person on the till is quite stressed trying to sort out change, so they\xe2\x80\x99re not really engaging or explaining different cakes that we have because they\xe2\x80\x99re under pressure to get down the line.
\xe2\x80\x9cWith contactless, the customer just taps their card, so they can spend more time talking to staff or explaining what they want, and everything can be done really efficiently.\xe2\x80\x9d
Bear Market partnered with Magnet Networks,\xc2\xa0a telecommunications and data connectivity provider, to include a pre-order app and WiFi.

LONDON (AP) - With the completion of their domestic title defenses seeming a formality, Barcelona and Juventus can now focus on the Champions League.
For the rest of the quarterfinalists it\'s a far more challenging period that will stretch their squads while ambitions at home and abroad are juggled.
Here is a look at this week\'s first legs:
TOTTENHAM-MANCHESTER CITY
Just like last season, Manchester City comes up against a Premier League rival in the quarterfinals.
Different this time is not only the opponent - Tottenham rather than Liverpool - but also the surroundings. City will be Tottenham\'s second opponents in its new 62,000-capacity stadium in north London on Tuesday.

"I don\'t care about the stadium," City playmaker Kevin De Bruyne said. "I care about the team we play. Everybody talks about the stadium like it\'s something special. Everybody has a stadium. Everybody has supporters."
If De Bruyne sounds irritated it\'s not because of the state of City\'s campaign. Pep Guardiola\'s team remains in a quadruple chase after reaching the FA Cup final with a victory over Brighton on Saturday, having already won the League Cup and sitting second in the Premier League.
The Champions League is the one major honor to elude City in the 11 years since Abu Dhabi investment transformed the club. City hasn\'t even reached a final, falling at this stage last year to Liverpool, but is the competition\'s top scorer this season with 26 goals.
Tottenham is in a scrap just to qualify for a fourth successive season in the Champions League by finishing in the Premier League\'s top four. With a squad lacking reinforcements in the last year due to stadium building costs, Tottenham is third in the league, but only a point ahead of fifth-place Chelsea.
LIVERPOOL-PORTO
While Liverpool will be without banned right back Andy Robertson, Porto has two key players ruled out through suspension: playmaker Hector Herrera and Pepe, the center back who won three Champions League titles with Real Madrid.
Coach Sergio Conceicao will still be able to call on center back Eder Militao, who doesn\'t move to Madrid until next season, but left back Alex Telles remains doubtful due to a hip injury.
Porto, which last reached the quarterfinals four years ago, is chasing its first appearance in the semifinals since winning the Champions League under the then-emerging manager Jose Mourinho in 2004.
Fueled by Mohamed Salah\'s goals, Liverpool made it to last season\'s final, where the five-time European champion was beaten by Real Madrid.
The forward has rediscovered his scoring touch in time for the visit of Porto to Anfield on Tuesday, netting for the first time in nine games in a victory at Southampton on Friday. That took Liverpool to the top of the Premier League ahead of Manchester City.
Porto is being kept off top spot in Portugal by Benfica due to an inferior goal difference.
MANCHESTER UNITED-BARCELONA
The quarterfinals have been the end of Barcelona\'s Champions League journey for three successive seasons since winning a fifth European title in 2015.
United is in the last eight for the first time since 2014 when defeat helped spell the end of David Moyes\' reign as Alex Ferguson\'s immediate successor.
Victory at Paris Saint-Germain last month, though, contributed to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer being handed the United job on a three-year contract after convincing the ownership of his credentials during a three-month audition after Mourinho\'s firing.
United hosts Barcelona at Old Trafford on Wednesday with the luxury of having not played for more than a week since an April 2 loss to Wolverhampton.
"We will have less rest but on the other hand we will be more motivated by the victory over Atletico," Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said.
While Barcelona opened an 11-point Spanish league lead over Atletico with a 2-0 win on Saturday, United is in sixth place in the Premier League - two points off fourth with six games remaining.
AJAX-JUVENTUS
Juventus is hopeful Cristiano Ronaldo will be able to play some part in Wednesday\'s match after injuring a right thigh muscle on Portugal duty last month.
The forward participated in training on Sunday but Juventus will take no risks on the fitness of the hat trick scorer from the last-16 second leg against Atletico Madrid last month.
Moise Kean is ready to step in. The 19-year-old Italy forward has scored five goals in his past five matches for club and country.
While Juventus is one win away from securing a record-extending eighth Serie A title, Ajax is only leading the Eredivisie from PSV Eindhoven on goal difference.
Midfielder Frenkie de Jong, who joins Barcelona next season, was substituted as a precaution during Ajax\'s 4-1 victory over Willem II Tilburg on Saturday after hurting an ankle.
"We want to show Europe what we\'re worth," he said. "I think we\'ve already done that, but we want to confirm it."
Ajax won the Champions League in 1995 and was beaten in the following year\'s final. The Amsterdam club hasn\'t contested the quarterfinals since 2003, when it lost to AC Milan, and had to start in the qualifying rounds in July this season.

PARIS (AP) - Nimes posted a second straight win to get back in the race for a European finish with a 3-1 win over Rennes in a rescheduled French league match on Tuesday.
With seven games left to play, Nimes leapfrogged its Brittany rival into 10th place, just five points behind fifth-place Marseille.
The match at Costieres stadium had been postponed to allow Rennes sufficient time to prepare for a Europa League match it lost to Arsenal last month.
Nimes put on an excellent defensive display and was clinical with its rare chances, as Renaud Ripart, Denis Bouanga and Antonin Bobichon all scored. Nimes defender Herve Lybohy had inadvertently put the teams level in the 40th minute by putting the ball in his own net.
Tempers frayed toward the end of the first half and both teams played with 10 men after the interval as Nimes captain Anthony Briancon was sent off for a foul on Hatem Ben Arfa and his Rennes counterpart Benjamin Andre earned a second yellow card.

Dubrovnik, lately famous for being a \'Game of Thrones\' location, is the backdrop for Chinese efforts to woo eastern Europeans
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang will meet leaders from eastern and central Europe in Croatia on Friday to talk business, fresh from a key summit with EU where he pledged opening up his country\'s economy.
The coastal city of Dubrovnik is hosting the eighth annual "16+1 cooperation" -- an economic platform for Beijing\'s investments in 11 eastern European Union states and five Western Balkan countries.
The grouping has been eyed cautiously in western European capitals as an attempt to "divide and rule" the bloc, a goal Li has denied.
In an article published in Croatian dailies ahead of the gathering, the Chinese premier tried to paint the summit in a cheery light:
"When we put 17 multicolour countries together we get a colour richer than a rainbow," he wrote in the article titled "Multicolour countries, spacious future".
"If we build a rainbow bridge through Asia and Europe, we will achieve a nice future cooperation."
China\'s record on follow-through with investment promises is mixed
Eastern Europe is a core component of Beijing\'s vast "Belt and Road" project, valued at up to $1 trillion and aimed at constructing land and sea links to allow Chinese exports to flow westward.
China has previously announced a $10 billion credit line and $3 billion investment fund for the 16-country region.
So far its record on follow-through is mixed, with some major construction projects under way while other promised investments have been delayed or scrapped.
For instance, building on one of 16+1\'s flag-ship projects -- a railway from Belgrade to Budapest -- has just started in Serbia but is held up by snags in Hungary, ultimately making scant progress five years after it was announced.
- \'Pilot project\' -
This year\'s summit comes just three days after a top EU-China meeting, attended by Li, held as Brussels demands more balanced economic ties with a country it recently labelled as a "systemic rival".
In Brussels on Tuesday the Asian giant pledged to push further to open its economy and deepen ties with the bloc.
EU Council president Donald Tusk hailed Beijing\'s new commitments as a "breakthrough" with both sides committed to globalisation and pursuing international rules.
Brussels and Beijing in a document called for "broader and more facilitated, non-discriminatory market access," in wording the Europeans saw as a Chinese concession.
The EU is increasingly unhappy that markets in Europe are wide open to Chinese companies, while the equivalent is not the case in China.
While the EU\'s 15-trillion-euro ($16.9 trillion) market gives it significant economic clout, the bloc struggles to maintain unity among its 28 members on issues of foreign policy, allowing China to pursue one-on-one deals with individual countries.
EU leaders liked the bit about \'non-discriminatory market access\'
Some EU powers, such as France and Germany, are growing increasingly concerned with China\'s Belt and Road ambitions, especially after populist-led Italy recently became the first G7 member to join the scheme.
In 2018, China was the second largest destination for European exports.
The Chinese trade balance is largely in surplus with the bloc at 184 billion euros, according to Brussels figures.
During the first visit of a Chinese premier to Croatia, Li on Thursday visited the site where a Chinese firm started construction on a 280-million-euro bridge on the Adriatic coast.
It is the first significant Chinese project in Croatia and funded by the EU.
"This bridge is a pilot project for both \'16+1 cooperation\' and cooperation between China and EU," Li said while visiting the bridge\'s site on Thursday.
About 1,000 businessmen including some 400 Chinese will participate at a business forum held alongside the summit in Dubrovnik.


A former Irish soldier who went to live in Islamic State-controlled Syria has reportedly denied fighting for the jihadist militants.
Lisa Smith, a 37-year-old originally from Co Louth, is currently living in a refugee camp in Syria.
In an interview with The Mail On Sunday, she spoke of her desire to return to Ireland with her two-year-old daughter, whom she claims was born to a British father while living in IS territory, a man she says died in the last three months.
\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, I want to go back to my country,\xe2\x80\x9d the former member of the Defence Forces told the newspaper.
\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s (daughter) my number one priority now that\xe2\x80\x99s why I want to leave and take her home with me and get her educated.
\xe2\x80\x9cPeople here are not educated.\xe2\x80\x9d
In the interview with the newspaper, she added: \xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing for me what I can do anyway is just live my life the way I live it, in my own home, with my daughter, and bring my daughter up.
\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to cause problems for anyone, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to mix, I\xe2\x80\x99m still me, I\xe2\x80\x99m still like a good neighbour, I\xe2\x80\x99m still a good friend, I\xe2\x80\x99m just still me.

\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not, like, out to kill anyone, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in suicide attacks.\xe2\x80\x9d
According to the newspaper report, when asked whether she fought for Isis, Ms Smith said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything.\xe2\x80\x9d
She reportedly added: \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t even own a gun.
\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband many times said to me, \xe2\x80\x98you want me to buy you one?\xe2\x80\x99 I said no.
\xe2\x80\x9cHe said \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s just for self-defence\xe2\x80\x99 or, I said: \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\xe2\x80\x99.
\xe2\x80\x9cI think anyone that knows me, you know in the army or outside the army or anywhere in my life, will know that, they know me, that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pick up the weapon and fight and stuff like that.
\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t own a rifle, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t teach them anything.\xe2\x80\x9d
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has already indicated that Ms Smith would be permitted to return to Ireland if she wished.
But he has said a security assessment would have to be carried to make sure she is not a threat to anyone in Ireland.
Asked if she should face investigation in Ireland, Ms Smith told The Mail On Sunday: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I should be tried.
\xe2\x80\x9cIf they want to put an investigation on me, I have nothing to hide.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing I did was come here and, if that\xe2\x80\x99s my crime, like a lot of other people\xe2\x80\x99s, for coming here and realising I made a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d


Sinn Fein is ready to fight European elections in Northern Ireland, its party president has said.
Mary Lou McDonald and other senior party leadership figures discussed the prospect of a poll north of the border at a meeting of the Sinn Fein ruling council in Dublin on Saturday.
\xe2\x80\x9cIf an election happens, we will fight the election. We are ready,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.
\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the uncertainties is around the whole issue of elections in the north, whether or not there will be European elections.
Speaking to media in Dublin with @MaryLouMcDonald After a week of more Brexit chaos, the status quo of uncertainly remains.

Mrs McDonald said a no-deal Brexit remains a \xe2\x80\x9creal and live possibility\xe2\x80\x9d.
She said the democratic mandate of people in Northern Ireland to remain in the EU must be acknowledged.
The Sinn Fein president said commitments made by the UK and EU to protect the Good Friday Agreement and ensure no hardening of the border also have to be honoured.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe look across the water with some despair at the chaos in Westminster,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.

MILAN/ROME, April 2 (Reuters) - The company spearheading the search for partners to rescue airline Alitalia has asked the Italian government to postpone the deadline for binding offers by two months, two sources close to the matter said on Tuesday
Ferrovie dello Stato, the state-owned operator of Italy\'s railways, has been in talks with Delta Air Lines over the rescue of Alitalia but last week said it needed more time to iron out a business plan for Italian flag carrier.
Alitalia was placed under special administration in 2017 after workers rejected the latest in a long line of rescue plans, and Ferrovie has been struggling to find partners ready to inject fresh funds and revamp the airline.
An end of March deadline expired as Ferrovie and its advisers were looking for investors.
"Several potential partners have pulled out ... every option is on the table," one of the sources said.
British budget airline easyJet withdrew from talks last month, with state-controlled Poste Italiane and Leonardo also stating that they are not interested in a deal.
"If the government gives Ferrovie more time it will be a widely agreed political decision to ensure that the solution found is solid and durable, with the best partners for the mission," the second source said.
The special commissioners running Alitalia are due to give their opinion on a postponement soon, but it is up to the industry ministry to take a final decision on a new deadline.
A response by the ministry could arrive in a few days, a third source said.
Last week one of the special commissioners said they could not agree on a deadline that was more than three or four weeks away, warning that the airline could be in danger of falling into liquidation.

LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a session low on Thursday after a report that Italy will slash its growth forecasts prompted fears about a broader economic slump.
Political wrangling over the finances of heavily indebted Italy has seen the euro weaken versus the dollar.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Rome will this month likely cut its 2019 growth estimate to 0.3 percent or 0.4 percent.
The news was circulating for almost a day before the markets appeared to react to a Bloomberg report that said the government is preparing to cut its GDP forecast to 0.1 percent from 1 percent previously.
"The euro stabilized soon after the Italy news triggered an initial move lower... that suggests that the negative sentiment towards the Eurozone may be priced in and that the single currency may have carved out a near-term bottom against the U.S. dollar," said Fawad Razaqzada, a market analyst at Forex.com.
The euro was also pressured on Thursday by more signs of weakness in the German economy.
The euro has remained in a range of $1.12-$1.16 in 2019 despite a slowdown in the euro zone economy prompting new stimulus from the European Central Bank.
The euro was trading at $1.122, flat on the day. It has fallen in six of the previous eight sessions.
Investors were focused on minutes from the ECB\'s March meeting -- especially for details on the ECB\'s plans to issue new cheap loans to banks and a debate about tiering interest rates.
Hopes of a softer British exit from the European Union have weakened the appeal of defensive assets. The safe-haven yen touched a two-week low of 111.575 yen against the dollar late on Wednesday.
The lower house of the British parliament on Wednesday approved legislation that would force Prime Minister Theresa May to seek a Brexit delay to prevent a departure on April 12 without a deal.
The pound last stood at $1.3160, up 0.2 percent on the day.
Positive risk sentiment this week has helped boost the commodity-linked Australian and New Zealand dollars. (Reporting by Tom Finn, editing by Larry King, William Maclean)


The boss of a cupcake company has pre-purchased ten tons of German soft cheese\xc2\xa0over fears that a no-deal Brexit will slow\xc2\xa0deliveries and leave the firm with \'no cheesecakes or decorations\'.
Asher Budwig, managing director of Lola\'s Cupcakes, says the company identified the ingredient as one whose supply might be affected by the UK leaving the European Union as it is imported from Germany.
He told the BBC: \'If ferries can\xe2\x80\x99t come through the port, I mean the factory will literally grind to a halt,
\xe2\x80\x98No cheesecakes, no decorations on cupcakes, you know that\xe2\x80\x99s a massive issue for us and our customers and all the team actually that work here, there\xe2\x80\x99s over two hundred people that work here.\'\xc2\xa0
The boss of Lola\'s Cupcakes (cakes pictured above) ordered some ingredients in advance
Asher Budwig (pictured), managing director of Lola\'s Cupcakes, says the company identified soft cheese as one of the ingredients whose supply might be affected by Brexit disruption as it is imported from Germany
He explained that his firm analysed possible stress factors for the business arising from Brexit and concluded soft cheese, which ordinarily arrives via just-in-time deliveries from the Continent, might be at risk.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Mr Budwig reached out to the UK importer from whom he buys the cheese, and the importer asked the factory for a larger order to ensure supplies.
He said: \'They spoke to the factory in Germany, they produced a lot more - ten times what we would usually go through in a given week - got that all over here to the UK.
\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s being held down in Somerset for us, in a huge chilled distribution facility and then we just call it off as and when we need to, whatever we need we\xe2\x80\x99re asking for.\'
He said that in the current \'political environment\' the firm was now asking itself \'what\'s the next steps?\', adding \'we only purchased ten tonnes\'.\xc2\xa0
Asher Budwig said his team would not be able to make cheesecakes (pictured) if ferries cannot come through\xc2\xa0
It comes as figures revealed the British economy received a boost last month from other companies placing similar larger orders.\xc2\xa0
New statistics reveal Britain\'s gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.3 per cent in the period between December and February compared with the previous quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
In February, the UK economy grew by 0.2% versus January\'s 0.5% print.
Both measures were ahead of economists\' expectations, who had pencilled in zero growth for February and 0.2% for the three-month period.
At that time there were strong fears and warnings that Britain might leave the economic bloc on March 29 without a deal.
This potentially could have led to chaos at the UK border, with badly hit imports and exports, and a shortage of raw materials.
Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, said: \'GDP growth remained modest in the latest three months. Services again drove the economy, with a continued strong performance in IT.
\'Manufacturing also continued to recover after weakness at the end of last year with the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry, chemicals and alcohol performing well in recent months.\'
The ONS cited data that showed a surge in manufacturing output in March was linked to manufacturers and firms hoarding goods in the run-up to what was supposed to be Brexit.
Companies stepped up production to build inventories in advance of March 29, Britain\'s original Brexit day, before the Conservative Government asked the EU for an extension.


BELFAST, April 3 (Reuters) - Northern Ireland\'s Democratic Unionist Party remains a key player in Brexit and is seeking a time limit on the "backstop" insurance mechanism designed to keep the region\'s border with EU-member Ireland open, a senior member said on Wednesday.
Asked if British Prime Minister Theresa May\'s decision on Tuesday to hold talks with the opposition Labour party had frozen it out, DUP member of parliament Jeffrey Donaldson told the BBC that the party was "still in a very strong and influential position" and that events could change quickly.
Donaldson said the DUP\'s 10 members of parliament, who prop up May\'s government, continued to demand changes to her EU withdrawal deal and would need "at the very least a time limit on that backstop" before they would consider supporting it.

LONDON (AP) - The Latest on Brexit (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
\xc2\xa0European Council President Donald Tusk has urged European Union member states to offer the U.K. a flexible extension of up to a year to make sure the nation doesn\'t crash out of the bloc in a chaotic and costly way.\xc2\xa0
Two EU officials, who requested anonymity because they weren\'t authorized to disclose information before it was made public, said that Tusk wants a one-year "Flextention" and get it approved at next Wednesday\'s EU summit.\xc2\xa0
Such a move would mean that the U.K. needs to take part in the May 23-26 European elections, something which British Prime Minister Theresa May has long argued against.\xc2\xa0
May asked Tusk for a short extension until June 30 earlier Friday. Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU on April 12.

9:25 a.m.
Prime Minister Theresa May says Britain will make contingency plans to take part in European Parliament elections in May if no Brexit deal is reached in the interim.
She said in her letter Friday to the EU that she is making these preparations even though she believes it\'s not in Britain\'s interest or the European Union\'s interest for Britain to take part in the elections because it is a departing member state.
May says she "accepts" the EU position that if Britain hasn\'t left the 28-nation bloc by May 23, it will have a legal obligation to take part in the elections.
The prime minister says she is still hopeful of reaching a compromise agreement that could take Britain out of the EU before that time.

9:20 a.m.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is requesting that the deadline for her country to leave the European Union be extended until June 30.
In a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk Friday, May said that "the United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June, 2019."
EU leaders agreed late last month to prolong the Brexit date from March 29 until April 12, unless May could push their mutually agreed divorce deal through Parliament.
The Europeans would prefer that Britain don\'t take part in the May 23-26 EU elections if it is going to leave. April 12 is the last day for Britain to signal whether it will field candidates.


BERLIN (AP) - The German government says greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\'s biggest economy fell 4.2% in 2018, the first major decrease in four years.
Estimates published Tuesday by the Environment Ministry show Germany released the equivalent of 868.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, 38 million less than 2017.
Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said Germany benefited from 2018\'s warm and sunny weather, which increased production of renewable energy and reduced the need for heating fuel.
Germany\'s emissions last year were about 30.6 percent lower than in 1990. The country aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent from that baseline year by 2030 as part of efforts to curb climate change.
Cabinet is debating a bill that could set legally binding emissions goals for each sector of the economy.

Juventus will clinch a record-extending eighth straight Serie A title if it beats AC Milan on Saturday and Napoli loses to Genoa a day later.
Napoli\'s unexpected loss at Empoli on Wednesday will likely have the effect of moving up Juve\'s celebration.
Juventus leads Napoli by 18 points with eight rounds remaining and the Bianconeri hold the tiebreaker, too.
Fourth-place Milan, however, is desperate to end a three-match winless streak and revive its hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.

Ronaldo\'s well-documented fitness has enabled him to stay remarkably healthy throughout his glittered career. With the Juventus striker currently working his way back from a minor right thigh muscle issue, it\'s worth remembering how few matches he has missed due to injury. Before his injury, Ronaldo played in 36 of Juve\'s 39 matches in all competitions this season _ starting 34 of them. The only times he didn\'t play were because coach Massimiliano Allegri wanted to rest him, or because he was suspended. (AP Photo/Antonio Calanni, File)

GERMANY
Borussia Dortmund visits Bayern Munich on Saturday for a game that could decide which team lifts the Bundesliga "salad bowl" trophy at the end of the season.
Dortmund leads Bayern by two points thanks to the Bavarian powerhouse\'s 1-1 draw at Freiburg and two very late goals from Paco Alcacer in Dortmund\'s 2-0 win over Wolfsburg last weekend. Seven rounds remain after this weekend.
Bayern, which is chasing a record-extending seventh consecutive title, was pushed to the limit by second-division Heidenheim in the German Cup on Wednesday before Robert Lewandowski came to the side\'s rescue in a 5-4 win. The side played most of the game with 10 men, so tiredness may also be a factor against Dortmund.
However, Dortmund has problems in defense with Achraf Hakimi out for the rest of the season with a broken foot, and Abdou Diallo and Lukasz Piszczek both doubtful. Raphael Guerreiro is likely to fill in at left back, while the side welcomes back captain Marco Reus following the birth of his first child.
Bayern is hoping goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and defender David Alaba are back in time.

SPAIN
Atletico Madrid has to seize its last chance to challenge for the Spanish league title when it visits leader Barcelona on Saturday.
After reducing the gap by two points in the previous round, Atletico can get within five points of the lead with a win at Camp Nou Stadium.
Barcelona needed two late goals to salvage a draw at Villarreal on Tuesday but remains unbeaten in 15 matches in all competitions and its last league loss was back in November.
Atletico is coming off two straight victories but hasn\'t won at the Camp Nou in 18 consecutive matches, since 2006. Atletico\'s last win against Barcelona in all competitions was in 2016 in the Champions League.
Third-place Real Madrid, five points behind Atletico and with little to play for the rest of the season, will try to rebound from a league loss at Valencia -the team\'s first since the return of Zinedine Zidane- when it hosts Eibar on Saturday.

ENGLAND
Chasing an unprecedented quadruple of trophies, Manchester City looks to reach the FA Cup final but could be replaced at the top of the Premier League by Liverpool before the weekend has begun.
Second-place Liverpool is one point behind City heading into its away match against Southampton on Friday. It is one of the toughest of Liverpool\'s remaining six games, with Southampton recently finding some form in its fight to avoid relegation.
City isn\'t in Premier League action because it faces Brighton on Saturday in the first of this weekend\'s FA Cup semifinals at Wembley Stadium. The other semifinal match is between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Watford on Sunday.
Also in the league, Arsenal can move into third place, above fierce rival Tottenham, by beating Everton on Sunday. Tottenham, which doesn\'t play this weekend, could even be bumped out of the top four as fifth-place Chelsea hosts out-of-form West Ham on Monday.
Third-place Tottenham is one point clear of both Arsenal and Chelsea.

FRANCE
With a 20-point lead in the French league, Paris Saint-Germain is just two wins away from a sixth title in seven years.
PSG could even wrap up the title on Sunday if it beats Strasbourg and second-place Lille fails to win at Reims.
Despite the absence of several key players because of injury, including Neymar, Edinson Cavani and Angel Di Maria, the defending champions have showed no sign of slowing down since their disappointing exit from the Champions League last month.
PSG, which in any case will be guaranteed of the title with a win over Lille on April 14, qualified for a fifth straight French Cup final in midweek ahead of Sunday\'s game at the Parc des Princes.
Behind the runaway leader, Lille and Lyon are involved in a tight race for the second automatic Champions League spot. Lille faces a tough trip to Champagne while Lyon takes on Dijon at home in need of a good result to stay in contact with its northern rival.
With eight matches left to play, Lille holds a four-point lead over Lyon.

DUBLIN, April 4 (Reuters) - Ireland\'s largest newspaper group, Independent News & Media, said on Thursday that it had received an approach in relation to a possible offer for the company.
INM, which owns Ireland\'s highest selling daily and Sunday newspapers, said discussions were at a preliminary stage and advised shareholders not to take any action as there was no certainty that any offer will be made or what the terms may be.
The group\'s shares rose 23 percent to 0.09 euros after the statement.
The Irish Times reported earlier on Thursday that INM Chief Executive Officer, Michael Doorly, raised the prospect of a sale in meetings with the Dublin investment community this week. INM noted the recent press speculation in its statement.
The Irish Times quoted sources as saying German media group Axel Springer had taken a look at INM in the past, while Norwegian group Schibsted has also been rumoured to have an interest.
INM, which has a market capitalisation of just over 100 million euros, has struggled with flagging profits in recent years and is currently subject to a court-ordered investigation into corporate governance issues.
Ireland\'s High Court approved an application by the state\'s corporate watchdog last September to appoint inspectors to investigate potentially unlawful conduct at the group, including allegations that journalists\xc2\xb4 data might have been accessed for an "improper purpose."

MILAN (AP) - Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte has inaugurated the twisting 44-story Generali Tower designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid.
The 190-meter (623-foot) tower, which will serve as a headquarters for the Italian insurance company Generali, was dedicated Tuesday on the first day of the annual Milan Furniture Fair that celebrates design.
The Generali Tower is one of three skyscrapers that punctuate "CityLife," a redevelopment project of the old fair grounds that incorporates parks, apartments, offices and a vast shopping area. The other towers were designed by Daniel Libeskind and Arata Isozaki.
Hadid\'s tower twists as it rises, with the upper floors facing Milan\'s centerpiece Duomo cathedral in the center of the city.
Generali chairman Gabriele Galateri called the tower "a true element of development for Milan," with a focus on sustainability.

He believes a refreshing break will be conducive to European qualification
Nuno Espirito Santo will take Wolves on a warm-weather training break to Marbella for a final recharge of batteries ahead of attempts to qualify for Europe via the Premier League.
Wolves lost their chance to make the Europa League through the FA Cup after being beaten by Watford in Sunday\'s Wembley semi-final, but the club are determined to finish the season strongly.
Nuno has taken his team to the Spanish resort before, most recently in February in between an FA Cup replay against Shrewsbury and a Monday night match with Newcastle, and he places value on a change of scenery getting the best from his players.
Nuno Espirito Santo is preparing to take Wolves on a training break to Marbella next week
In an itinerary that has been in the diary for a month, the Wolves squad and staff will fly out immediately after facing Southampton at St Mary\'s on Saturday and then spend five days training and bonding in sunnier climes.\xc2\xa0
After returning on Thursday next week, Wolves host Brighton at Molineux on Easter Saturday, with four further games against Arsenal, Watford, Fulham and Liverpool.
Nuno wants his players in peak shape for the run-in, with a target of finishing seventh achievable.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0

The trip is also expected to provide comfort after the bruising way victory slipped from their grasp against Javi Gracia\'s team.
Nuno said: \'Now is a moment we have to suffer together. Let\'s look at it and try to improve. We have to face it. Nothing we can say or do now will change it.
\'We have to stick together, know it will be hard, but let\'s look at the future and still to go for it. Specifically we have to become a better team. There is more to come.\'

FRANKFURT, April 5 (Reuters) - Europe is facing yet another make-or-break week.
With an emergency EU summit over Brexit and an ECB policy meeting on the agenda, officials will be under pressure to take decisive steps to soothe concerns ahead of a set-piece gathering of the global financial elite in Washington.
But the temptation will be great to stick with the bloc\'s rich tradition of just kicking the can down the road.
The deadline for Britain to leave the EU, seen as set in stone just days ago, is again in flux as both sides are openly discussing an extension, even if that means Britain must cross another red line by participating in May\'s European elections.
The apparent softening of British Prime Minister Theresa May\'s position suggests the end game is far from imminent.
Another EU summit muddle would, however, keep economic uncertainty at fever pitch, weighing on sentiment that is already dragging down growth across Europe and raising recession fears.
A long extension - and taking part in EU elections - also carries the risk of a Conservative Party mutiny, which could force an already weakened May out.
"Such leadership changes are always unpredictable and, in this instance could be brutal, with more centrist elements of the party struggling against a membership whose views on Brexit are increasingly hardline," JP Morgan economic Malcolm Barr said.
But blurring the red lines suggests Britain is keen to avoid the most damaging of all outcomes - a hard Brexit.
For the EU, a longer extension also carries the benefit that Britain\'s departure would not occur during the crucial month of the election campaign, which will determine who leads both the EU and, after Mario Draghi\'s term ends this autumn, the European Central Bank.
Taking a hard Brexit off the table would also allow British officials to put on a brave face at the IMF\'s spring meeting in Washington starting on Friday, letting the gathering focus on broader trade issues.
NARROW PATH
Still, the delay solves little in itself.
Any concession by May to win votes on a deal from Britain\'s opposition Labour Party is likely to lose her Conservative MPs.
That suggests the path to any majority outcome is quite narrow, keeping the chance of an eventual no-deal Brexit uncomfortably high.
"Despite the switch to a cross-party approach, the risk of an election remains high because the path towards a successful \'meaningful vote\' is treacherous, due to the deep divisions within both parties," Andrew Goodwin at Oxford Economics said.
The cost of the Brexit saga is already tangible for the EU.
Global trade tensions are weighing even more heavily, and the steady flow of bad news is keeping investment and business sentiment in a negative spiral, depressing growth for the third straight quarter.
The ECB, the bloc\'s first port of call in case of growth weakness, has already eased policy, exhausting much of its firepower during years of crisis fighting. More generally, central banks lack potent tools to offset imported economic troubles.
Having already delayed a rate hike, the ECB will sit on the sidelines for now, while economists expect more easing later in the year.
"Since the main refinancing rate is already at zero percent, such easing is likely to amount to further unconventional measures," Commerzbank said.
"We therefore expect the ECB to decide in the autumn ...to promise unchanged key rates ...until the end of 2020," it added. (Reporting by Balazs Koranyi; editing by John Stonestreet)


BERLIN (AP) - German government statistics show crime dropped in the country last year, including violent offenses.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said as he presented an annual crime report on Tuesday that "every crime is one too many, but objectively, this is the lowest level in decades."
Police agencies recorded more than 5.6 million cases in 2018, 3.6 percent fewer than in 2017. They included 185,377 violent crimes, a 1.9 percent decrease from the year before.
Despite the overall decline, the number of drug offenses recorded increased by 6.1% and 13.6 percent more involving dissemination of illegal pornography. Seehofer internet communication made both easier.
The overall case clearance rate of 57.7% was slightly higher than in 2017, when it was 57.1 percent. The clearance rate for solved murder and manslaughter cases was 96.1%.

BRUSSELS, April 7 (Reuters) - Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini sends texts with smileys to French far-right leader Marine Le Pen and posts selfies with Austrian far-right politician Heinz-Christian Strache.
The face of the leader of Italy\'s far-right League party is beamed onto big screens at right-wing rallies from Prague to Sofia.
Buoyed by his own success and voter fatigue with mainstream parties, Salvini is trying to build bridges before elections on May 26 to the European Parliament, the European Union\'s legislature.
With the two biggest political blocs expected to lose their combined majority, he and other far-right leaders hope to form an opposition, eurosceptic alliance with enough seats in the assembly to block or hold up legislation.
"Our idea is to come together ... into a new party that better reflects the eurosceptical views that unite us," Salvini\'s foreign affairs advisor Marco Zanni told Reuters. "Now is our chance to unite forces once and for all."
But when Salvini starts his campaign for the elections on Monday in Milan, representatives of only three, relatively small far-right European parties will be present.
Le Pen will not be there. Nor will representatives of Jaroslaw Kaczynski\'s Law and Justice party (PiS), which governs Poland.
Salvini promises a much bigger rally next month. But the absence of Le Pen and other leading far-right and nationalist leaders speaks to the policy differences and rivalries that have long stood in the way of unity among such groups.
Far-right leaders share the broad ideological goals of curbing the EU\'s perceived liberal course and returning power to the member states\' capitals. But they differ in other areas, and an attempt by U.S. President Donald Trump\'s former strategist, Steve Bannon, to act as a power broker among Europe\'s populist groups has fizzled.
BIRDS OF A FEATHER?
Investors expect heightened political uncertainty after the May 26 election, in which 705 members of the European Parliament (MEPs) will be elected, or 751 if Britain fails to leave the EU as planned.
General dissatisfaction over slow economic growth, security threats posed by Islamist militants and a backlash against migration across open EU borders have boosted support for eurosceptic nationalists in many member states.
"There is a growing confidence of voters to go against the norm," said Susi Dennison, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. "The \'anti- forces\' are much more motivated right now than the pro-Europeans."
Their gains and Britain\'s planned departure from the EU will mean a shake-up of the pan-national groups created by parties in the EU parliament, whose main role is checking and amending EU laws drawn up by the executive European Commission.
Salvini\'s anti-immigrant League is forecast to more than quadruple its representation in the EU assembly with 27 seats.
Along with the projected rise for Le Pen\'s National Rally and Strache\'s Freedom Party of Austria, which is in a coalition government with Strache as vice-chancellor, the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) group to which they belong could be boosted to 61 seats from 37.
Salvini, whose party co-rules Italy, wants to embrace other leaders whose parties are in rival groups such as Kaczynski.
The two held a meeting in Warsaw in January, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban hailed the prospect of them forming an alliance as one of the greatest developments of this year.
Forming one big political group can also unlock funds and opportunities for patronage.
"They\'re going to get much more resources if they\'re able to sit together," said Cas Mudde, an expert on the far-right at the University of Georgia.
But policy differences make it likely that parties critical of the EU will remain divided into at least two groupings, one centred around Salvini and the other around Kaczynski.
Salvini admires Russian President Vladimir Putin - Kaczynski vilifies him. Both are anti-immigration but at odds over how to handle it. Italy is net giver to the EU budget, Poland is a net receiver. Their views on the economy do not align.
For right-wing parties in Denmark, Finland and Sweden which see Russia as a threat, Salvini and Le Pen\'s pro-Kremlin sympathies are also a red line.
"It is a crucial aspect for many countries," Sweden Democrat leader Jimmie Akesson told Reuters. "It will not succeed, there will be no such group."
Many parties competing at the national level will also find it difficult to sit together.
Orban has chosen to remain with the parliament\'s biggest political grouping despite being suspended from it last month. For all his praise of coalition-building among eurosceptics, being in a group with Europe\'s power brokers confers a mainstream respectability that other populists lack.
Some hope that will change after the election.
"Leaving a strong group to join a weak group is a difficult political decision, but leaving to join a group that is also quite strong and growing is less so," said Ryszard Legutko, a PiS lawmaker and co-chair of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group.
"It is the first time there\'s a real chance things might change, that this political, even ideological monopoly can be somehow undermined," Legutko said.
IN FROM THE COLD
Links among the far-right remain largely limited to personal relationships. When leaders who have long been isolated at home and lack influence abroad attend each other\'s rallies, it is about showing they are not marginal.
"It is about validating one another," said Duncan McDonnell, Professor of Politics in the School of Government and International Relations at Griffith University. But he said the far-right increasingly saw itself as "part of a new wave". The Alternative for Germany (AfD) could win many more seats in the next European Parliament, opinion polls show, and might throw its hat in with Salvini\'s ENF group. The polls show the Forum for Democracy (FvD) in the Netherlands, led by Thierry Baudet, could win four new seats in the EU assembly and it has said it will join Poland\'s PiS in the ECR.
Spanish newcomer Vox has become the darling of eurosceptic groups following its success in a regional election last December in Spain, which until then had been resistant to the populist currents sweeping Europe.
Vox is now being courted by both by Poland\'s PiS and Salvini\'s League. But looking ahead to the next European Parliament - where polls suggest Vox will win about five seats, up from none today -- Vox leader Santiago Abascal told Reuters: "It may be that we\'ll be alone."
Vox has capitalised on domestic tensions over Catalan separatism - it regards Catalonia as an integral part of Spain - but some other far-right parties do not share its view.
"Their support of the (separatists\') coup d\'etat by Catalonia is an enormous barrier (to cooperation)," he said.
Even if parties are not the same group, Zanni of Salvini\'s League says there will be greater cooperation to try to influence or thwart EU policy.
"The risk is longer-term paralysis," Dennison said, "that over time will erode the idea of EU as an effective actor."
But European Parliament strategists say younger right-wing political groups have shown far weaker party discipline.
"The eurosceptics are a wing of many feathers, and I\'m not sure it will beat effectively," said one senior official in the European People\'s Party, the main centre-right group.

BERLIN (AP) - Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s Cabinet has approved extending Germany\'s military missions in Africa for another year.
The dpa news agency reported Wednesday that that includes German troops taking part in a European Union training mission in Mali known as EUTM, and the United Nations "Minusma" peacekeeping force there.
Dpa reports the Cabinet also plans to extend Germany\'s commitment to the EU\'s anti-piracy mission Atalanta that operates off the Horn of Africa, but to reduce its maximum troop numbers from 600 to 400. There are currently 80 troops taking part.
Germany currently has some 180 troops involved in the EUTM mission, with a maximum of 350. A further 900 are in Mali and Niger as part of the Minusma force, with a maximum of 1,100.
Those troop commitments are to remain unchanged.


BRUSSELS (AP) - The Latest on Britain\'s exit from the European Union (all times local):
11:35 a.m.
Groups representing manufacturers in the U.K. and across the continent have appealed to European leaders to work with Britain to avoid a divorce from the bloc without a deal.
Make UK and sister organization Ceemet issued a joint letter to heads of state and chief negotiator Michel Barnier warning of economic shock in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The groups say that while they recognize efforts have been made to address the chaos that a no-deal scenario would cause, "it must be clear that neither the EU nor the UK are ready, and as a consequence European industry is also not adequately prepared, for this cliff edge scenario."
Prime Minister Theresa May travels to Brussels Wednesday to ask for another extension to Britain\'s departure, until June 30. Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU on Friday.

9:30 a.m.
European Council President Donald Tusk is meeting leaders including British Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of an emergency summit to decide whether to grant the United Kingdom a further delay in its departure from the European Union.
Donald Tusk meets the leaders of Lithuania, Latvia, The Netherlands and finally May shortly before Wednesday evening\'s summit begins.
It\'s likely to be a rough day for the embattled British leader as she pleads for a second extension until June 30, to prevent Britain\'s departure now scheduled for Friday.
Tusk has suggested an even longer delay of up to a year with conditions attached to ensure Britain does not stymie EU decision making if it remains a member.
EU countries have become increasingly exasperated with the political division and uncertainty in Britain.

April 4 (Reuters) - A rally in European shares stalled on Thursday near the eight-month high reached the previous day, with banking mergers in focus while investors awaited more developments in U.S.-China trade talks.
At 0920 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.35 percent, having risen more than 3 percent in the past four sessions on hopes that a U.S.-China trade deal could be imminent after both sides reported progress.
Most major bourses in the region were in the red; only Spain eked out gains.
Commerzbank shares rose about 3 percent as the race to acquire the German lender heated up. Two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that UniCredit could explore a merger with Commerzbank if talks with Deutsche Bank fall through.
But they said UniCredit would not crash the Commerzbank-Deutsche talks, and UniCredit\'s focus for now was on its turnaround plan.
The news could rekindle expectations of further consolidation in the battered European banking sector, which has underperformed the STOXX 600 this year.
"UniCredit is probably the best acquirer for a bank like Commerzbank because it has a good restructuring track record in Germany," KBW analysts wrote in a note.
"But in theory it could be complicated, particularly from the capital point of view."
Dampening sentiment was data out of Germany that showed an unexpected drop in industrial orders in February, hit by a slump in foreign demand. Germany\'s leading economic institutes also cut their forecasts for 2019 growth by more than half on Thursday.
Losses in heavyweight BP and Shell weighed down the oil and gas sector, while basic resources stocks slipped after seven straight sessions of gains.
Sharp falls in financial stocks Lloyds, Direct Line and St James\'s Place, which traded ex-dividend, also weighed down Britain\'s FTSE 100.
The exporter-heavy index also continued to be pressured by a rise in sterling, boosted by hopes of progress or at least a longer Brexit delay as Prime Minister Theresa May seeks a joint approach with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to end a parliamentary deadlock.
Saga Plc shares crashed nearly 30 percent, on course for their worst daily performance, after the over-50s tourism and insurance firm forecast lower annual underlying pretax profit and cut its dividend as it struggles to keep up in a competitive motor and home insurance sector.
Steel maker Thyssenkrupp fell nearly 3 percent as workers demanded substantial guarantees for jobs and plants even if a planned joint venture with India\'s Tata Steel falls apart.
The French supermarket chain Casino fell about 5 percent, hit by a Morgan Stanley downgrade, a day after Moody\'s cut its credit rating on growing concerns about the firm\'s debt.
Among bright spots, UDG Healthcare led gains on the STOXX 600 and the UK\'s midcap index after Barclays upgraded the stock to "overweight" from "equal weight".
Shares in British home repairs provider HomeServe Plc also advanced after forecasting full-year adjusted pretax profit at the upper end of market expectations. (Reporting by Medha Singh and Agamoni Ghosh in Bengaluru, additional reporting by Helen Reid; Editing by Kevin Liffey)


BRUSSELS (AP) - The Latest on Britain\'s exit from the European Union (all times local):
12:45 p.m.
The European Union\'s legislature has warned British Prime Minister Theresa May to come to the Brexit summit with clear indications on how she hopes to turn the cross-party talks with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn into a success.
The European Parliament said in a statement Wednesday that May "cannot come empty-handed."
And the legislators told the EU leaders that they have to make sure that Britain will not become obstructionist if a long extension to their departure is granted.
They said the summit "would be advised to provide the U.K. with an extension which should be appropriately framed to respect the principle of sincere cooperation."

Groups representing manufacturers in the U.K. and across the continent have appealed to European leaders to work with Britain to avoid a divorce from the bloc without a deal.
Make UK and sister organization Ceemet issued a joint letter to heads of state and chief negotiator Michel Barnier warning of economic shock in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The groups say that while they recognize efforts have been made to address the chaos that a no-deal scenario would cause, "it must be clear that neither the EU nor the UK are ready, and as a consequence European industry is also not adequately prepared, for this cliff edge scenario."
Prime Minister Theresa May travels to Brussels Wednesday to ask for another extension to Britain\'s departure, until June 30. Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU on Friday.

9:30 a.m.
European Council President Donald Tusk is meeting leaders including British Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of an emergency summit to decide whether to grant the United Kingdom a further delay in its departure from the European Union.
Donald Tusk meets the leaders of Lithuania, Latvia, The Netherlands and finally May shortly before Wednesday evening\'s summit begins.
It\'s likely to be a rough day for the embattled British leader as she pleads for a second extension until June 30, to prevent Britain\'s departure now scheduled for Friday.
Tusk has suggested an even longer delay of up to a year with conditions attached to ensure Britain does not stymie EU decision making if it remains a member.
EU countries have become increasingly exasperated with the political division and uncertainty in Britain.

LONDON, April 1 (Reuters) - Northern Ireland\'s Democratic Unionist Party will not support any of the four alternative Brexit options being voted upon in parliament on Monday, DUP lawmaker Sammy Wilson told parliament.
"We will not be supporting any of these arrangements, 1) because they do not safeguard the issue of the union and 2) because they do not deliver on Brexit," Wilson said.
The series of indicative votes has been designed to try to find an alternative Brexit plan to help break the deadlock in parliament. (Reporting by Kylie MacLellan, writing by William James; editing by Guy Faulconbridge)


BRUSSELS, April 2 (Reuters) - The European Union has not raised major concerns about the impact of Vodafone buying Liberty Global\'s assets on the cable market in Germany or on fixed line-mobile convergence in the Czech Republic, sources said.
Regulators are looking at the impact of the $22 billion deal on competition in the broadband market between cable and DSL operators, on the combined group\'s relationship with broadcasters and any affect on the wholesale cable TV market, the sources said.

MILAN (AP) - The Latest on migrants and asylum-seekers in Europe (all times local):
1:25 p.m.
Germany says it has asked the European Commission to find a safe port for a German humanitarian group\'s boat carrying 64 rescued migrants. Berlin says it is willing to take some of them in but expects European partners to do so as well.
The group, Sea-Eye, asked Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a port for the migrants on the Alan Kurdi ship. Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers.
German Interior Ministry spokesman Stefan Ruwwe-Gloesenkamp said Berlin has asked the European Union\'s executive Commission to coordinate the search for a safe port. He said Germany trusts that "a large number of member states" will be prepared to take in migrants and Berlin is ready to do "its part."

1:20 p.m.
Protesting migrants in Greece have blocked Athens\' main train station and disrupted rail services, apparently prompted by false reports on social media that restrictions on travel to northern Europe had been lifted.
Police said about 300 protesters gathered Friday at Larissis Station near central Athens, with many sitting on the tracks in front of trains.
Authorities did not immediately intervene to disperse the demonstrators, while officials from the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, were trying to persuade them to leave voluntarily.
The protest occurred a day after clashes broke out near a camp for refugees and migrants in northern Greece, after protesters tried to break through a police cordon and reach the border with North Macedonia, which has been fenced off and heavily policed for the past three years.

11:40 a.m.
The German humanitarian group Sea-Eye says it is asking Berlin to use diplomatic channels to find a safe port for the 64 migrants it rescued off Libya earlier this week.
Sea-Watch spokesman Carlotta Weibl said Friday that the rescue boat Alan Kurdi remains in international waters off Lampedusa and will not approach Italy\'s southernmost island until it has permission.
She said conditions on board were worsening and that a storm was approaching. She said a request has been made to the German foreign ministry to find a solution.
Malta and Italy have refused to open ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying their activities encourage smugglers to pack unseaworthy rubber dinghies with migrants looking for sanctuary in Europe.

A 39ft-long Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton which weighs the same as four Mini Cooper cars has arrived in Glasgow on the latest stop of its European tour.
Trix the T-rex will be housed in a bespoke, climate-controlled 600 square metre pavilion at the city\xe2\x80\x99s Kelvin Hall.
It will be on display to the public from April 18 until July 31 in an interactive exhibition which also includes a painted reconstruction of the 5,000kg dinosaur.
The T.rex in Town tour started in September 2016 and has visited Salzburg, Barcelona, Paris and Lisbon while waiting for a new home to be completed at the Naturalis Biodiversity Centre in Leiden, Holland.
It is said to be unlikely that the T-rex will go on such a tour again.
The 39ft-long skeleton was discovered in Montana in the United States (Naturalis Biodiversity Center/PA)
Steph Scholten, director of The Hunterian which organised the exhibition, said he is \xe2\x80\x9cdelighted\xe2\x80\x9d to welcome the fossil to Scotland.
He said: \xe2\x80\x9cBringing this major touring exhibition to the city will allow thousands of Scots, and visitors to Scotland, to see one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most iconic dinosaur species.
\xe2\x80\x9cTyrannosaurus rex skeletons are very rare finds and Trix is the only real touring T-rex fossil in the world. This is a major coup for Glasgow, which is the only UK stop on her European tour.
\xe2\x80\x9cT-rex in Town offers a once in a lifetime experience for visitors to come face to face with a real T-rex and learn about her life through this superb interactive exhibition.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe hope everyone who comes to see this incredible dinosaur specimen will be as excited to see her as we are.\xe2\x80\x9d

\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s incredible to watch the skilled team from Naturalis in the Netherlands bring this extremely rare real dinosaur skeleton to life in Glasgow.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe look forward to welcoming many dinosaur fans to Kelvin Hall over the coming months, where Glaswegians and visitors to the city can enjoy this unique opportunity to stare into the eyes of one of the most terrifying predators ever to have stalked the earth.
\xe2\x80\x9cUntil May 6 visitors can also marvel at Dippy, the Natural History Museum\xe2\x80\x99s famous Diplodocus, at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe trust these spectacular exhibitions will inspire curiosity about the natural world around us.\xe2\x80\x9d

The Government has tabled an order enabling elections to the European Parliament to be held in Britain if the country has not left the EU by the time they take place next month.
The Day of Poll Order sets the date for the elections on May 23, but the Cabinet Office said they would automatically be cancelled if the UK left before then.
The announcement comes as Theresa May prepares for talks on Tuesday with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin and President Emmanuel Macron in Paris ahead of another crucial EU summit in Brussels the following day.
The Prime Minister has acknowledged that if the EU is to grant an extension to the Article 50 withdrawal process beyond Friday \xe2\x80\x93 the final day for calling the elections in the UK \xe2\x80\x93 the Government would have be prepared for the UK to take part in them.
However, a Cabinet Office spokesman said it was still the Government\xe2\x80\x99s aim to leave with a deal before that became necessary.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt remains the Government\xe2\x80\x99s intention to leave the EU with a deal and pass the necessary legislation before May 22, so that we do not need to participate in European parliamentary elections,\xe2\x80\x9d the spokesman said.
It remains the Government\xc2\xb4s intention to leave the EU before May 22 (Stefan Rousseau)
\xe2\x80\x9cAs a responsible Government today we have taken the necessary steps required by law should we have to participate.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe Day of Poll Order provides returning officers with a date to hold potential European Parliamentary elections, but it does not make these elections inevitable as leaving the EU before the date of election automatically removes our obligation to take part.\xe2\x80\x9d


Cannabis being sold on the streets of Europe may be contaminated with faeces, scientists have discovered.
Samples sold in Madrid were tested and found E.coli bacteria in three quarters\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x93 the diarrhoea and vomiting bug can be transmitted through human faeces.
Most of the samples were too dangerous to be consumed and pose a \'public health risk\', the researchers said.
Though the study was only conducted in Spain, one expert told MailOnline the same \'unusual\' thing could be happening in the UK and other places in Europe.
This is because of the way the drug is sometimes smuggled into countries \xe2\x80\x93 by swallowing it and later excreting it with the use of laxatives.
Experts said the findings are worrying considering some people who use cannabis do so to try and alleviate health problems.\xc2\xa0
Tonnes of cannabis being sold on the streets of Europe may be contaminated with faeces, scientists in Madrid have discovered
The research team, led by Jos\xc3\xa9 Manuel Moreno P\xc3\xa9rez, a pharmacologist from the Universidad Complutense in Madrid, collected 90 samples in Madrid over a year.
The samples were separated into either \'acorns\' or \'ingots\', which are the shapes they are bought in.
Each sample was then broken down into smaller pieces and looked at under a microscope, the authors write in the journal Forensic Science International.\xc2\xa0
They found that 93 per cent of the acorn-shaped samples were contaminated with E.coli, as well as 29.4 per cent of the ingot samples.
Some 10 per cent of the cannabis samples were also contaminated with Aspergillus, a dangerous fungus that can cause serious health problems such as lung infections.
A total of 88.3 per cent of the cannabis samples were not suitable for consumption based on the amount of E.coli contamination allowed by guidelines in the EU and US.
The odour of each sample was also recorded and 40 per cent of acorns had an aroma of faeces, the researchers said. All of these were contaminated with E.coli.
The research team, led by Jos\xc3\xa9 Manuel Moreno P\xc3\xa9rez, a pharmacologist from the Universidad Complutense in Madrid, looked at 90 samples under a microscope. Pictured, an acorn shape
This led the researchers to suggest the way the cannabis is transported into the country \xe2\x80\x93 where it is illegal \xe2\x80\x93 may be to blame.
Mr\xc2\xa0P\xc3\xa9rez told Spanish newspaper El Pa\xc3\xads the cannabis is wrapped up in small plastic pellets and swallowed before the drug smugglers then \'take a laxative and expel\' them in a toilet.
WHAT IS E. COLI?\xc2\xa0 E.coli \xe2\x80\x93 full name\xc2\xa0Escherichia coli \xe2\x80\x93 is a bacteria commonly found in people\'s bodies and which usually does not cause any illness. However, it can cause infection in the gut or urinary tract infections (UTIs) which can have unpleasant symptoms. Diarrhoea, abdominal pain and fever are all common effects, while more serious cases of the infection can cause bloody diarrhoea, dehydration or kidney failure. Advice for avoiding E. coli infection includes good\xc2\xa0hand-washing,\xc2\xa0washing fruits and vegetables, cooking meat thoroughly and keeping raw meat separate from other food, and not swallowing water when swimming. E. coli can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a rare disease of the blood which can lead to potentially deadly kidney failure.\xc2\xa0
The acorns are then sold by dealers to unknowing users who, the authors pointed out, may believe contamination cannot cause harm if it is inhaled.\xc2\xa0
Ian Hamilton, a lecturer in mental health and addiction at the University of York, told MailOnline the findings were \'very unusual\' because this is the sort of thing you would associate with the smuggling of a drug like cocaine.
He said: \'This highlights just how much you don\'t know what you will be exposed to. The same thing could happen in the UK as has happened in Madrid.\'
However, he said the contamination of E.coli could have been from the hands of the people who processed the drugs.
He added the results are particularly concerning for those with existing health conditions who use cannabis.
\'We know that some people who have problems with their health use cannabis to try and alleviate the problems they have. This group will be particularly vulnerable to this type of contamination which could make their underlying health problem much worse.
\'The risk of exposure to these type of bacteria is always there in an illegal market where some dealers and suppliers don\'t have to adhere to any quality control.\'
People with weakened immune systems or lung diseases, such as asthma or cystic fibrosis, are at a higher risk of developing health problems due to Aspergillus fungus.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
The findings, the authors said, are similar to that of a study which analysed samples of cannabis sold in coffee shops in the Netherlands, which also found that 80 per cent were contaminated with E.coli.\xc2\xa0


BERLIN (AP) - German authorities have carried out raids on groups suspected of helping the militant Palestinian group Hamas under the guise of providing humanitarian aid.
The interior ministry said some 90 properties across Germany associated with an "Islamist network" were searched on Wednesday. It said the network was headed by two groups based in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, WWR Help and Ansaar International.
The ministry said there are indications that the network provided financial and propaganda support to Hamas, a longtime enemy of Israel that runs the Gaza Strip and was listed as a terror group by the European Union in 2001.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that "anyone who supports Hamas under the cover of humanitarian aid flouts fundamental value judgments of our constitution."

BERLIN, April 3 (Reuters) - Germans with a second nationality who fight abroad for groups like Islamic State will lose their citizenship, the cabinet agreed in a draft law on Wednesday intended to deter future militants.
Like other Western countries, Germany faces a conundrum of how to deal with citizens who travel to the Middle East to join violent Islamist causes like IS whose self-proclaimed "caliphate" was eliminated last month.
The measure, which needs parliamentary approval, would exclude minors, cover only future cases, and not apply to single nationality Germans who could otherwise be left stateless.
"This will send a signal to IS supporters, to those thinking of travelling to IS areas," government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters.
More than 1,000 Germans have left their country for Middle East war zones since 2013 and the government has been debating how to deal with them as U.S.-backed forces took IS\'s last patch of territory in Syria and rounded up prisoners.
About a third have returned to Germany, another third are believed to have died, and the rest are thought to be still in Iraq and Syria, including those detained by Iraqi forces and U.S.-backed fighters in Syria, according to German intelligence officials.
In February, U.S. President Donald Trump urged Britain, France and Germany to take back more than 800 captured Islamic State fighters and put them on trial.
Germany said it would take back fighters only if the suspects have consular access, adding that in principle, all of its citizens and those suspected of having fought for IS have the right to return.
In one high-profile case, Britain in February revoked the citizenship of a teenager who had left London aged 15 to join IS in Syria. The case of Shamima Begum highlighted the security, legal and ethical dilemmas facing European governments dealing with those who swore allegiance to a group determined to destroy the West.
Germany joined the military campaign against IS militants in Syria in a support role by deploying Tornado reconnaissance jets, refuelling aircraft and a frigate to the region, after an appeal from close partner France for Berlin to do more. (Writing by Paul Carrel; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne)


By Ekaterina Kravtsova
LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) edged up this week for the first time since last December, reacting to a jump in European gas prices.
LNG trading has been subdued, however, with many market players at a major industry event in Shanghai.
Prices for May delivery in northeast Asia are estimated at $4.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), a $0.10 rise from last week but still near their lowest level in three years.
LNG derivatives also traded higher this week.
The rise in LNG prices was due to a pick up in gas prices in the Netherlands and Britain, the two major European gas hubs, because of a drop in supply from Norway through the Langeled pipeline, gas traders said.
The May contracts on both hubs traded above $5/mmBtu on Friday.
With current market conditions, Refinitiv analysts said they expect a 900 million cubic metre reduction in Norwegian supplies for April.
Traders said there could be a correction in European prices next week, however, given that gas markets remain oversupplied due to LNG arrivals and high storage levels.
"I think it is a temporary knee-jerk reaction to lower Norwegian flows. Nothing else has changed," one gas trader said, referring to this week\'s modest price rise.
CARGOES
PetroChina International (London) offered three spot cargoes of LNG from Russia\'s Yamal LNG plant for delivery in Europe in May.
Angola LNG also offered a cargo for May delivery.
Traders estimate prices of LNG delivered to Europe to be at around an $0.35/mmBtu discount to the Dutch gas hub benchmark, meaning Asian prices are still at a discount to European prices.
On the demand side, there were two tenders this week for cargoes delivering late this year and next year, suggesting buyers are trying to lock in the current low prices.
India\'s H-Energy issued a tender for 15 cargoes for delivery over the fourth quarter of 2019 and throughout 2020. The buyer is not expected to award all of the cargoes, market sources said.
GNL Chile is looking for a cargo for late September delivery and a cargo for mid-November delivery in a tender closing April 8, an LNG trader said.
There is also some spot demand in India driven by the gas needs of refineries and power plants, with Indian LNG buyers managing to buy at a discount to Asian prices, a source familiar with the market said.
MAINTENANCE
A number of production facilities around the world are carrying out maintenance but the impact on prices is seen as minimal as supply remains ample.
Oil major BP has shut down one train of its Tangguh LNG plant in Indonesia for 23-days until mid-April.
In Qatar, some facilities were offline this week, market sources said, and up to two trains in Oman\'s three-train facility are expected to be on a 15-day planned maintenance this month.
One train at Russia\'s Sakhalin 2 plant experienced an operational failure on Wednesday but all trains were back online the next day, a spokeswoman for Sakhalin Energy told Reuters.
Meanwhile, strong winds in Norway delayed some of the transhipments of Yamal cargoes at Honningsvag, and two Sabine Pass trains in the United States have been offline since March 22.
Some producers could be carrying out maintenance earlier than scheduled this spring due to the subdued prices, sources said. (Reporting by Ekaterina Kravtsova; editing by Nina Chestney and Kirsten Donovan)


MOSCOW (AP) - The European Court of Human Rights ruled Tuesday that a Russian court order placing opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest in 2014 was unlawful and politically driven.
Navalny, a prominent opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin who has faced repeated arrests, hailed the ruling as a victory and congratulated his supporters.
The court in Strasbourg ruled that the house-arrest order had not been justified and noted that it was apparent that Navalny had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities. It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 20,000 euros ($22,550) in damages.
Putin\'s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin disagrees with the ruling, adding that it will be up to the Russian Justice Ministry to take the necessary action. Russia could appeal the verdict to the court\'s highest chamber.
It\'s the second time that the court has ruled against Russia in a matter of months. Last November, the court\'s highest chamber found that Russian authorities violated multiple human rights in detaining Navalny seven times from 2012 to 2014, and that two of the arrests were expressly aimed at "suppressing political pluralism."
It ordered Russia to pay Navalny 63,000 euros in damages, and called on Russia to fix legislation to "take due regard of the fundamental importance of the right to peaceful assembly."
Russia is obliged to carry out the court\'s rulings, which enforce the European Convention on Human Rights, but it has delayed implementing past rulings from the court and argued against them as encroaching on Russian judicial sovereignty.


April 4 (Reuters) - European investment banking fees fell 25 percent to $4.9 billion during the first quarter of 2019 from a year earlier, with mergers and acquisitions involving European companies at their lowest in six years, a review by Refinitiv showed. The fall in European deals contributed to a 17 percent drop in global deals in the first quarter, as concerns about a global economic slowdown and fears of a no-deal Brexit in Europe deter companies from pursuing big tie-ups. While dealmakers expected a slowdown after 2018 emerged as the third strongest year on record for M&A around the world, they had not expected such a major drop in cross-border activity. Mergers and acquisitions which involved European companies fell 64 percent to $183.2 billion during the first quarter. Fees generated from completed M&A transactions fell 27.9 percent to $1.6 billion, the lowest start to the year since 2013. Debt capital markets underwriting fees totalled $2 billion, down 13.6 percent year-on-year to the lowest level since the first quarter in 2016, according to Refinitiv data analysis. ] European equity and equity-related issuance dropped 43 percent to $25.1 billion during the first quarter, after a 98 percent drop in proceeds raised from just eleven market debuts - the lowest number of issues since the start of 2008. European initial public offerings slumped to their lowest since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis in the first quarter of 2019, as uncertainty over Brexit and the U.S.- China trade dispute left companies not wanting to take their chances.

ROME, April 4 (Reuters) - Italy coach Roberto Mancini has described the racist abuse suffered by Juventus forward Moise Kean in a Serie A match against Cagliari as intolerable and said it was time to put a stop to such incidents.
Kean, who had been jeered throughout the game, stood in front of the Cagliari fans behind the goal and opened his arms after scoring Juve\'s second goal in a 2-0 win on Tuesday.
In response, Cagliari\'s supporters made the noise which is described in Italy as "buu" and is regarded as a racist insult.
"The behaviour towards Kean was intolerable, but it happens often," Mancini said during an event in Rome. "The racist \'buu\' has to be stigmatised, it can\'t go on. It needs action and it needs to be tough.
"The problems are those related to racism and that\'s where you have to start doing something."
Mancini disagreed with suggestions that 19-year-old Kean, who scored in both of Italy\'s Euro 2020 qualifiers he played in last month, brought it on himself with his defiant celebration.
"Kean\'s a golden lad," said Mancini. "Maybe next time he won\'t do it. I think he was distressed."
Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci was among those to say that Kean was partly to blame for the incident although he later backtracked and said he was too hasty with his comments.
"It seems that Bonucci\'s words were misunderstood and he later explained that himself," said Mancini. (Writing by Brian Homewood Editing by Christian Radnedge)


BERLIN (AP) - Chancellor Angela Merkel has received former U.S. President Barack Obama at her office in Berlin for a meeting characterized by German officials as a routine private encounter with a former international peer.
Obama could be seen waving as he left the chancellery alongside Merkel Friday. Merkel\'s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said she has met repeatedly with ex-heads of state and government "with whom she worked together closely and well for a time."
He said the meeting has no implications for current German-U.S. relations. Asked whether it was a signal to President Donald Trump, with whom Germany has a sometimes-complicated relationship, Seibert replied: "I would firmly reject that impression."
Merkel and Obama have already met in Berlin since the former president left office, participating in a discussion at a May 2017 conference.

MOSCOW, April 9 (Reuters) - The European Court of Human Rights ruled on Tuesday that Russia violated the rights of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny by placing him under house arrest in 2014 and imposing other restrictive measures on him.
Navalny was held under house arrest for months from February 2014 while he and his brother Oleg were investigated for embezzlement in a case his supporters called politically motivated.
The court in Strasbourg said in a judgement that the house-arrest order had not been justified and that tough restrictions on him communicating with the outside world had been out of proportion with the criminal charges he faced.
It said it was "apparent he had been treated in that way in order to curtail his public activities".
"Victory," Navalny wrote on social media in response to the ruling. "I am sure this ruling will have important consequences for all those in Russia who are constantly subjected to this kind of lawlessness."
The 42-year-old anti-corruption campaigner is Russia\'s most prominent opposition figure. He sought to compete in Russia\'s presidential elections in March 2018, but was barred because of a prior conviction.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - The Latest on the European Central Bank\'s monetary policy meeting (all times local):
2:45 p.m.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi says that "global headwinds" from trade conflicts are still holding back the eurozone economy even as rising wages continue to help.
Draghi said at a news conference Wednesday that "global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments." Those include the threat of more protectionism that could hurt trade, a pillar of the eurozone economy. The U.S. and China are in a trade war that has affected Europe and the U.S. government has this week said it is considering tariffs on another $11 billion of EU goods.
Draghi also cited turbulence in emerging markets. Draghi spoke after the central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 19 countries that use the euro, left interest rates and its policy promises unchanged.

1:50 p.m.
The European Central Bank has kept its policy promises, interest rates and stimulus settings unchanged as officials weigh looming risks to the economy from Brexit and trade disputes.
The bank, the chief monetary authority for the 19 European Union countries that use the euro as their currency, is facing a conundrum: sagging trade and manufacturing are slowing the economy, though an improving jobs market is propping it up.
Analysts are waiting to hear ECB President Mario Draghi speak at a news conference Thursday, searching for hints about whether the bank will add more monetary stimulus in coming months. Some analysts think the bank may eventually push back the earliest date for an interest rate increase from the end of the year into next year.

LONDON, April 3 (Reuters) - Italy is suffering from an "epidemic" of racism inside soccer stadiums fuelled by right-wing politics, according to the head of European football\'s anti-discrimination watchdog FARE.
Reacting to alleged racist abuse directed towards Juventus striker Moise Kean in Cagliari on Tuesday, FARE\'s executive director Piara Powar said he was not surprised.
"Italy in particular has got a very big problem, I would go as far as to say it\'s an epidemic," Powar told Reuters at a keynote conference organised jointly by UEFA, the English Football Association (FA) and the Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE) network.
"I think part of the problem in Italy is the rhetoric of the right-wing government. It\'s anti-migrant and anti-African and clearly that will always feed into stadiums.
"Then you have a football association that doesn\'t know how to respond, given the government\'s position, and historically hasn\'t responded very well."
In Tuesday\'s incident the 19-year-old Kean, jeered throughout by some Cagliari fans, celebrated his late goal by standing in front of the home fans and opening his arms.
Cagliari\'s fans then made the noise which is described in Italy as "buu" and is regarded as a racist taunt, although some argue it is simply to annoy opposing players regardless of race.
There was no official comment on Wednesday from either club while Serie A\'s disciplinary committee is likely to deal with the incidents on Friday.
Immediately after the game Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci said Kean was "50-50" to blame for the incidents while boss Massimiliano Allegri also questioned his player\'s reaction to scoring the goal.
"That was the most shocking part about it" Powar said.
\'UNBELIEVABLE\'
Former Barcelona and Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure, a guest at the Equal Game conference, described the reaction to Kean by some of his team mates as the "worst scenario".
"It was unbelievable," Ivorian Toure told reporters. "You can\'t imagine how hurt I was when I saw those things happening.
"For me (Bonucci) was disrespectful of his team mate. I don\'t want to be harsh with him but if he was my team mate he would feel me today, believe me.
"Bonucci should be a bit cleverer than that, a bit smarter, because this is a very difficult situation. We want to see things move on and if a footballer, who is Italian and white is talking about this as 50-50....I don\'t want to say more."
Later on Wednesday, Bonucci posted a photograph of himself and Kean playing for Italy on Instagram with the caption: "Regardless of everything in any case.......no to racism."
Powar said his organisation was seeing a rise in discrimination across Europe with fans inside stadium often echoing the country\'s politics.
"In Hungary, for example, where the prime minister says he wants a white Christian country, we have seen banners inside stadiums against the so-called "Islamification" of Europe," he said.
"In Poland where the party is very conservative and wants to enforce \'traditional values\' there have been in the last three weeks huge banners in stadiums abusing the LGBT community.
"These banners are 150 metres wide so there is an organised campaign and many clubs are turning a blind eye or a deaf ear. This is what happens when you have a political environment that creates hatred." (Reporting by Martyn Herman Editing by Christian Radnedge)


More than one million migrants from sub-Saharan Africa have made a home in Europe in the last nine years - new data has revealed.
According to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from Statista, Europe\xe2\x80\x99s statistical agency, more and more migrants from Africa have sought entry to Europe over the past decade.
The Pew Research Centre noted around 970,000\xc2\xa0sub-Saharan migrants legally moved to Europe between 2010 and 2017.
Migrants keep warm in Red Cross blankets after arriving aboard a coast guard boat at Malaga\'s harbour in June last year
The data shows that most years since 2010 have witnessed a rising inflow of sub-Saharan asylum applicants in Europe.\xc2\xa0
According to the Pew Research Centre,\xc2\xa0Sub-Saharan Africans also most commonly moved to Europe as international students and resettled refugees, through family reunification and by other means.\xc2\xa0
A poll carried out among several African nations showed that many more would move to another country if the means and opportunity arose.\xc2\xa0
And in Senegal, Ghana and Nigeria, more than a third say they actually plan to migrate in the next five years.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
In terms of destinations, as of 2017, nearly three-quarters (72%) of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s sub-Saharan immigrant population was concentrated in just four countries: the UK (1.27 million), France (980,000), Italy (370,000) and Portugal (360,000).\xc2\xa0
Between 2010 and 2017, the total number of Somalians in Europe increased by 80,000 people. Over the same period, the total population of Eritreans living in Europe climbed by about 40,000, according to UN estimates.


April 2 (Reuters) - European shares treaded water on Tuesday following their strongest two-day rally since January, as Brexit uncertainty clouded sentiment with parliament deadlocked again over its exit from the European Union.
The pan-European index was up 0.03 percent at 0720 GMT, nudging towards highs from September and March.
Most European bourses posted slight gains and Britain\'s exporter-heavy FTSE 100 rose 0.5 percent, helped by a weaker sterling.
Global equities advanced on Monday, with STOXX posting its best gain in six weeks, after investors were encouraged by upbeat manufacturing surveys out of China and the United States.
The strong data from two of the world\'s largest economies came on the heels of fresh concerns over the health of the world economy after the U.S. Federal Reserve abandoned plans for interest rates hikes this year in a surprise move last month.
Meanwhile, Britain was no nearer to resolving the chaos surrounding its exit from the EU bloc after parliament failed on Monday to find a majority of its own for any alternative to Prime Minister Theresa May\'s divorce deal.
May is due to hold five hours of cabinet meetings with senior ministers on Tuesday to plan the government\'s next moves.

A former Irish soldier who went to live in Islamic State-controlled Syria has reportedly denied fighting for the jihadist militants.
Lisa Smith, a 37-year-old originally from Co Louth, is currently living in a refugee camp in Syria.
In an interview with The Mail On Sunday, she spoke of her desire to return to Ireland with her two-year-old daughter, whom she claims was born to a British father while living in IS territory, a man she says died in the last three months.
\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, I want to go back to my country,\xe2\x80\x9d the former member of the Defence Forces told the newspaper.
\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s (daughter) my number one priority now that\xe2\x80\x99s why I want to leave and take her home with me and get her educated.
\xe2\x80\x9cPeople here are not educated.\xe2\x80\x9d
In the interview with the newspaper, she added: \xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing for me what I can do anyway is just live my life the way I live it, in my own home, with my daughter, and bring my daughter up.
\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to cause problems for anyone, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to mix, I\xe2\x80\x99m still me, I\xe2\x80\x99m still like a good neighbour, I\xe2\x80\x99m still a good friend, I\xe2\x80\x99m just still me.

\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not, like, out to kill anyone, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in suicide attacks.\xe2\x80\x9d
According to the newspaper report, when asked whether she fought for Isis, Ms Smith said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything.\xe2\x80\x9d
She reportedly added: \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t even own a gun.
\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband many times said to me, \xe2\x80\x98you want me to buy you one?\xe2\x80\x99 I said no.
\xe2\x80\x9cHe said \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s just for self-defence\xe2\x80\x99 or, I said: \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\xe2\x80\x99.
\xe2\x80\x9cI think anyone that knows me, you know in the army or outside the army or anywhere in my life, will know that, they know me, that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pick up the weapon and fight and stuff like that.
\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t own a rifle, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t teach them anything.\xe2\x80\x9d
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has already indicated that Ms Smith would be permitted to return to Ireland if she wished.
But he has said a security assessment would have to be carried to make sure she is not a threat to anyone in Ireland.
Asked if she should face investigation in Ireland, Ms Smith told The Mail On Sunday: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I should be tried.
\xe2\x80\x9cIf they want to put an investigation on me, I have nothing to hide.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing I did was come here and, if that\xe2\x80\x99s my crime, like a lot of other people\xe2\x80\x99s, for coming here and realising I made a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d

\'Leo is fundamental for us and marks the style, it is well known that he is the best in the world for something.\'


PARIS (AP) - Nimes posted a second straight win to get back in the race for a European finish with a 3-1 win over Rennes in a rescheduled French league match on Tuesday.
With seven games left to play, Nimes leapfrogged its Brittany rival into 10th place, just five points behind fifth-place Marseille.
The match at Costieres stadium had been postponed to allow Rennes sufficient time to prepare for a Europa League match it lost to Arsenal last month.
Nimes put on an excellent defensive display and was clinical with its rare chances, as Renaud Ripart, Denis Bouanga and Antonin Bobichon all scored. Nimes defender Herve Lybohy had inadvertently put the teams level in the 40th minute by putting the ball in his own net.
Tempers frayed toward the end of the first half and both teams played with 10 men after the interval as Nimes captain Anthony Briancon was sent off for a foul on Hatem Ben Arfa and his Rennes counterpart Benjamin Andre earned a second yellow card.

Ireland captain Rory Best has eased fears over his participation at the Rugby World Cup after revealing he should recover from his ankle problem before the end of the season.
Best suffered the damage to his left foot in Ulster\'s Champions Cup quarter-final defeat by Leinster on Saturday and following a scan on Monday it was confirmed he will be fit to lead Joe Schmidt\'s team into Japan 2019.
\'Probably the scan couldn\'t have been a lot better. There\'s no structural damage, just a few wrenches to some of the ligaments in there,\' Best told reporters.
Ireland captain Rory Best has eased fears over his participation at the World Cup
\'So, from that side of things, it\'s good news. It is still going to be a few weeks. They just like to put the magical figure of six weeks on it.
\'It might be less, it might be more, but it\'s in and around there. I would hope to play some part in the end of season for Ulster, which will be a big goal now.
\'Obviously that will depend on the next three games, certainly the next two games for us in terms of play-offs.\'
Best has accumulated 117 caps and has been Ireland\'s first-choice hooker since making his debut in 2015.
The 36-year-old\'s fitness will come as a relief to Schmidt after the Kiwi head coach was told on Monday that Leinster openside Dan Leavy would miss the World Cup because of a \'complex\' knee injury.

ROME, April 11 (Reuters) - A charity ship with scores of African migrants on board appealed to European states for a safe port on Thursday after being stranded for eight days between Malta and Italy, saying the health of the rescued people was worsening.
Rome and Valletta denied the Alan Kurdi ship entry into their waters after the vessel, managed by German humanitarian organization Sea-Eye, rescued 64 migrants off the Libyan coast on April 3.
Libya, where thousands of African and Syrian migrants and refugees are trapped in Tripoli as a battle for the city draws closer, is the main embarkation point for migrants attempting the perilous sea-crossing to Europe.
Two of 12 women on board the Alan Kurdi were disembarked this week by Maltese patrol boats for health reasons. One of them, a 23-year-old pregnant Nigerian, was taken away on Wednesday evening after an epileptic crisis, Sea-Eye said.
"The Alan Kurdi urgently needs a rapid, political and humanitarian solution for 62 refugees and 17 crew members, whose families are also worried", the charity said in a statement.
Italy has closed its ports to humanitarian ships since last June, when the far-right League formed a coalition government with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.
Last week League leader and deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini told Berlin to take responsibility for the boat.
EU states have been at loggerheads over migration since a spike in Mediterranean arrivals caught the bloc by surprise in 2015, stretching social and security services and fuelling support for far-right, nationalist and populist groups.
Sea arrivals have fallen from more than a million in the peak year to some 140,000 people in 2018, according to U.N. data. But political tensions around migration are still running high ahead of European Parliament elections in May.
Last month, rights groups criticised the EU for abdicating its humanitarian responsibilities after member states agreed to withdraw ships patrolling the Mediterranean for migrants.
A Sea-Eye spokeswoman said on Thursday that Germany had called in the European Commission to mediate among EU member states and find a solution, but Brussels had not achieved anything.
"We must put an end to this. It is unacceptable that one person after another has to fall ill to be able to finally get off the ship," Sea-Eye president Gorden Isler said.
On Friday Italy offered to open its ports to two woman and their children, but they refused to be split from their husbands and remained on board.
New arrivals in Italy have plummeted since Salvini took office in June, with just 551 migrants arriving so far this year, according to official data, down 92 percent on the same period in 2018 and down 98 percent on 2017.
The vast majority come from Libya, whose descent into a civil war after Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown in 2011 has allowed people-smugglers to operate with impunity. (Reporting by Angelo Amante, Editing by Gavin Jones and Catherine Evans)

ROME, April 10 (Reuters) - An unexpected rise in industrial output in February suggests Italy may already have exited the shallow recession it fell into over the second half of last year, economists said.
Industrial output rose 0.8 percent from the month before, national statistics bureau ISTAT reported earlier on Wednesday, compared with market expectations of a 0.8 percent drop.
The data consolidated a 1.9 percent surge in January and was the first time output had posted two consecutive monthly rises since June last year.
"The worst seems to be over and we have left recession behind us," Bologna-based think-tank Prometeia said in a research note.
It forecast that industrial output would rise a strong 1.5 percent in the first quarter from the previous three months, after declining in all four quarters of 2018.
Italian gross domestic product fell 0.1 percent in the third and fourth quarters of last year, putting the euro zone\'s third largest economy into what economists define as a "technical recession" of two straight quarters of declining GDP. The industrial output rebound this year, which followed four consecutive monthly falls from September to December, has been accompanied by positive data for the larger services sector.
The closely-watched IHS Markit purchasing managers index (PMI) showed services expanding in February and March, and last month\'s growth was the strongest since September.
Stripping out a decline in output of energy products in February, Barclays analyst Fabio Fois said manufacturing output in February had increased by 1.3 percent month-on-month, following a 1.4 percent gain in January.
"Together with encouraging PMIs, recent data support our forecast that Italy exited from technical recession in Q1," he said.
ISTAT will release preliminary first quarter GDP data on April 30.
The breakdown of fourth quarter data showed exports, consumer spending and investments all expanded, while the overall GDP decline was due to a sharp reduction in inventories, a component that can be particularly volatile.
Fois said he expected GDP to be flat in the first quarter, but with upside risks "especially if destocking pressures were to stabilise."
However, even if it emerges from recession Italy\'s economic prospects remain weak, as international trade tensions persist and growth slows in its main trading partner Germany.
Moreover, the slump at the end of last year has left a negative statistical carry-over for 2019, meaning that even firm quarterly growth rates would produce only a modest full-year expansion.
After a stagnant first quarter, Barclays sees growth of 0.1 percent in the second quarter and 0.2 percent in the third and fourth, leading to a full-year growth rate of zero.
On Tuesday the government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League on Tuesday slashed its forecast for full-year growth to 0.2 percent from 1.0 percent. (Writing by Gavin Jones Editing by Frances Kerry)


The Conservative Party finally admitted it will be taking part in European Parliament elections on May 23 almost three years after the Brexit vote.
In a fresh humiliation for Theresa May, her party started recruitment for candidates tonight ahead of the official calling of the elections tomorrow.
Mrs May has insisted for months she did not want Britain to take part in the EU elections and as recently as last week said she wanted to avoid it.
In her letter to EU Council President Donald Tusk on Friday, she asked for a fresh delay to Brexit that could be cut short if the deal passes in time to avoid the election.\xc2\xa0
But an email to every member of the Tory candidates list tonight said: \'Due to the current situation we will be contesting the European Elections on 23 May 2019 and the closing date for nominations is 24 April.\'
Running the national election will cost the taxpayer at least \xc2\xa3100million and force political parties to spend millions more on campaign materials.\xc2\xa0

The move will enrage Brexiteers already furious with the Prime Minister\'s handling of the Leave vote.
Sources in the hardline European Research Group told MailOnline: \'It\'s good to know that Theresa May can say bad things with certainty.
\'If it\'s set to destroy the party, she\'s firm of purpose and pushes on. Corbyn and Barnier are very, very lucky to have her.\'\xc2\xa0
David Lidington, Mrs May\'s deputy, is expected to formally trigger the process of the elections tomorrow.
He will lay an order in Parliament that will allow returning officers across the country to start the countdown to polling day, which runs on a strict timetable.\xc2\xa0
Running a national election costs around \xc2\xa3100million. Britain currently has 73 members of the European Parliament following the 2014 election, which Ukip won.

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - A Lithuanian man flying to Italy got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane: He was the only passenger on the Boeing 737-800.
Skirmantas Strimaitis, who was flying from capital Vilnius to the northern Italian city of Bergamo for a skiing holiday March 16, had the whole plane - which can usually sit up to 188 people - to himself. The only others onboard were two pilots and five crew members.
The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one.
Strimaitis told The Associated Press Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was "a once in the lifetime experience."


ROME, April 1 (Reuters) - Italy\'s unemployment rose in February to 10.7 percent from an unrevised 10.5 percent the month before, as some 14,000 jobs were lost, national statistics bureau ISTAT reported on Monday. February\'s jobless rate was the highest since October last year. However, in the December-February period, employment levels were "broadly stable" compared with the previous three months, ISTAT said. In the three month period temporary employment declined while permanent contracts increased, reversing a long-running trend which had seen employment growth for temporary jobs but permanent ones diminishing. One of the first measures of the anti-establishment government which took office in June last year was to pass measures aimed at curbing temporary hires and encouraging open-ended contracts. The so-called "dignity decree" took full effect in November. In February the youth unemployment rate, measuring job-seekers between 15 and 24 years old, edged down marginally to 32.8 percent from 32.9 percent in January. Italy\'s overall employment rate, one of the lowest in the euro zone, slipped in February to 58.6 percent from 58.7 percent in January, remaining around its highest level for more than a decade.

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - A Lithuanian man flying to Italy got a pleasant surprise when he boarded the plane: He was the only passenger on the Boeing 737-800.
Skirmantas Strimaitis, who was flying from capital Vilnius to the northern Italian city of Bergamo for a skiing holiday March 16, had the whole plane - which can usually sit up to 188 people - to himself. The only others onboard were two pilots and five crew members.
The Novaturas travel agency said it had chartered the plane to fly a group home from Italy, and to avoid flying empty, one-way tickets were sold. Only one person bought one.
Strimaitis told The Associated Press Tuesday the flight, which lasted more than two hours, was "a once in the lifetime experience."


Ilkay Gundogan believes Manchester City are too nervous and making too many mistakes in the Champions League.
The City midfielder feels City were guilty of trying too hard as they were beaten 1-0 in the first leg of their quarter-final against Tottenham on Tuesday.
The Premier League champions were undone by a late Son Heung-min goal at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, leaving them with a deficit to overturn in next week\'s return leg.
Ilkay Gundogan believes Manchester City are too nervous in big Champions League matches
After exits in the last 16 and quarter-finals in the past two seasons, transferring domestic dominance on to the European stage remains a challenge for City under Pep Guardiola.
Gundogan told Sky Deutschland: \'We were not brave enough in the game and we made a lot of simple mistakes.
\'I have the feeling we are nervous in important Champions League games. We always make the wrong decisions.
\'In these matches we always want to do something special because it means (going through to the) Champions League semi-finals. Sometimes less is more.\'
Gundogan believes City reacted badly to an early penalty miss by Sergio Aguero.
The Premier League champions were undone by a late Son Heung-min goal against Tottenham
The Argentinian was denied by Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris after City were awarded a controversial spot-kick when Danny Rose was adjudged to have handled in the box.
Gundogan thinks the game would have been much different had Aguero scored.
The 28-year-old said: \'Negative events like that always set us back far too much.
\'Had we scored from the penalty we\'d have taken Tottenham apart.
\'But instead we withdrew from the game. That must not happen to a big team. That\'s why we\'re not there yet.\'

BERLIN (AP) - A court in Germany has found a 70-year-old babysitter guilty of manslaughter for the killing of a 7-year-old boy she was looking after.
Judges at the regional court in the southwestern city of Heilbronn sentenced the woman Monday to 10 years and six months in prison.
The trained nurse, who had been the boy\'s babysitter for several years and who he called "Grandma Elisabeth," had strangled the child while he was staying the night at her home.
Judges rejected the defense lawyer\'s arguments that his client, whose full name wasn\'t released because of German privacy rules, had killed the boy by accident, though they did take into consideration that she might have been suffering from depression and been overwhelmed by stress.


DINARD, France, April 6 (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar must listen to warnings from the international community to halt his advance on Tripoli or else it will have to see what needs to be done, Italy\'s foreign minister said on Saturday.
"We have stated quite clearly what our position is," Enzo Milanesi told reporters after a G7 meeting of foreign ministers in western France.

Ryanair has become one of Europe\'s top ten polluters and the only company in that group not running coal-fired power plants.
Data from the European Commission shows that the airline is estimated to have pumped out 9.9 megatons of CO2 last year, the 10th worst.
Power plants - seven of which are German - form the rest of the line up, with the Belchatow plant in Poland takes the top spot, the second largest fossil-fuel power station on the planet, it spews an estimated 38.2 megatons of CO2.
But despite the Commission\'s evidence that Ryanair\'s emissions were up 6.9 percent, the airline\'s spokesman said: \'Ryanair is Europe\'s greenest and cleanest airline. Passengers travelling on Ryanair have the lowest CO2 emissions per km travelled than any other airline.\'

Europe\'s Transport and Environment research group (T&E) outlined how airline emissions rose 4.9 percent last year and have risen some 26.3 percent in the last five years.
The Irish airline had figures for those periods of 6.9 percent and 49 percent respectively.\xc2\xa0
T&E\'s aviation manager Andrew Murphy said: \'When it comes to climate, Ryanair is the new coal.
\'This trend will only continue until Europe realises that this undertaxed and under-regulated sector needs to be brought into line, starting with a tax on kerosene and the introduction of mandates that force airlines to switch to zero-emission jet fuel.\'
T&E say that instead of tackling the problem governments were backing a controversial UN offsetting scheme known as Corsia.
Andrew Murphy of T&E said: \'When it comes to climate, Ryanair is the new coal\' (pictured: a Ryanair jet on the runway in Malaga, Spain)
These offsetting schemes enable airlines to invest in cheaper alternatives but their projects may not come to fruition and place responsibility on a third-party.
Mr Murphy argued: \'Aviation is Europe\'s biggest climate failure. The worst thing we can do in response is to put all our hopes in an offsetting scheme that gives airlines a license to grow indefinitely.
\'But that is exactly what airlines have cooked up at the industry-dominated UN aviation agency. The time has come for a big change in Europe\'s aviation policy.


In a Facebook video Beto O\'Rourke, a Democratic 2020 US presidential hopeful, likened President Donald Trump\'s comments about immigrants to those heard during Germany\'s Third Reich
Democratic US presidential candidate Beto O\'Rourke has compared Donald Trump\'s attacks on immigrants to Nazi Germany, saying at a campaign event that similar rhetoric might have been heard during the Third Reich.
Addressing a town hall gathering in Carroll, Iowa late Thursday, O\'Rourke recalled how Trump blasted Mexican immigrants as "rapists" and referred to some people seeking to enter the country as "animals" and an "infestation."
The former congressman from Texas also pointed to other troubling Trump behavior, including his effort to ban all Muslims from entering the country, and his seeming defense of white nationalists at a deadly rally in Virginia in 2017.
"Now we would not be surprised if, in the Third Reich, other human beings were described as an infestation, as a cockroach or a pest that you would want to kill," O\'Rourke told attendees, according to video posted on his Facebook page.
"But to do that in 2017 or \'18 in the United States of America doesn\'t make sense."
In a tweet last June, Trump berated Democrats as "the problem," and said "they don\'t care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13."
Trump frequently mentions MS-13, which is a particularly brutal criminal gang operating in the United States and Central America.
O\'Rourke is polling fourth in a Democratic field of at least 17 candidates including liberal Senator Bernie Sanders, and which may soon see former vice president Joe Biden enter the race.
O\'Rourke later acknowledged the Nazi comparison that he made in front of voters.
"I compared the rhetoric that the president has employed to rhetoric that you might have heard during the Third Reich. Calling human beings an infestation is something that we might have expected to hear in Nazi Germany," O\'Rourke told reporters.
"Describing immigrants.... as rapists and criminals. Seeking to ban all Muslims, all people of one religion," he added. "What other country on the face of the planet does that kind of thing?"
O\'Rourke\'s comparisons came as US lawmakers have been embroiled in heated debates in Congress about anti-Semitism and whether socialists are Nazis.
Six million Jews were exterminated by the Nazis in Europe between 1939 and 1945.


April 5 (Reuters) - European shares were little changed on Friday as investors waited for a closely watched U.S. jobs report and trade talks between China and the United States continued.
The pan-region STOXX 600 index was up 0.1 percent at 0730 GMT, set for its best weekly rise in three weeks. Most European markets were higher, but Germany\'s tariff-sensitive DAX slipped lower.

More complications arose for a possible merger of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank. The European Central Bank will ask Deutsche Bank to raise fresh funds before it gives the go-ahead for the deal, a source told Reuters.
The demand could complicate a bid to create Europe\'s third-largest bank out of Germany\'s top two lenders, who have struggled to recover since the financial crisis.

LONDON, April 10 (Reuters) - The United States wants foreign governments to follow Germany in adopting stricter security standards for next-generation 5G networks, a U.S. cybersecurity official said on Wednesday, adding that doing so would effectively rule out the use of Chinese equipment vendors.
Germany in March set tougher criteria for vendors supplying telecoms network equipment, stopping short of singling out China\'s Huawei Technologies for special treatment and instead saying the same rules should apply to all vendors.
Speaking on a call with reporters on Wednesday, Robert Strayer, deputy assistant secretary for cyber, international communications and information policy at the U.S. State Department, said Washington approved of the German move.
"At this point we\'re looking for governments to adopt security standards like we\'re seeing in Germany," he said. "We think it was a very positive step forward in the German standards."

More than one million migrants from sub-Saharan Africa have made a home in Europe in the last nine years - new data has revealed.
According to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from Statista, Europe\xe2\x80\x99s statistical agency, more and more migrants from Africa have sought entry to Europe over the past decade.
The Pew Research Centre noted around 970,000\xc2\xa0sub-Saharan migrants legally moved to Europe between 2010 and 2017.

The data shows that most years since 2010 have witnessed a rising inflow of sub-Saharan asylum applicants in Europe.\xc2\xa0
According to the Pew Research Centre,\xc2\xa0Sub-Saharan Africans also most commonly moved to Europe as international students and resettled refugees, through family reunification and by other means.\xc2\xa0
A poll carried out among several African nations showed that many more would move to another country if the means and opportunity arose.\xc2\xa0
And in Senegal, Ghana and Nigeria, more than a third say they actually plan to migrate in the next five years.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
In terms of destinations, as of 2017, nearly three-quarters (72%) of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s sub-Saharan immigrant population was concentrated in just four countries: the UK (1.27 million), France (980,000), Italy (370,000) and Portugal (360,000).\xc2\xa0
Between 2010 and 2017, the total number of Somalians in Europe increased by 80,000 people. Over the same period, the total population of Eritreans living in Europe climbed by about 40,000, according to UN estimates.

April 2 (Reuters) - European shares were muted on Tuesday following their strongest two-day rally since January, as Brexit uncertainty clouded sentiment with Britain\'s parliament deadlocked over its exit from the European Union.
The pan-European index was little changed at 0930 GMT, hovering near highs from September. Most European bourses were mixed but Britain\'s exporter-heavy FTSE 100 was notably higher, helped by a weaker sterling.
Global equities advanced on Monday, with STOXX posting its best gain in six weeks on encouraging manufacturing surveys out of China and the United States.
The strong data from two of the world\'s largest economies followed concerns over slowing global growth that resurfaced after the U.S. Federal Reserve abandoned plans for interest rates hikes this year in a surprise move last month.
"Markets seem to be taking a breather as there\'s really not a lot on the cards today," said Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex in London.
Meanwhile, Britain was no nearer to resolving the chaos surrounding its exit from the EU bloc after parliament failed on Monday to find a majority of its own for any alternative to Prime Minister Theresa May\'s divorce deal.
May is due to hold five hours of cabinet meetings with senior ministers on Tuesday to plan the government\'s next moves.
Domestically-exposed midcap FTSE 250 and Dublin\'s ISEQ were dragged down by uncertainty over Britain\'s EU exit.
"We expect PM May will put her deal in front of MPs for a fourth time. If the government cannot break the current impasse, it will have little choice but to seek a long extension," UBS analysts wrote in a note.
Hindering the pan-region index\'s rise were declines in the telecom sector, the worst sectoral performer this year, and basic resources, which slipped after five sessions of gains.

PARIS, April 4 (Reuters) - Italy\'s Deputy Prime Minister, Matteo Salvini, on Thursday praised the collaboration with France\'s interior minister over immigration issues, in a sharp change of tone after months of acrimonious exchanges between Italy and France.
Ties between the two traditional allies had grown increasingly tense since Salvini\'s decision to close Italian ports to migrant ships last year, culminating with France briefly recalling its ambassador to Rome in February.
"On these topics, I found myself absolutely in sync with Minister (Christophe) Castaner," Salvini told reporters on the sidelines of a G7 meeting of interior ministers in Paris, citing illegal immigration and counter-terrorism in particular.
However, Salvini - leader of the far-right League party, and who is also in charge of Italy\'s interior ministry - said nationalist leader Marine Le Pen remained his main ally in France and that he would meet her in Paris on Friday.
Asked about his relationship with President Emmanuel Macron, who has vowed to fight nationalists in upcoming European parliament elections, Salvini said: "I have never met Macron. We have different histories, different interests." (Reporting by Michel Rose, Editing by Sarah White)

BRUSSELS, April 9 (Reuters) - An Italian government scheme to reimburse shareholders of failed lenders damages the credibility of European Union rules on bank rescues, a leading EU lawmaker said on Tuesday, urging Brussels to block the plan.
The government agreed a plan on Monday with investors\' associations to use taxpayers\' money to compensate the shareholders and bondholders of six small banks that went bust over the last four years.
The scheme, which needs to be turned into law and still requires a formal authorisation from the European Commission, would for the first time recognise the principle that shareholders are not aware of the risks of their investments - and could therefore claim compensations if swindled.
"This is a very problematic approach," said Markus Ferber, a German lawmaker who leads the conservative group in the EU parliament\'s economic committee.
Under the plan, investors would be compensated up to 30 percent of the purchase value of their shares, while holders of bonds of the failed banks could get back 95 percent of their investment.
Only investors with financial assets above 100,000 euros ($113,000) or annual income above 35,000 euros, would need to demonstrate that they were victims of mis-selling. The others, which Rome estimates represent 90 percent of the total, would be automatically reimbursed.
The blanket compensation scheme is justified by the widespread mis-selling that took place in Italy, said Nicolas Veron of the Brussels-based Bruegel think tank.
But "such a decision would set a very bad precedent as bondholders and shareholders could reasonably assume that this would not be a one-off decision," Ferber said, warning of the risks if investors think they can count on compensations for their losses.
Italian and EU officials have said the plan had been informally agreed with the European Commission, which is responsible for the correct application of EU rules and the prevention of illegal subsidies to firms.
A Commission spokesman reiterated on Tuesday that Brussels was "in constructive contact with the Italian authorities on the proposed measures."
EU bank rescue rules devised after the last decade\'s financial crisis were designed to make banks and their creditors financially responsible if lenders went bust, with shareholders first in line to pay up. This was meant to avoid taxpayers bailing out failing banks.
Since the bail-in rules came into force in 2016, shareholders have been all but wiped out in all bank collapses.
But shareholders of the six small Italian banks covered by the compensation scheme would now be partly compensated. Among them are also investors in two lenders from the north-eastern Veneto region - a powerbase for the co-ruling far-right League.
Ferber said the plan went against the spirit of EU rules, but acknowledged that it may not be illegal.
In extreme cases of mis-selling, Italian savers were forced to buy bank shares in exchange for mortgages, while many others were given false information about the risks of their investments. But it is unlikely that all those who could claim compensation were actually victims of mis-selling, critics say. ($1 = 0.8870 euros) (Reporting by Francesco Guarascio; Editing by Susan Fenton)


MILAN (AP) - EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Tuesday that he is "slightly concerned" over Italy\'s slowing economy, and expressed hope that the government would take action to accelerate growth.
"Italian authorities must make supplementary efforts to keep growth alive in Italy," Juncker said at a joint press conference with Premier Giuseppe Conte.
Juncker noted that when the EU approved Italy\'s controversial budget expanding social spending, the commission projected Italian growth at 1.2 percent for 2019.
Italy has since fallen into a technical recession, and various bodies have lowered growth estimates for the year, including Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which says Italy\'s economy is likely to contract 0.2 percent this year.
In its report this week, the OECD called for bold reforms to tackle low productivity as well as social and regional inequalities.
The OECD was especially critical of the basic income scheme backed by the 5-Star Movement, saying it risks weakening work incentives and creating poverty traps given the relatively high payments compared with similar schemes in other member states.

Conte said that his government this week would approve a decree "with measures that will give impulse to growth."
But he also said that the slowdown was expected, "and that is why we conceived of a budget that wants to follow expansive but responsible policies, approving measures that the country needed for too long to re-establish social equality."

What happened?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Mount Vesuvius erupted in the year AD 79, burying the cities of Pompeii, Oplontis, and Stabiae under ashes and rock fragments, and the city of Herculaneum under a mudflow.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0
Mount Vesuvius, on the west coast of Italy, is the only active volcano in continental Europe and is thought to be one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Every single resident died instantly when the southern Italian town was hit by a 500\xc2\xb0C pyroclastic hot surge.
Pyroclastic flows are a dense collection of hot gas and volcanic materials that flow down the side of an erupting volcano at high speed.
They are more dangerous than lava because they travel faster, at speeds of around 450mph (700 km/h), and at temperatures of 1,000\xc2\xb0C.
An administrator and poet called Pliny the younger watched the disaster unfold from a distance.\xc2\xa0
Letters describing what he saw were found in the 16th century.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
His writing suggests that the eruption caught the residents of Pompeii unaware.
Mount Vesuvius erupted in the year AD 79, burying the cities of Pompeii, Oplontis, and Stabiae under ashes and rock fragments, and the city of Herculaneum under a mudflow
He said that a column of smoke \'like an umbrella pine\' rose from the volcano and made the towns around it as black as night.
People ran for their lives with torches, screaming and some wept as rain of ash and pumice fell for several hours.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
While the eruption lasted for around 24 hours, the first pyroclastic surges began at midnight, causing the volcano\'s column to collapse.
An avalanche of hot ash, rock and poisonous gas rushed down the side of the volcano at 124mph (199kph), burying victims and remnants of everyday life.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
Hundreds of refugees sheltering in the vaulted arcades at the seaside in Herculaneum, clutching their jewellery and money, were killed instantly.
The Orto dei fuggiaschi (The garden of the Fugitives) shows the 13 bodies of victims who were buried by the ashes as they attempted to flee Pompeii during the 79 AD eruption of the Vesuvius volcano
As people fled Pompeii or hid in their homes, their bodies were covered by blankets of the surge.
While Pliny did not estimate how many people died, the event was said to be \'exceptional\' and the number of deaths is thought to exceed 10,000.
What have they found?
This event ended the life of the cities but at the same time preserved them until rediscovery by archaeologists nearly 1700 years later.
The excavation of Pompeii, the industrial hub of the region and Herculaneum, a small beach resort, has given unparalleled insight into Roman life.
Archaeologists are continually uncovering more from the ash-covered city.
In May archaeologists uncovered an alleyway of grand houses, with balconies left mostly intact and still in their original hues.
A plaster cast of a dog, from the House of Orpheus, Pompeii, AD 79.\xc2\xa0Around 30,000 people are believed to have died in the chaos, with bodies still being discovered to this day
Some of the balconies even had amphorae - the conical-shaped terra cotta vases that were used to hold wine and oil in ancient Roman times.
The discovery has been hailed as a \'complete novelty\' - and the Italian Culture Ministry hopes they can be restored and opened to the public.
Upper stores have seldom been found among the ruins of the ancient town, which was destroyed by an eruption of Vesuvius volcano and buried under up to six metres of ash and volcanic rubble.

LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - Germany\'s benchmark 10-year bond yield slipped to just below zero percent on Thursday, as more signs of weakness in Europe\'s biggest economy offset optimism about U.S.-China trade talks and a softer Brexit.
After notching up the biggest monthly declines in almost three years in March, German Bund yields rose at the start of April as global economic data improved and discussions between the world\'s two biggest economies on trade appeared to be making headway. Thursday saw a note of caution return.
German industrial orders fell unexpectedly in February, registering their biggest drop in more than two years, data showed.
Germany\'s leading economic institutes, meanwhile, slashed their 2019 growth forecast for Europe\'s biggest economy to 0.8 percent from 1.9 percent and warned growth could be much lower still if Britain quits the European Union with no agreement.
Germany\'s 10-year Bund yield was minus 0.008 percent . It had jumped five basis points on Wednesday, its biggest one-day rise since mid-January.
"We had argued that negative 10-year Bund yields could only be rationalised by extreme angst," said Benjamin Schroeder, ING\'s senior rates strategist. "Some of that angst has been lifted over the course of the past few days by a slew of positive headlines leaving the 10-year Bund yield around zero again."
Most euro zone bond yields were lower on the day .
In addition to optimism about U.S.-China trade negotiations, hopes of a softer British exit from the European Union have weakened the appeal of safe-haven assets.
The lower house of the British parliament on Wednesday approved legislation which would force Prime Minister Theresa May to seek a Brexit delay to prevent a departure on April 12 without a deal.
"Markets are reacting more to the more positive news on Brexit, and if we do see some conclusion here that would be bearish for bond yields," said Pooja Kumra, European rates strategist at TD Securities in London. "But we are in mixed ground because we have poor data and the focus on Brexit."
Italian bond yields jumped on reports of cuts to Italy\'s growth forecasts. Reuters reported on Wednesday Rome was likely to cut its 2019 growth estimate this month to 0.3 percent or 0.4 percent.
Focus turned to the release later of the minutes from the European Central Bank\'s March meeting -- especially for details on ECB plans to issue new cheap loans to banks and its debate about tiering interest rates. (Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe, editing by Larry King)

BRUSSELS (AP) — The Latest on Britain\'s exit from the European Union (all times local):

Groups representing manufacturers in the U.K. and across the continent have appealed to European leaders to work with Britain to avoid a divorce from the bloc without a deal.
Make UK and sister organization Ceemet issued a joint letter to heads of state and chief negotiator Michel Barnier warning of economic shock in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The groups say that while they recognize efforts have been made to address the chaos that a no-deal scenario would cause, "it must be clear that neither the EU nor the UK are ready, and as a consequence European industry is also not adequately prepared, for this cliff edge scenario."

It\'s likely to be a rough day for the embattled British leader as she pleads for a second extension until June 30, to prevent Britain\'s departure now scheduled for Friday.
Tusk has suggested an even longer delay of up to a year with conditions attached to ensure Britain does not stymie EU decision making if it remains a member.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on Brexit (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
European Council President Donald Tusk has urged European Union member states to offer the U.K. a flexible extension of up to a year to make sure the nation doesn\'t crash out of the bloc in a chaotic and costly way.
Two EU officials, who requested anonymity because they weren\'t authorized to disclose information before it was made public, said that Tusk wants a one-year "Flextention" and get it approved at next Wednesday\'s EU summit.
Such a move would mean that the U.K. needs to take part in the May 23-26 European elections, something which British Prime Minister Theresa May has long argued against.
May asked Tusk for a short extension until June 30 earlier Friday. Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU on April 12.
--By Raf Casert in Brussels
___
9:25 a.m.
Prime Minister Theresa May says Britain will make contingency plans to take part in European Parliament elections in May if no Brexit deal is reached in the interim.
She said in her letter Friday to the EU that she is making these preparations even though she believes it\'s not in Britain\'s interest or the European Union\'s interest for Britain to take part in the elections because it is a departing member state.
May says she "accepts" the EU position that if Britain hasn\'t left the 28-nation bloc by May 23, it will have a legal obligation to take part in the elections.
The prime minister says she is still hopeful of reaching a compromise agreement that could take Britain out of the EU before that time.
___
9:20 a.m.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is requesting that the deadline for her country to leave the European Union be extended until June 30.
In a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk Friday, May said that "the United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June, 2019."
EU leaders agreed late last month to prolong the Brexit date from March 29 until April 12, unless May could push their mutually agreed divorce deal through Parliament.
The Europeans would prefer that Britain don\'t take part in the May 23-26 EU elections if it is going to leave. April 12 is the last day for Britain to signal whether it will field candidates.

BRUSSELS (AP) — The Latest on Britain\'s exit from the European Union (all times local):
12:45 p.m.
The European Union\'s legislature has warned British Prime Minister Theresa May to come to the Brexit summit with clear indications on how she hopes to turn the cross-party talks with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn into a success.
The European Parliament said in a statement Wednesday that May "cannot come empty-handed."
And the legislators told the EU leaders that they have to make sure that Britain will not become obstructionist if a long extension to their departure is granted.
They said the summit "would be advised to provide the U.K. with an extension which should be appropriately framed to respect the principle of sincere cooperation."
The European Parliament will need to approve any deal May reaches with the EU to make it binding.

LONDON (AP) — The Latest on Brexit (all times local):
9:45 a.m.
European Council President Donald Tusk has urged European Union member states to offer the U.K. a flexible extension of up to a year to make sure the nation doesn\'t crash out of the bloc in a chaotic and costly way.
Two EU officials, who requested anonymity because they weren\'t authorized to disclose information before it was made public, said that Tusk wants a one-year "Flextention" and get it approved at next Wednesday\'s EU summit.
Such a move would mean that the U.K. needs to take part in the May 23-26 European elections, something which British Prime Minister Theresa May has long argued against.
May asked Tusk for a short extension until June 30 earlier Friday. Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU on April 12.

9:25 a.m.
Prime Minister Theresa May says Britain will make contingency plans to take part in European Parliament elections in May if no Brexit deal is reached in the interim.
She said in her letter Friday to the EU that she is making these preparations even though she believes it\'s not in Britain\'s interest or the European Union\'s interest for Britain to take part in the elections because it is a departing member state.
May says she "accepts" the EU position that if Britain hasn\'t left the 28-nation bloc by May 23, it will have a legal obligation to take part in the elections.
The prime minister says she is still hopeful of reaching a compromise agreement that could take Britain out of the EU before that time.

9:20 a.m.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is requesting that the deadline for her country to leave the European Union be extended until June 30.
In a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk Friday, May said that "the United Kingdom proposes that this period should end on 30 June, 2019."
EU leaders agreed late last month to prolong the Brexit date from March 29 until April 12, unless May could push their mutually agreed divorce deal through Parliament.
The Europeans would prefer that Britain don\'t take part in the May 23-26 EU elections if it is going to leave. April 12 is the last day for Britain to signal whether it will field candidates.


The Darkness Announce UK And European Tour
(hennemusic) The Darkness have announced dates for a fall tour of the UK and shows across Europe in support of their forthcoming album, "Easter Is Cancelled."
Due October 4, the band\'s sixth record marks the follow-up to 2017\'s "Pinewood Smile", which was a Top 10 project in their native UK. An 18-show UK and Ireland trek will begin in Belfast on November 26 and wrap up with a December 20 gig in London before the group takes a break for the seasonal holidays; they\'ll return to live action for a month-long series of European concerts that will begin in Strasbourg, France on January 25.
"Easter Is Cancelled sees the four maestros embark upon their most ambitious quest to date with their musical opus soon to be thrust into the ear canals of rock fans around the globe, and a tour that will quite literally resurrect the souls of all who attend," says the band. "Join The Darkness in their mission to take back control from the fools and liars who purport to lead us, and instead march forwards into the sunlit uplands of inclusivity, togetherness and rock\'n\'roll fellowship."
