like the few other pinpricks of light scattered throughout the movie the trattoria is a vestige of a resilient communal spirit that has survived despite conspicuous neglect and abuse something has been gnawing on the bones of this place and it isn t long before garrone introduces a possible suspect simone edoardo pesce a former boxer who still keeps his fists up simone is the local bully he doesn t seem to have a job beyond an occasional heist his only apparent interest is brutalizing anyone who gets in his way for some reason he tends to gravitate to marcello or at least to the snorts of cocaine that the little man eagerly procures for him it s a worrisome relationship something has got to give and garrone teases this volcanic threat for much of the movie simone is a brute a monster with bared teeth but much like the slavering ferocious looking dog that enters barking in the opening shot and which marcello gently soothes into submission simone seems containable and for a long while marcello manages to keep him and his violence in check mostly he just goes along with simone s persistent demands an acquiescence that shapes the episodic narrative as marcello unhappily takes the wheel during a robbery tags along to a dance club and reluctantly joins simone on a cocaine run garrone likes big bold graphically precise images that grab the eye and do the work that s often done by dialogue in other movies the snarling dog announces simone who in turn embodies an unchecked malignancy simone it s clear is terrible yet there s nothing that he does including beating others to a pulp that is as horrific as the scene in which marcello sits with neighborhood men who discuss having simone assassinated one has recently been assaulted by him others soon will be seated at their usual trattoria table the men seem so calm sober and as they discuss their problem and a potential remedy you see how easily rationalized violence turns a group into a mob social realism in a symbolist key dogman is at times more pleasurable to look at than to experience because it s so deterministic and because there s so little ordinary feeling beyond marcello s uncomplicated love for his daughter neighbors and dogs garrone is a virtuoso of pain and terror which can be overwhelming despite the flourishes of comedy he also likes to go loud and he consistently pushes into hyperbole as when he comically emphasizes the difference between marcello s size and a much larger dog he grooms the contrast is funny but what makes the image linger isn t how it fits into the movie s controlling metaphor but the everyday gentleness of one creature tending to another  the first time i picked up the italian writer elsa morante s 1957 novel arturo s island in this new translation by ann goldstein the gifted translator of elena ferrante s novels into english i put it down after 75 pages morante s vision is so baroque and her prose so operatic that after reading her i needed some alone time with cucumber slices over my eyelids arturo s island is about a semi orphaned boy s coming of age on the island of procida in the bay of naples in the years just before world war ii the book s themes incest misogyny narcissism homosexuality slide across the pages like lava morante delivers epic emotions her people don t talk so much as they exclaim with a contemptuous sneer or a loud haughty cry of derision they tremble with violent disgusts and savage attitudes they strike poses of fear loathing and in the words of one character aggressive insolent vehemence they rattle the cutlery and they rattle each other arturo s island kept calling out to me however it had set its brutal hooks before i picked it up again i found lily tuck s slim and sophisticated biography of morante woman of rome 2008 reading it is an experience i recommend morante led a striding unconventional life a life that helps put the soaring cadenzas of feeling in her novels in context  rome the italian language does not want for colorful insults there are curses upon a person s dead relatives ample anatomical exclamations and countless ways to call someone a moron but these days it seems one of the biggest put downs of all is to call someone a do gooder and on the lips of matteo salvini the leader of the anti immigrant league party and italy s most powerful politician the word buonista or do gooder is a dangerous weapon the european dream is being buried by the bureaucrats the do gooders and the bankers who are governing europe for too much time mr salvini said this past week at the introduction of a new alliance of far right and populist parties before european parliamentary elections in may or early this year when he spoke scornfully of the hotshot do gooders those he equates with hypocritical limousine liberals or pollyannish bleeding hearts who condemned to death thousands by urging migrants to come come come  milan alessandro mahmoud recently won a prestigious italian song contest with his italian language rap tune money tinged with a middle eastern flavor the lyrics recall how his egyptian father drank champagne during ramadan or beckoned him home from the playground with calls of waladi habibi ta aleena arabic for my son my love come here but it turns out that italy s interior minister matteo salvini was not a fan of the song mahmood meh the most beautiful italian song mr salvini wrote on twitter following the result last month soon after a member of his anti immigrant league party proposed a law to limit foreign songs on the radio since then mr mahmoud whose stage name is mahmood has been thrust into the center of a national debate about what it means to be italian at a time when critics say the country s most powerful politician seems intent on stoking racism and xenophobia not only against new migrants but also legal immigrants who have lived in italy for years to that mr mahmoud a 26 year old of sardinian and egyptian ancestry

there fewer games but also they are shorter and quicker 10 as opposed to 12 minute quarters and with fewer play stoppages mandated by television and even if the quality of play in italy is inferior

several years in the n b a won the m v p award of the coppa italia when he was playing for sassari in sardinia in 2014 the coppa allows teams from smaller markets and smaller budgets like sassari and cremona more famous for stradivarius violins than hoops to pull off march madness like upsets against more glamorous squads like milan which is sponsored by giorgio armani and takes full advantage of the lack of a league salary cap in last year s coppa milan was one of three top seeds that lost in the first round much to the delight of fans from smaller market teams like cantù which plays in the milanese suburb of desio as one team official told me it doesn t hurt that coaches have built in salary incentives if their team does well at the midseason tournament and sponsors of course love the

courts a man who stabbed his wife to death was sentenced to a reduced term of 16 years in prison by a judge who cited the killer s anger and desperation profound disappointment and resentment over the victim s relationship with another man the judge s reasoning was made public on wednesday the friday before that as italy s highest court rejected an appeals court s decision to clear two men of rape charges it emerged that the judges in the previous appeal had doubted the accuser s account in part because they considered her too masculine to have made an attractive victim the men will now face a retrial both cases which involved female judges provoked angry comments about entrenched gender stereotypes in italy according to the national institute for statistics violence against women is

minister matteo salvini celebrated parliament s passage of his security decree to crack down on illegal immigration by assuring his supporters last year that i won t stop but stopping mr salvini is exactly what leoluca orlando the mayor of palermo the sicilian capital wants to do passed with much fanfare late last year mr salvini s security decree was intended to make italy more unwelcoming to migrants not least by doing away with two years of humanitarian protection for asylum seekers a status that allowed them to live in the country legally far from adding to security says mr orlando 71 a veteran mayor and constitutional law professor who came to prominence in the fight against the mafia the law risks pushing migrants into the shadows and the criminal underworld by denying them legal status as well as access to health care and other social services  rome italy resisted the entreaties and warnings of its european union and american allies on saturday by officially joining china s vast new silk road at a signing ceremony with president xi jinping of china a move that crystallized shifting geopolitical balances and the populist italian government s willingness to break with its traditional partners the agreement will build a better relationship between china and italy prime minister giuseppe conte of italy said italy became the first of the group of 7 nations that once dominated the global economy to take part in china s one belt one road project which makes enormous infrastructure investments to move chinese goods and resources throughout asia africa and europe the trump administration which tried and failed to stop the deal focused in the days leading up to mr xi s visit on blocking any italian use of 5g wireless networks developed by the chinese electronics giant huawei which washington warned could be used by beijing to spy on communications networks  rome president xi jinping of china arrived on friday at rome s presidential palace with a cavalry escort usually reserved for royals for a three day visit italy pulled out all the stops for an economic superpower promising billions in investment and trade deals in exchange for officially signing on to china s vast new silk road but even as mr xi and his wife were serenaded at a state dinner by andrea bocelli the leaders of france germany and the european union huddled in brussels hoping to strengthen the continent s defenses against what they considered to be china s economic incursion the disconnect between the two scenes laid bare the divisions and tensions in europe caught in the middle of a trade war between the united states and china while trying to find its bearings and assert its power in a volatile era of shifting geopolitical alliances and american retrenchment china plays on our divisions president emmanuel macron of france speaking in brussels told reporters on friday adding that the european union had finally woken up to china the period of european naïveté is over  the united states in fact sought to stop italy s joining of the silk road this week secretary of state mike pompeo said he was saddened by the development on thursday luigi di maio italy s deputy prime minister and the political leader of the five star movement met with national security adviser john r bolton at the white house mr di maio told reporters that he assured the americans that the china deal was purely about commerce and that italy remained firmly in the political orbit of the united states which has vastly more money invested in the country than china does in the months before the deal mr di maio repeatedly visited china and nearly made a deal in november italian officials said all along the italians said they heard barely a peep from top officials in the united states and by the time mr bolton s spokesman went public against the deal earlier this month it was too late a senior government official speaking on background to discuss internal deliberations said washington would have engaged sooner if it had understood that italy planned to officially join the new silk road which it sees as a strategic threat the official said the chaotic nature of italian politics and the fact that visits to beijing had become the norm for european leaders made it harder to discern what the italians were up to indeed already 16 central and eastern european countries including 11 members of the european union have formal business relations with china the chinese have essentially bought the port of piraeus outside athens the new deal will now also allow it access to critical italian ports like genoa and another in trieste which has a rail link reaching right into the heart of central europe  rome around 300 children in bologna italy were not eligible to attend kindergarten this week because a temporary measure relaxing vaccination requirements expired and a previous stricter law returned to force dozens of other children across italy were also likely to be affected said mario rusconi president of the association of head teachers and senior staff in lazio rome s region a 2017 law made 10 vaccines obligatory for children who enrolled in italian schools a response to a worrisome decline in vaccinations nationwide and a measles outbreak that same year but last year the health ministry headed by a member of the five star movement one of the parties in the coalition government adopted a temporary measure to allow children to stay in school as long as their parents attested they had been vaccinated a doctor s note was not needed  the italian economy shrank 0 2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with the third quarter istat the italian statistics agency said it was the second quarter in a row of declining output and that by one common definition means a recession it is italy s third since 2008 growth in the eurozone itself was just 0 2 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter the european union statistics agency said that rate matched the previous quarter s and anemic as it is it might have been worse but for spain and france spain s economy grew at an unexpectedly strong clip rising 0 7 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the third and in france where the government has been struggling with mass public protests over economic duress growth hit 0 3 percent economists agree with mr conte on one point that china s woes are weighing on europe during the last decade europe profited from china s push to modernize its infrastructure china equals the united states as a customer for heavy duty german machinery like cranes textile machines or equipment for steel mills and companies like volkswagen have made the country a priority it s our biggest market said ralph wiechers chief economist at the mechanical engineering industry association which represents german machine manufacturers we still have growth but we are noticing a lack of momentum critics of the italian government blame its economic policies at home for its performance economists say the populist alliance has sowed uncertainty prompting many italians to spend less a decline in consumer spending was a major culprit in the economy s setback carlo cottarelli a former director of the international monetary fund who led a spending review of the previous italian government reviewed the statistics on thursday and said the alliance in power since june was responsible for italy s slide this recession here it can t be the fault of the previous government he told a radio

growing strength died on feb 16 at his home in manhattan he was 91 his daughter nina gardner said the cause was congestive heart failure while his profile was probably highest when he was posted to rome dr gardner was also an adviser to democratic presidential candidates and a distinguished law professor at columbia university one candidate he advised was jimmy carter who on becoming president in 1977 appointed dr gardner to the rome post until then american officials had long supported italy s christian democrats who dominated politics there and kept the door closed to leftist parties it was the height of the cold war and washington was worried about communist influence in western europe especially in france and italy  bags inspired by a designer s coming of age each time i visit my

first published in 1945 the book is levi s memorable account of life among impoverished italian villagers in the 1930s three decades later an immersive and engaging film adaptation directed by francesco rosi enshrined the book s underlying neorealist credo giving voice to the voiceless originally made for italian television as a 220 minute mini series rosi s christ stopped at eboli was shown in the united states in 1980 at approximately half its length and under the title eboli considering the significance of the book and the stature of the director the american theatrical premiere of the full version now at film forum is an event levi a painter doctor and man of letters in his native turin was forced into exile in the southern hinterlands as a punishment for his anti fascist activities in the mid 1930s as italy prepared to invade ethiopia he was sent to a small town he calls gagliano his account of his yearlong stay there was written years later in florence while he was hiding from the gestapo the book s title comes from a local saying about gagliano s isolation eboli is the last station on the train from the north not even christ cared to venture this far south christ stopped at eboli was published the year world war ii ended at the same time roberto rossellini s rome open city heralded a new naturalistic italian cinema and like that movie levi s memoir was an international success a front page essay in the new york times book review described it as sui generis by turns a diary an album of sketches a novelette a sociological study and a political essay rosi gives eboli a more straightforward narrative juxtaposing everyday fascism with gagliano s archaic ways a populist historical pageant where modernity meets the medieval ages  the court noted that at the time she was accused of killing ms kercher a briton ms knox had been particularly vulnerable being a foreign young woman 20 at the time not having been in italy for very long and not being fluent in italian her statements during the interrogation had been taken in an atmosphere of intense psychological pressure the court said the case made headlines for years in italy the united states and britain during her interrogation in 2007 ms knox accused her boss a pub manager of killing ms kercher but he was subsequently exonerated a court later found that she had committed slander and the european court decision concerned the process leading to that conviction on thursday ms knox who is 31 now and lives in seattle wrote on her blog that she had spent years wracked with guilt over those statements i signed in the interrogation room ms knox her boyfriend at the time of the killing raffaele sollecito and a third man rudy guede were found guilty of ms kercher s murder in 2009 but in 2015 italy s highest court not only overturned the conviction of mr sollecito and ms knox who had served four years in prison it took the rare step of fully exonerating them mr guede is still serving a 16 year sentence in lodging her complaint with the european court in 2013 ms knox said she had not been assisted by a lawyer during the all night interrogation and had not been provided with a professional interpreter she also claimed to have been subjected to extreme psychological pressure an allegation the court would determine was unfounded  rome when he was prime minister of italy matteo renzi fighting desperately to win a referendum on which he had staked his job thought that one particular rally had gone well he was surprised then to discover that rt the international russian television network with close ties to the kremlin that was formerly known as russia today had mischaracterized the pro renzi event on oct 29 2016 as protests against the italian prime minister ahead of the referendum on the constitution mr renzi s opponents quickly latched on to the report and shared it widely on social media prompting the italian leader to express his displeasure directly to vladimir v putin the russian president does it seem reasonable to you that russia today often uses headlines that are not true he asked mr putin in a phone call why do they have to have reports today on some protest against me if that square is full of my people defending our reform  china a country the size of a small continent tends to leverage its heft by negotiating with other states one on one rather than through regional blocs it has put this technique to use with asean the southeast asian association using bilateral deals to divide members judging by the tone of president xi jinping s visit to italy and france over the past week china has adopted the same approach in europe this time pitting the italian government which is anti european union against the pro e u french government of emmanuel macron among others as expected italy signed a wide ranging memorandum of understanding or m o u with china becoming the first major western economy to endorse beijing s colossal and controversial one belt one road infrastructure initiative most contentious perhaps was the italian government s decision to grant a chinese state owned company access to two ports including one used by the united states navy that is just 100 kilometers from nato s largest air base in the mediterranean region but did mr xi really get out of italy what he came for since june 2018 when the awkward motley coalition formed by the populist five star movement and the extreme right anti immigration league came to power the italian government has been as triumphalist as its politics have been amateurish and confused the same goes for its recent dealings with mr xi essential terms of the m o u and of the 29 contracts signed along with it which range from the frivolous to the reckless are exceedingly vague in fact some commitments are inherently noncommittal  frankfurt the european central bank took control of a troubled italian bank wednesday an unprecedented step that spotlighted the risks to the eurozone s financial system from political chaos in rome and a sputtering economy while the bank banca carige is a midsize lender its fate has the potential to reverberate broadly among policymakers and economists looking for signs of the next crisis italy and its heavily indebted banks have been a source of concern for years and the policies and statements of the populist government in rome have recently added to the woes of italy s banks and by extension the whole economy it s not a bank large enough to cause systemic crisis said lorenzo codogno a former chief economist at italy s treasury who operates lc macro advisors a consultancy in london but he added we have seen that even small banks can cause huge problems the current government is not prepared for a full fledged banking crisis mr codogno said the action by europe s central bank on wednesday reassured investors so far that the vulnerabilities of banca carige the 10th largest lender in italy would not provoke a broader crisis  washington highly indebted italy must gradually consolidate public finances and boost productivity the head of the international monetary fund s european department poul thomsen said on friday itay has the second highest public debt in europe at more than 130 percent of gdp but its populist government is planning more social spending despite growth coming almost to a halt we believe it is critical that italy adopts a medium term package of gradual fiscal consolidation gradual measures gradual consolidation thomsen told a news briefing we believe that if these are good measures credible measures even in the short run they might not have a significantly negative if any impact on growth he said  milan politics is a show and every country has its favorite the united

what about italy it s a music festival of course the italian song festival festival della canzone italiana is held annually in sanremo a quaint seaside resort near the french border and is by far the most popular television event of the year this year it will be broadcast live between feb 5 and feb 9 held since 1951 it is used for picking the italian entry to the eurovision song contest and today it attracts more than 12 million viewers more than half of the country s tv audience it combines a song contest with some comedy and a few handsomely paid international guests advertisers scramble to squeeze their products into five days of prime time broadcasts but sanremo as it is known is far more than a song contest it s a national gathering like the academy awards in the united states it s a truce in quarrelsome times it s predictable and reassuring the young like to trash it live on social media but they too watch it and talk about little else for days that is why i ve accepted an invitation to join the festival s giuria degli esperti experts jury which includes writers actors and film directors sanremo s organizers didn t know i was planning to write about them of course but

government just like the previous ones is mismanaging immigration this time allowing a a farce by leaving 50 asylum seekers at sea for 19 days they were finally brought to shore the same day by the maltese coast guard and will be distributed across nine european union nations  paris it has happened rarely between european union allies and not between france and italy since world war ii but on thursday after months of barbed commentary from italian leaders the french government said it had had enough it recalled its ambassador from rome this is without precedent since 1940 when mussolini declared war said marc lazar a specialist in franco italian relations who teaches at universities in paris and rome this is very very harsh there s never been anything comparable the protest not only demonstrated the breakdown of relations between france and italy founding members of the european union it also reflected the mounting strains at europe s core brought on by populists seeking to denigrate the bloc and forge anti european alliances across borders a clash that may play out even more bitterly in european parliament elections in may but now that the populists run the italian government europe s divided politics have been elevated to the level of diplomatic rancor  caio mussolini 51 was a naval officer for 15 years then an executive in italy s largest defense contractor finmeccanica before turning to politics he is a professional a serviceman a patriot meloni said against the backdrop of the multi arched facade of the palace of italian civilization that was built by benito mussolini and known to modern day romans as the squared colosseum standing beside meloni caio mussolini who is running in southern italy called it an honor to run for brothers of italy which he described as patriotic like i am in an interview with the right wing paper libero caio mussolini conceded that his name is not an easy one to carry but that he will never be ashamed of my family asked if he would define himself as a fascist he responded fascism died with benito mussolini he added that he was born well after that period and that fascism was now something for historians to study

was sold to the public through the italian stock exchange far from winning through connections as five star politicians have claimed the benettons easily beat out the lone rival bid led by an australian bank which sought a mere 10 percent of the company there simply was not much interest in autostrade scholars say largely because the regulatory framework looked daunting the ministry of infrastructure and transport had clear control over both inspections and toll rates at least on paper any investor would have been worried about bidding said carlo scarpa a professor of economics at the university of brescia in northern italy the benettons though knew the system and they understood that the ministry of infrastructure and transport which was supposed to supervise the whole thing was weak they were able to calculate the weight the company would have in the political arena italy was so desperate for cash that it was ready to strike a deal on very generous terms there were price

apparently in a defection attempt according to a south korean lawmaker briefed by intelligence officials the potentially embarrassing news for kim jong un north korea s leader came just two days after he extolled his country s economic and diplomatic progress and delivered an implied threat that if international sanctions against the north continued he would have no choice but to return to nuclear confrontation little is known about what happened to cho seong gil who had been north korea s acting ambassador to italy since october 2017 if his defection is confirmed he would be the highest

the anti migrant league party shares them on his many social media feeds just about every day but mr salvini s social media feeds are not really about product placement or the musings of a proud

migration and an emphasis on traditional national identities europe s far right populists also disagree on many points of policy mr salvini s german and scandinavian partners lean toward free market economics while their french allies are more protectionist mr salvini has argued repeatedly that other european union members must take their fair share of migrants but some countries like hungary have slammed the door shut and poland does not share the warmth that mr salvini and other populists have toward russia on monday mr salvini rejected the suggestion that he and his allies were extremists and said they all had a clear memory of what happened in the past but the tired debate of left and right fascists communists that s not what we are passionate about or what 500 million european citizens are passionate about the debate on the past we will leave to the historians for mr salvini the european elections could affect his standing at home as well as across the continent a strong showing in may would help him consolidate power in italy s governing coalition where he is technically a junior partner to the anti establishment five star movement which has hemorrhaged support since the election in march 2018 but his italian allies are less than pleased with his international project on monday mr salvini s struggling coalition partner luigi di maio the five star leader wrote an open letter to corriere della sera italy s leading newspaper arguing that ahead of the european elections in may he found it paradoxical that mr salvini was seeking a formal alliance

ferrante fever is as its title suggests less about elena ferrante the enigmatic pseudonymous italian writer whose neapolitan novels have enthralled readers around the world and more about the author as a literary phenomenon it s an anodyne fan flick that casts only furtive glances in ferrante s direction as if the filmmaker giacomo durzi were a reverential subject who doesn t dare to make eye contact with the queen his approach is worshipful decorous and therefore strikingly incongruous with the layered ambivalent genius that his film pays tribute to a novelist who has made a point to excavate the darker recesses of a woman s experience ever mindful of what ferrante has called her deliberate absence durzi has opted to have writers editors and other cultural figures explain what it

most famous being the anna g corkscrew a whimsical tool with a feminine shape that he said was inspired by anna gili a friend and fellow designer i remembered as a child when my grandmother would open a bottle of wine at the table it always seemed like a good performance a kind of ritual ballet the turning of the head the arms moving up and down the sound of the cork popping from the bottle he told

disturbing connection between the industrialization of killing and the mass production of moving pictures depictions of combat and slaughter excised from narrative or political context as they are here also lose their moral and aesthetic bearings the spectacles that thrill us and the documentary evidence that horrifies us are hard to tell apart are we looking at cruelty or heroism fact or fiction justice or barbarism and if those distinctions collapse what about the narrower but to godard utterly vital distinction between cinema as an art and the ubiquitous and disposable images that threaten to swallow it and us no answers are forthcoming and those are far from the only questions this film provokes further research is suggested by an implied syllabus that includes texts by victor hugo and montesquieu and films by among many others nicholas ray roberto rossellini ridley scott abderrahmane sissako and godard himself what you remember may not be pictures or ideas so much as his voice roughened by age and tobacco fragile but still hectoring melancholy and indomitable reaching the end of his ninth decade on earth and his sixth behind the camera godard resembles his near contemporary clint eastwood who similarly perseveres without regard for the vicissitudes of fashion or reputation they still make movies because they still know how to take issue with either man s

for young designers who come to public attention by starting their own labels with a few friends and even fewer funds and then get snapped up by heritage names with big budgets reputations and

leather goods brand salvatore ferragamo to be creative director across all collections for the luxury house his purview will extend to men s wear and brand image strategy at a critical juncture for the business ferragamo which in recent years has struggled to gain online visibility and win over younger luxury shoppers and has recently been subject to takeover speculation is in the midst of a major restructuring effort the demands of the new job will require mr andrew to effectively relocate to italy from new york his long time home base and the headquarters of paul andrew the namesake footwear line he started in 2012 though he won the council of fashion designers of america vogue fashion fund prize in 2014 on the strength of his label and as of january it was stocked by more than 100 wholesale partners he chose to hit the pause button his 2019 spring summer collection will be the last one shipped to stores and sold online for now and excess stock will be donated to charity it wasn t the easiest decision by any means mr andrew said by telephone from new york it wasn t as if business was bad and i have worked very hard to build the paul andrew brand into what it is today but

italian luxury house of which sartori is now artistic director got its start his father designed mechanical looms while his mother ran a tailoring shop i remember being just 3 or 4 and watching in awe as she altered wedding dresses and winter coats he says being surrounded by sketches and patterns and fittings has always felt like my most natural habitat as a teenager in the late 80s he studied textile engineering and joined zegna soon after working first as a product designer and later as the director of the brand s sporty z zegna diffusion line following a hiatus at berluti he returned to the fourth generation family owned company in 2016 in his current role and began deconstructing the rigid traditional dress codes to which it had long adhered the new generation doesn t want the same old stiff suit their father wore they want a totally personalized silhouette says the designer 52 nowadays you mostly see formal suiting at funerals and in court instead sartori champions technical

thursday whether the driver described as being between 25 and 40 years old struck mr cali s vehicle to lure him outside or whether the two men knew one another the bloody attack in some ways did not bear the hallmarks of hits from the past mafia hit men once considered it taboo to kill a rival at his home near his family it was also unusual in previous eras for a single gunman rather than a team to execute a high ranking mobster and yet even against its serene setting on hilltop terrace with its stately homes circular driveways and swimming pools the image of mr cali s body lying on the street was a throwback to the black and white photographs of mafia assassinations past todt hill a getaway from the bustling city offers privacy that has appealed to mob bosses the last time the boss of a mafia family was assassinated was in 1985 the former gambino boss paul castellano was gunned down outside sparks steak house in midtown a power grab orchestrated by a young mr gotti who ran the family through the late 1980s in his trademark showy style mr cali rose quickly through the ranks of the family becoming a made member in the late 1990s on the way to a swift promotion to acting captain in less than 10 years a prosecutor joey lipton said at a 2008 detention hearing after mr cali s arrest in an extortion case in federal district court in brooklyn mr lipton said mr cali had familial and blood ties to the gambino family tracing back to sicily his wife rosaria inzerillo had several relatives associated with the gambino family including her cousin tommy gambino court papers from that hearing said mr cali started out in a crew under a rising captain john d d amico known as jackie the nose who became the acting boss of the family around 2005  aboard the papal plane pope francis putting president trump on notice warned on sunday that those who close borders will become prisoners of the walls that they build the remarks came as the pope was returning from a visit to morocco where he worked to further his priorities of supporting migrants and establishing closer relations between the roman catholic church and moderate islam mr trump threatened friday to seal off the border with mexico and moved to cut aid to guatemala honduras and el salvador to punish them for failing to stop a surge in migrant crossings into the united states francis who suggested in 2016 that mr trump was not christian for his belief in building walls rather than bridges was also asked aboard the papal airplane about the spanish government s efforts to keep out migrants many of whom depart from morocco  mr tajani has apologized several times but he also insists that he was misinterpreted and that it was not his intention to make territorial claims i was referring to the istrian and dalmatian italian language exiles their children and grandchildren he said in one of his apologies he was referring to italians who were forced from the regions after italy surrendered to allied forces at the end of world war ii mr tajani who has refused to resign declined a request for an interview after the end of world war ii ethnic italians living in the coastal areas of istria and dalmatia even those who had called those areas home for centuries were viewed as collaborators with fascist italy most were either expelled or killed some were thrown into deep limestone caves and pits that dot the adriatic coast many people in italy refer to the mass killings simply as foibe or caves a joint italian slovenian historical committee estimated that as many as 4 000 ethnic italians were killed in italy for the past 20 to 25 years there has been a reinterpretation of their history especially as it concerns rijeka and istria said franko dota a croatian historian rijeka is a city in croatia during the cold war the issue of territories was not discussed especially when it was associated to fascism and the fact that italy was on the wrong side of history mr dota said after the cold war it became easier for nationalist historians to promote a different interpretation of what they saw as injustices perpetrated against italians in these areas but that narrative mr dota and others say ignores the oppression endured by slovenians and croatians when italy controlled their territory the experience people remember most from this period is that of italian fascist expansionism which many know as a period of repression over the slovene and croat population he said  one significant restoration of the cartoon was carried out in 1797 78 at the louvre in paris where it ended up along with other works after napoleon s troops swept through northern italy in 1796 since 1966 it has been on display in its own room at the pinacoteca but it was set back behind a guardrail in the new arrangement visitors can walk directly up to vitrine made by the italian display case experts goppion who claim it is the largest single door vitrine in the world five years ago the cartoon came under the scrutiny of a fresh crop of scholars and restorers who were concerned about its state of conservation funded through a private donation the restoration took four years because of its complex nature and required various stages of intervention said the chief restorer maurizio michelozzi it might have taken time but it served to provide a better understanding of the masterpiece mr michelozzi said  the art of the argentine italian modernist lucio fontana looks like it comes from another planet and it might as well given how seldom we see it in new york the exhibition lucio fontana on the threshold at the met breuer with spillovers at the met fifth avenue and el museo del barrio is the artist s first museum survey here in more than 40 years this wouldn t be especially notable plenty of his latin american peers never get seen at all were fontana who died in 1968 not so influential a figure the threshold of the title refers not only to the early phase of his career which the show highlights but also to his position as a forebear of contemporary art as we know it things we take for granted installation new media and the poly disciplinary impulse that defines so many 21st century careers fontana pioneered in the 1950s part of the reception problem lies precisely in his breadth when an artist toggles between figurative sculpture and television art where do you land then there s the pretty ugly look of the work some of it is just weird as hell painting surfaces are punched or slashed through or ooze as if with eruptive disease some of his ceramic sculptures suggest fecal deposits others pods swollen with alien life his colors can be crazy screaming pink bruisy blue pictures in one series are all starchy white those in another glint with chunks of colored glass embedded like jewels on reliquaries  i had stumbled across william s work at the mudd club in the early 1980s when some photos on the wall stopped me they were portraits of musicians from the neighborhood some of them my friends taken in the present but with a formal tone of the past i asked the bartender who made them and he said the artist william coupon lived just a couple of blocks away i met william and saw more of his images which were beautiful he was an artist who wanted to capture the beauty of people in social groups and he saw the local musicians who played at the club as a community a contemporary tribe that feeling also informs his photos from cafe tal where echoes of the past linger fat carmine aquilino tells stories about the old neighborhood photos on the wall so does joe perrotta the cafe s owner recently he pointed to a 50 year old photograph of men playing cards around a table in the same room we were in that s my father mr perrotta said that it s not only

from niger one of the cruelest experiences of his quest for safety occurred this week within sight of the southern shores of europe from the deck of the sea watch 3 a rescue ship owned and run by a small german charity mr soumana could see the white cliffs of malta gleaming in the sunlight and even the outlines of seaside buildings the german crew members could reach that coast within 45 minutes by speedboat not mr soumana he was one of 49 migrants stranded aboard a pair of rescue ships whose requests for safe harbor had been ignored or refused by every national government bordering the mediterranean sea since their rescue in december until malta agreed on wednesday to let them come ashore we are crying mr soumana said in an interview on the boat this week before malta announced the move we can see malta with our own eyes but we are still stuck on this ship  in sweden working mothers i spoke with wanted full gender equality and expected to seamlessly combine paid work and child rearing mothers there also anticipated that the government would support them in these endeavors and that s exactly what the swedish state its work family policy and the country s cultural ideals about work and motherhood do when swedish mothers feel stressed they tend to blame the country s lofty expectations of what parenting should be german mothers ascribed their work family juggling act with its emphasis on traditional home life to outdated cultural ideals american women who worked for companies that provided flexible schedules and paid maternity leave described themselves as being very lucky or feeling privileged this privatized approach taken by the united states government and employers exacerbates inequalities among workers some elite employers elect to offer helpful work family policies meaning only certain workers typically highly educated salaried employees receive these supports the employees most in need of support however vulnerable hourly wage workers are the ones least likely to enjoy any work family benefits the highest income earners in the united states are 3 5 times as likely to have access to paid family leave as those at the bottom of the pay scale after three months of interviews with mothers in sweden i was heartened to discover that the country in many ways lives up to its image as the place where women come closest to having successful careers and fulfilling family lives but consider the national policy focus responsible for that lifestyle sweden prizes gender equality universal child care and a dual earner carer model that features women and men sharing breadwinning and child rearing roles women in stockholm seemed confused or laughed out loud when i used the term working mother i don t think that expression exists in swedish an urban planner and mother of two told me it s not like there s a nonworking mother she said i mean what else would she do but we can t simply import social policies and hope they ll have the same effect in a different context for instance american parents tend to marvel at germany s comparatively luxurious sounding three year parental leave which was available to new parents for decades so i was taken aback when many working mothers in germany told me they despised the policy because of the cultural stigma it heaped on their shoulders to not return to work until they absolutely had to a teacher who went back to work before the end of the allowable parental leave described people telling her you cannot do this you are selfish you re a career whore balance is a term that came up relentlessly in my conversations with women in the united states but framing work family conflict as a problem of imbalance is merely an individualized way to justify a nation of mothers engulfed in stress it fails to recognize how institutions contribute to this anxiety the stress that american parents feel is an urgent political issue so the solution must be political as well we have a social responsibility to solve work family conflict let s start with paid parental leave and high quality affordable child care as national priorities  ms merkel herself has been a source of disappointment for mr macron her natural caution has been cold water to his impassioned plans for european reform especially for the countries that use the common euro currency most of his lofty visions like a shared eurozone budget have been watered down or have come to nothing but ms merkel also wants to support him and his commitment to europe especially when he is in difficulty at home each leader acknowledged the challenges but drew on them as reasons for the new treaty seventy four years after the end of world war ii a lifetime things considered self evident are again being called into question ms merkel said in remarks before the signing that is why we need first a re establishment of the responsibility of germany and france within the european union and second a reorientation of our cooperation the new accord includes pledges to deepen economic integration through a joint economic zone and to reinforce cooperation in military purchasing and coordination with the aim of improving europe s ability to act on its own it includes a mutual defense pact within the context of nato membership and would establish a joint defense and security council both mr macron and ms merkel have called in their own ways for a european army capable of acting alone when nato does not wish to be involved both have also said that europe can no longer count on the united states as it has in the past that idea created anger and concern in washington and set off a series of contemptuous remarks over twitter from president trump europe is the protective shield for our people against the new storms in the world mr macron said  this year marks the quincentennial of the death of leonardo da vinci the italian renaissance master who died in may 1519 to celebrate the prodigious

from the face of mount amiata a volcanic peak in southern tuscany with a purplish blue cast the 20 bedroom castle thought to have been built on etruscan foundations dating to the fourth century b c was all that remained of an 11th century bulwark with medieval walls encircling a central stone paved courtyard such a mythic site was a siren song to horton and her family members a bohemian tribe reminiscent of the british expatriates in italy gently teased by e m forster in a room with a view intrepid culturally voracious and joyously out of bounds so one summer day she and her half brother alexander greene now 40 joined their mother sally a former ballerina and photographer and horton s stepfather graham c greene a guinness heir and nephew of the novelist who was once the managing director of the publishing house jonathan cape and chairman of the british museum to explore what remained of the fabled house the untrammeled corner of southern tuscany was not unfamiliar to them nor was exploring a bedraggled historic estate although their main residence was in london where horton 55 had started out as an editorial assistant at vogue developing a personal style that fused punk with flamboyant neo romanticism an yves saint laurent bomber jacket atop a cut silk velvet 1930s evening gown for example the greenes had in 1989 bought montepò an imposing ramshackle castle on a thousand acre estate 35 miles away which they transformed into a thriving winery they sold it to a scion of the biondi santi family creators of brunello wines in 1999 still mount amiata had nothing of

it was no local fun run or 5k i decided to run the biggest road race there was the boston marathon i had no idea if i could finish the 26 2 mile grind but i thought i should at least give myself a big challenge i chose boston in part because i didn t know any better and mostly because the world of running was very different back then there were few runners and fewer races only a handful of marathons across the country back then boston did not require runners to meet a qualifying standard i was 34 and to run boston you only had to send the race organizers 2 and a physician s letter stating that you were healthy enough to run 26 2 miles since my longest training run had been 13 miles i m not sure how my doctor established my readiness but he did i had begun running less than a year earlier in april 1968 i was a part of a small group that started new york magazine in a fourth floor walk up on 32nd street with writers such as tom wolfe jimmy breslin and gloria steinem  china

administration at the munich security conference in mid february vice president mike pence ordered european union governments to withdraw from the iranian nuclear deal and stop undermining american sanctions which also penalize european companies french and british defense officials were incensed when america whom they had followed into syria decided unilaterally to withdraw its troops while asking the french to stay behind and at a tense discussion about european defense behind closed doors a senior american diplomat speaking with a grant of anonymity from reporters in order to allow frankness sternly lectured west european participants for not being sensitive to the united states and to president trump then came warnings against choosing the giant chinese tech company huawei to develop fifth generation 5g wireless networks and threats by richard grenell the american ambassador to germany of retaliation involving restrictions on intelligence sharing gordon sondland the united states ambassador to the european union warned of retaliation if brussels limits the involvement of american companies in european military projects mr trump threatened europe with severe economic

indirectly related to a nigerian oil deal that occurred in 2011 a spokeswoman for the dutch prosecutor s office valentine hoen said that based on the investigation so far we concluded there are prosecutable offenses however she said inquires were continuing and no decision had been made on what if any actions would follow a trial in the netherlands would mark a significant expansion of the

new zealand said he drew inspiration from white extremist terrorism attacks in norway the united states italy sweden and the united kingdom his references to those attacks placed him in an informal global network of white extremists whose violent attacks are occurring with greater frequency in the west an analysis by the new york times of recent terrorism attacks found that at least a third of white extremist killers since 2011 were inspired by others who perpetrated similar attacks professed a reverence for them or showed an interest in their tactics the connections between the killers

and at least four other white extremists was anders behring breivik the far right extremist who killed 77 in a bombing and mass shooting in norway in 2011 mr breivik s lengthy manifesto offered a litany of grievances about immigration and islam and the attacks became a model for future ones i think that breivik was a turning point because he was sort of a proof of concept as to how much an individual actor could accomplish said j m berger author of the book extremism and a research fellow with vox pol a european academic initiative to study online extremism he killed so many people at one time operating by himself it really set a new bar for what one person can do shortly after the norway massacre a prominent american white supremacist named frazier glenn miller wrote on a white supremacist forum that mr breivik had inspired young aryan men to action mr miller opened fire on a jewish retirement home and community center in kansas a few years later killing three mr breivik was not the only mass killer to inspire copycats the christchurch shooter also paid tribute to a canadian man who opened fire inside a quebec city mosque in 2017 writing his name on one of the guns used in his attack that canadian gunman read extensively about dylann roof the american who killed nine worshipers at a black church in south carolina in 2015 at least four white extremist killers made statements online praising elliot rodger a racist and misogynist who targeted women in a 2014 spree before carrying out their own attacks all these attacks occurred amid a surge of white supremacist and xenophobic terrorism in the west that has frequently targeted muslims immigrants and other minority groups the times analysis found the rise in white extremist terrorism attacks in europe north america and australia a large share of attacks in 2015 targeted migrants in europe 135 88 65 22 16 12 9 2011 2013 2015 2017 the analysis was based on data from the global terrorism database and identified nearly 350 white extremist terrorism attacks in europe north america and australia from 2011 through 2017 the latest year of available data we also examined preliminary data on attacks in the united states in 2018 the database is a project of the national consortium for the study of terrorism and responses to terrorism at the university of maryland it relies on news reports and other records to capture episodes that meet its definition of terrorism the use of violence by a non state actor to attain a political or social goal over this period white extremism an umbrella term encompassing white nationalist white supremacist neo nazi xenophobic anti muslim and anti semitic ideologies accounted for about 8 percent of all attacks in these regions and about a third of those in the united states erin miller who manages the database said the increase in white extremist terrorism parallels a rise in hate crimes and bias episodes in the west and that deadly attacks are occurring more often there s a common framing of far right terrorism or domestic terrorism as being terrorism lite and not as serious she said it s an interesting question given that far right attacks can be quite devastating xenophobia drives violence in europe in recent years europe has seen a surge in far right and xenophobic violence amid an influx of migrants and refugees from conflicts in the

least 38 attacks that targeted places of worship like churches synagogues and mosques across north america mosques and other islamic institutions other places of worship until last year the deadliest of these attacks in the united states were a shooting at a sikh temple in wisconsin in 2012 and a shooting at a black church in south carolina in 2015 online radicalization an attacker who voiced his hatred of women and people of color in a manifesto before killing six people in california in 2014 signaled a new type of terrorist the southern poverty law center which monitors hate groups called the attacker the first alt right killer several more attackers who fit this profile killed over the next few years rising violence then in 2017 attacks jumped in a tense post election political environment nine of these proved deadly deadly attacks other attacks in 2017 preliminary 2018 data for the united states shows five additional deadly white extremist attacks including mass shootings at high schools in florida and texas and at a pittsburgh synagogue deadly attacks mail bombing attempts other attacks in 2018 the global reach of white extremism there were five white extremist attacks in australia from 2011 through 2017 all of which were attacks on mosques and islamic centers there were no such attacks in new zealand during that same period then the massacre of worshippers at two mosques in christchurch on march 15 the deadliest shooting in modern new zealand history helped put the global nature of white extremism into relief the shooter was an australian man who said he was radicalized during his travels in europe and designed his attack to draw an american audience experts say the same broad motives are at play whether the target is a mosque in perth or an asylum seekers shelter in dresden or a synagogue in pittsburgh attackers who identify as white christian and culturally european see an attack on their privileged position in the west by immigrants muslims and other religious and racial minorities the difference now is that it is easier than ever for extremists to connect both domestically and across continents according to mr berger the extremism author the entry point for radicalization is less narrow than it was during earlier waves of white supremacist action when finding ideological fellow travelers typically required meeting in person this is a particularly strong wave mr berger said and i think it s being fueled by a lot of political developments and also by the sort of connective tissue that you get from the internet that wasn t there before that s really making it easier for groups to be influenced and to coordinate or not necessarily coordinate but synchronize over large geographical distances heidi beirich director of the southern poverty law center s intelligence project said that given these international connections it s important to reconsider the nature of the threat we conceive of this problem as being a domestic one she said but that s not the case the challenge for law enforcement will be to buck a sometimes myopic focus on islamic extremism as the only driver of international terrorism it may also require rethinking the legal framework for what constitutes terrorism from violence that arises from a command and control structure to a looser definition that can account for a wider range of violent actors who share a common ideology they don t see themselves as americans or canadians very much like the christchurch killer didn t see himself as an australian he saw himself as part of a white collective dr beirich said it has never been the case that these people didn t think in a global way they may have acted in ways that looked domestic but the thinking was always about building an international
