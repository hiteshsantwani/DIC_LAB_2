jörg meuthen a leader of the far right alternative for germany party or afd said at the news conference that there were absent partners who will join us soon immediately after the elections in may he said the allied parties will form a new group in the european parliament called the european alliance of peoples and nations the result of numerous meetings over recent months olli kotro a member of the finns party who attended the event was more cautious saying it remains to be seen who will join us while they share common ground when it comes to strong borders against migration and an emphasis on traditional national identities europe s far right populists also disagree on many points of policy mr salvini s german and scandinavian partners lean toward free market economics while their french allies are more protectionist mr salvini has argued repeatedly that other european union members must take their fair share of migrants but some countries like hungary have slammed the door shut and poland does not share the warmth that mr salvini and other populists have toward russia on monday mr salvini rejected the suggestion that he and his allies were extremists and said they all had a clear memory of what happened in the past but the tired debate of left and right fascists communists that s not what we are passionate about or what 500 million european citizens are passionate about the debate on the past we will leave to the historians for mr salvini the european elections could affect his standing at home as well as across the continent a strong showing in may would help him consolidate power in italy s governing coalition where he is technically a junior partner to the anti establishment five star movement which has hemorrhaged support since the election in march 2018 but his italian allies are less than pleased with his international project on monday mr salvini s struggling coalition partner luigi di maio the five star leader wrote an open letter to corriere della sera italy s leading newspaper arguing that ahead of the european elections in may he found it paradoxical that mr salvini was seeking a formal alliance with those countries who refuse to accept

other online platforms profiting from their content without compensating them adequately on tuesday the media industry got some help with the european parliament s adoption of a copyright law that requires technology platforms to sign licensing agreements with musicians authors and news publishers in order to post their work online the new law is meant to force tech firms to aggressively remove unlicensed copyrighted material from their websites proactively rather than waiting for complaints to come in before acting the vote followed one of the most intense lobbying campaigns in years over a european union law digital rights activists and tech industry representatives who opposed the law said it would result in censorship while limiting the sharing of information the measure s supporters said it would protect europe s creative industries and force companies to pay for the content they share online  even the weather seemed to conspire against europe an unusually dry and hot summer caused the water level in the rhine river to drop so low that barge traffic became impossible disrupting transport of chemicals and fuel causing shortages and driving up prices the timing of the overseas slowdown could not be worse from the united states perspective it s happening just as the american economy is expected to slow down after the economic high of the tax cuts that went into effect last year starts to wear off in that environment the united states and its companies will be more dependent on the health of trading partners like europe the u s needs the rest of the world a bit more than last year said brad w setser a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations economic weakness abroad can also send american stock markets into a tailspin in 2011 when investors feared that a wave of european governments and companies might default on their debts american stocks fell nearly 20 percent from their highs in 2015 the s p 500 plunged after china s central bank made a surprise move that reduced the value of the country s currency against the dollar the sudden announcement by the european central bank on thursday was out of character typically the bank changes policy gradually and gives investors plenty of warning the bank also displayed an unusually high level of determination and unity all of the members of the governing council supported the decisions on thursday mr draghi said that has not always been the case during the crisis years the council which includes central bankers from all 19 countries in the eurozone was often divided on its response still the central bank is treading cautiously waiting to see what happens with the economy it did not take the more radical step of increasing its purchases of government and corporate bonds

consumer confusion greenpeace humane society international and other groups wrote in a letter dated april 1 on the contrary consumers purchase these items because they do not contain meat or dairy the proposal must still pass the full european parliament which will not take it up until after elections in may it would then have to be negotiated and agreed on by the council of ministers before becoming law according to neil corlett a european parliament spokesman whether the proposal is a maneuver by the meat lobby or simply an attempt by the french to assert food traditions the proposal reflected a certain defensiveness by the meat industry as more and more people reduce their meat consumption ms scott cato said there was no consumer demand for this she said adding that she would continue to oppose the amendment as an attempt by the meat industry to make life harder for people who prefer vegetarian diets in the united states there has been a push by the dairy industry to require the food and drug administration to enforce labeling rules for milk as more americans switch to alternative milks which come from any number of plants pea milk anyone nobody thinks their almond milk comes from a cow said michele simon the executive director of the plant based foods association in san francisco as for efforts in some states to come up with labeling for plant based meat substitutes there was no confusion there either she said people are happily buying these products not thinking they are beef she said  lohheide germany on a former cold war base german and dutch

is an important baby step toward deeper european military cooperation first floated after world war ii the idea of a european army is as old as the european union itself but has yet to become a reality now though the idea has taken on new urgency because of the trump administration s threat to withdraw the continent s security guarantee if it does not spend more on its defense at a high level security conference last weekend the breach between the united states and europe burst into the open leaving many european officials feeling increasingly on their own  munich european leaders have long been alarmed that president trump s words and twitter messages could undo a trans atlantic alliance that had grown stronger over seven decades they had clung to the hope that those ties would bear up under the strain but in the last few days of a prestigious annual security conference in munich the rift between europe and the trump administration became open angry and concrete diplomats and analysts say a senior german official who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak on such matters shrugged his shoulders and said no one any longer believes that trump cares about the views or interests of the allies it s broken the most immediate danger diplomats and intelligence officials warned is that the trans atlantic fissures now risk being exploited by russia and china  china uses a different approach under the guise of the concept of a new silk road with its echoes of marco polo president xi wants to connect europe to china economically this has meant buying the port of athens and some other crucial gates to southern europe greece was desperate for money germany could see no wrong the new silk road now more prosaically described as the belt and road initiative has also involved setting up an organization called 16 1 16 european former communist states 11 of them european union members plus china to kindly help them build infrastructure in two years i have had six bilateral meetings with my chinese counterpart the prime minister of one small european union country in the 16 1 said need i say more more daringly the highlight of mr xi s visit to italy a founding member of the european union was the signing on saturday of a memorandum of understanding to endorse the belt and road initiative project no longer content with the periphery china is aiming for the heart of europe with newfound tenacity when washington and brussels expressed their displeasure with his move on italy beijing doubled down the united states supposedly europe s greatest ally has its own fight with china a big fight over trade that has already slowed economic growth in europe and over technological dominance in a normal world washington would have enrolled its european allies in its fight but this is not a normal world president trump s america treats europe either as a competitor or as a vassal not a week has passed without new bullying from the trump administration at the munich security conference in mid february vice president mike pence ordered european union governments to withdraw from the iranian nuclear deal and stop undermining american sanctions which also penalize european companies french and british defense officials were incensed when america whom they had followed into syria decided unilaterally to withdraw its troops while asking the french to stay behind and at a tense discussion about european defense behind closed doors a senior american diplomat speaking with a grant of anonymity from reporters in order to allow frankness sternly lectured west european participants for not being sensitive to the united states and to president trump then came warnings against choosing the giant chinese tech company huawei to develop fifth generation 5g wireless networks and threats by richard grenell the american ambassador to germany of retaliation involving restrictions on intelligence sharing gordon sondland the united states ambassador to the european union warned of retaliation if brussels limits the involvement of american companies in european military projects mr trump threatened europe with severe economic pain if no progress was made in delicate trade talks soon enough reports came out of washington that mr trump wants to bill european countries for the deployment of american troops plus 50 percent for the privilege of hosting them according to bloomberg news  brussels after britain voted to leave the european union in june 2016 its leaders were in a panic the bloc was mired in a migration crisis and anti europe populist forces were gaining britain s decision seemed to herald the start of a great unraveling two years later as britain s exit from the bloc or brexit looks increasingly messy and self destructive there is a growing sense even in the populist corners of the continent that if this is what leaving looks like no thank you nothing has brought the european union together quite as much as britain s chaotic breakdown a country is leaving and has gotten itself into a right old mess making itself ridiculous to its european partners said rosa balfour a senior fellow at the german marshall fund in brussels the challenges facing europe low growth eurozone governance migration debt border security and populism have by no means gone away nor has europe found consensus on how to deal with them  but interviews with over a dozen workers revealed a deep seated disillusionment with the recovery and the quality of jobs emerging from it the changes in labor laws weakened job protections as well as earnings with millions looking for work employers could offer lower salaries making it harder for people to regain or maintain living standards mrs navarro and her husband were among the better off with degrees in law management and business she owned the events promotion company employing around 50 people on and off for projects in 2006 some of her clients suddenly stopped paying two years later as the financial crisis hit she had to close shop she found a managerial job at a nonprofit foundation that paid 2 500 a month less than before but enough to help maintain the family s lifestyle then the foundation went under in 2012 the same year the labor legislation went into force mrs navarro could not find a new job because the foundation had required her to register as self employed a tactic that allows employers to avoid paying high social taxes she received no unemployment compensation her husband lost his job the same year and collected unemployment benefits as he looked for work he eventually took over a charcuterie stand once owned by mrs navarro s father in a dimly lit produce market becoming self employed but his sales are down because other spaniards too are economizing mr alvarez now earns 1 000 a month but after taxes and social security takes home only about a third of that  warsaw in budapest this week secretary of state mike pompeo warned bluntly of security threats from russia and china but he did not overtly criticize the assault on liberal democracy by prime minister viktor orban of hungary who has systematically stripped the courts media and academia of their independence and in warsaw this week vice president mike pence spoke out against iran but had no harsh words for poland the first european union member to face possible sanctions from the bloc for weakening democracy and the rule of law instead he praised poland still shaken by the killing of a leading opposition politician last month as a bastion of freedom in central europe the trips by mr pompeo and mr pence made it clear that the erosion of democratic values and institutions in eastern and central europe does not rank high on the trump administration s agenda just as striking two years into president trump s term is that no one was at all surprised we know very well that the trump administration is not interested in this topic said roman kuzniar a professor at warsaw university and a foreign policy adviser to poland s former president bronislaw komorowski they are coming from a different planet from the moon they are not a part of the global pro democratic movement  michele geraci an italian economic development minister who is running the negotiations with beijing said in an interview that chinese ships carrying materials from home or its vast network of interests in africa through the suez canal simply needed to get their goods to central european markets as quickly as possible trieste meets that requirement swiftly he said italian officials say their american counterparts initially seemed disinterested in the deal deputy prime minister luigi di maio the leader of the five star movement has made several trips to china in recent months nearly signing the accord during a november visit to beijing they said after the fact american diplomats began making their case but the italians said the deal was noticeably not on the american radar during recent high level meetings in washington but this month garrett marquis spokesman for the american national security adviser john r bolton sharply attacked the deal in a twitter post and in several interviews while the national security council s official twitter account also issued a reproach on march 9 endorsing bri lends legitimacy to china s predatory approach to investment and will bring no benefits to the italian people the tweet stated referring to the belt and road initiative the americans have also tried to pressure leaders of the nationalist league party which is part of the governing coalition in italy this month trump administration officials and separately the former white house official stephen k bannon met with party leaders mr bannon said that he had warned his italian allies in the league against what he called china s british east india company model of predatory capitalism  dubrovnik croatia china s prime minister promised friday that his government will respect european standards and fair trade seeking to allay concerns that it is flouting european union competition rules with huge investments on the continent opening an annual summit between eastern and central european nations and china li keqiang said we intend to fully respect european standards the chinese government has also been criticized for failing to give reciprocal access for european companies to chinese markets we welcome openness and we want to treat all companies that operate in china equally and to increase imports from the european countries he said through an interpreter china is open to the world we welcome the two way openness  the story to counter the populist narrative should start like this there is no invasion migration is controllable and must be controlled but that is not enough how migrant flows are managed and reduced matters too populists say they will stop everyone principled politicians must instead say we will control our borders humanely we will not stop everyone but we will discourage those with no claim to protection from setting out and send back those who come we will respect human rights and refugee law we will welcome the persecuted we will rescue those adrift at sea we will work with and invest in neighboring countries like turkey to expand the space in which refugees can live and be returned to in dignity and we will offer migrants the opportunity to come and work regularly in proportion to our needs and capacity they don t just need to say these things they also need to show that they are doing them they need policies that match their story much touted european values are at the heart of this story they are important they are popular they are what distinguish democrats from demagogues and they are for the most part conspicuously absent from the practices europe has employed to reduce the pressure on its borders this in the end is the crucial question how do governments deliver humane effective border control the honest answer must be with difficulty at cost and through significant administrative and some legislative reforms it is possible however and necessary the broad outlines are already clear a coalition of willing european governments should come together to ensure quick but fair processing of all asylum applications in reception centers in frontier states and to return those with no claim to protection to their countries of origin for this they reach agreements with these countries that speak to their actual interests where possible they return refugees to transit countries willing to receive them but only if their rights are fully respected there which requires investment and monitoring finally they distribute recognized refugees from these centers across other participating european union states mainstream european politicians and parties should endorse such a plan immediately and then begin figuring out the details that will be hard work but less costly and less dangerous than not coming up with a plan doing nothing or doing many things ineffectively is not going to convince voters and certainly won t win back

keep the neighbor out ms vallet said fortress europe much like the desert terrain along the united states border with mexico the perilous seas not walls have been the main obstacle for people trying to get to europe the continent has gone beyond building walls to impede the arrival of undocumented migrants frontex the european union s border agency and national governments raised a security apparatus that is often referred to as fortress europe it includes naval patrols and surveillance on the mediterranean where most migrants try to cross into europe european governments work with countries like libya morocco and turkey to try to deter migrants from attempting deadly sea crossings last year an estimated 150 000 illegal crossings were detected on the external borders of the european union according to frontex the same person may attempt the crossing and be counted in different locations this was 25 percent less than in 2017 and the lowest level in five years still far

than specific actions by the company she highlighted china s history of hacking and stealing trade secrets its poor record on human rights and internet censorship and chinese cybersecurity rules that

shared strategy on iran climate change trade israel palestine etc and making a mockery of shared values through his embrace of autocrats from pyongyang to riyadh words like dialogue and cooperation are not part of trump s conception of alliances the alliances therefore erode europeans are not where lavrov and russia want them to be thirsting to build a shared european house from lisbon to

american convened conference on middle east security to lash out at washington s three closest european allies on thursday accusing them of trying to break american sanctions against iran s murderous revolutionary regime mr pence delivered his critique of the allies britain france and germany in an address at a warsaw conference organized by the trump administration it was a remarkable open breach with the european nations that along with the united states had negotiated the 2015 nuclear accord all three nations argued that president trump made a grave error in abandoning the treaty last year saying that the iranians were in compliance even as they continued to conduct missile and space rocket tests that were not covered by the accord to the europeans it is mr trump not the iranians who was the first to break the agreement s terms since then they have been trying to persuade the iranians to continue to comply with the deal under which tehran gave up 97 percent of its nuclear material and agreed not to produce any significant quantities of nuclear fuel until 2030 american intelligence agencies told congress late last month that the iranians were still in compliance  twenty years

few believe that things will be any better post brexit mr o rawe worried that a new visible dividing line on the island would revive ancient division and anger a hard border would cement the injustice that has been historically perpetrated against the irish people he said it would be presented as the british government asserting a warped definition of democracy in ireland to suit their own agenda and would energize the adage that britain only respects one thing the barrel of a gun in the 2016 brexit referendum a majority of people in northern ireland 55 8 percent voted to remain in the european union this means that it would be dragged out of the union against its will and in particular against the will of its irish nationalists support for independence and a reunification with the

control a border that separates a european union country from a nonunion country mrs may s brexit plan leaves open the possibility of at least customs checks along the border without a plan in place a hard border will almost certainly be needed mr o rawe believes that the british government preoccupied with political strife in westminster has given no thought to what brexit might bring in terms of

their vehicles with inferior emissions equipment european authorities said friday a finding that could expose volkswagen daimler and bmw to a large share of the blame for poor air quality in europe

millions of vehicles in europe and the united states with software designed to dupe emissions testers if the finding published friday is confirmed the carmakers could face billions of euros in fines the latest accusation against the carmakers is in many ways even broader than volkswagen s cheating the commission said that for most of a decade volkswagen daimler and bmw had agreed not to compete on key components of their pollution controls violating antitrust laws and contributing to bad air quality in traffic clogged cities like london and paris instead the carmakers colluded to restrict

major political transformation have never been particularly easy for jews and the current moment is no exception anti semitism is ascendant in europe and many fear that the resurgence of nationalism will exacerbate it but there is a twist anti semitism s rise in europe is being accompanied by a growing fascination among europe s hard right with israel and in particular its prime minister benjamin netanyahu this captivation is particularly acute among the governing national populist parties in central europe a region where anti semitism has historically found fertile ground central european leaders view mr netanyahu as a close ally last year the visegrad group an organization for cooperation between central european countries announced plans to hold a meeting in israel its first outside

improving europe s ability to act on its own it includes a mutual defense pact within the context of nato membership and would establish a joint defense and security council both mr macron and ms merkel have called in their own ways for a european army capable of acting alone when nato does not wish to be involved both have also said that europe can no longer count on the united states as it

newer far more authoritarian allies in central europe mr pence and secretary of state mike pompeo spent the week visiting several of them in a european tour that bore little resemblance to similar trips taken by administrations past the contrast is between a new foreign policy that focuses on america first and expects others to do as we say no matter what said ivo daalder a former american ambassador to nato and now the president of the chicago council on global affairs and the old foreign policy of working together in pursuit of common values mr pence did acknowledge significant progress in getting more nato members to live up to their commitment to contribute 2 percent of their gross domestic product to defense by 2024 even the current secretary general of the nato alliance jens stoltenberg of norway said on saturday that european allies are stepping up more for defense but mr pence went further he repeated a call that he made in warsaw on thursday during an american led conference of foreign ministers chiefly from arab and european states that britain france and germany withdraw from the 2015 nuclear accord with iran it was a demand they had no intention of complying with as chancellor angela merkel of germany made clear in an impassioned defense of alliances and europe s approach to iran that preceded mr pence s speech by only moments  brussels as diplomatic spats go it was a spring shower in a teapot not even a minor tempest but european feelings were badly bruised last year when the trump administration downgraded the diplomatic status of the european union s delegation to the united states without making a formal announcement or even informing the bloc about the change the permanent reversal of that decision was announced on monday with the ambassador of the european union to the united states now again considered to be equivalent to an ambassador from a country not just to an envoy from an international organization the announcement was made with some fanfare by the american ambassador to the european union gordon sondland whom european diplomats credit with pushing hard for the fix in a statement mr sondland called the bloc a uniquely important organization and one of america s most valuable partners in ensuring global security and prosperity president trump has called the european union a foe in economic competition with the united states but mr sondland said that europe s security and success are inextricably linked to that of the united states and this level of engagement and cooperation should be recognized appropriately in all settings  london with britain s fate in the hands of the european union it wants to leave prime minister theresa may shuttled between berlin and paris on tuesday to plead for more time to salvage her faltering withdrawal plans european leaders have indicated that they are willing to push back the date for britain s withdrawal from the bloc most likely until the end of the year but they are insisting that mrs may explain how she would put that time to constructive use that may be complicated for the prime minister back home her parliament is deadlocked over withdrawal the political parties are split and talks between the government and the opposition on a compromise plan are making minimal progress so ahead of a summit meeting in brussels on wednesday at which european union leaders will decide what to do mrs may embarked on some last minute diplomacy her goal was to reduce the risk of the summit ending in a no deal brexit on april 12 the current deadline which could have serious economic consequences  rome pope francis defended modern multilateral diplomacy and international institutions against the resurgence of nationalistic tendencies in an address at the vatican on monday francis did not cite specific countries in his speech delivered to diplomats at the holy see but he appeared to be lamenting the mix of jingoism and isolationism that has emerged in the united states and in european nations where populist governments have risen to power noting that the league of nations established after world war i had failed to head off another war largely because countries were not willing to work together francis raised the specter of fresh violence the same attitudes are presently threatening the stability of the major international organizations he said urging europeans in particular to remain united in the face of temptation to erect new curtains  white house officials on friday said the united states would begin withdrawal from a landmark 1987 nuclear arms control pact with russia asserting the russians have violated it for years the decision suspends american obligations under the treaty and terminates the accord unless russia comes into compliance within six months but with russia asserting it is complying the outlook for preserving the treaty regarded as one of the most important in the history of preventing nuclear war is bleak here is a look at the origins of the accord known as the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty and the possible impact of its demise what is the i n f treaty and how did it come about the treaty resolved a crisis of the 1980s when the soviet union deployed a missile in europe called the ss 20 capable of carrying three nuclear warheads the united states responded with cruise and pershing ii missiles based in europe   they continue to give themselves an unfair advantage at every turn daniel ek spotify s chief executive said in a message posted on the company s website he said apple was

vowed to find a way to enable tehran to keep doing business with the rest of the world after months of delay and after enduring mockery from the trump administration three major european allies on thursday finally introduced a financial mechanism to do just that the question now is whether anyone will actually use it the new company called instex for instrument in support of trade exchanges would essentially allow goods to be bartered between iranian companies and foreign ones without direct financial transactions or using the dollar by avoiding the american banking system and currency the hope is that european companies and others will feel confident that they can do business with iran without being subject to the sanctions the european countries britain france and germany were all signatories to the iran deal in 2015 as was the united states under president barack obama the europeans along with russia and china who were also signatories have all vowed to keep to the terms of the agreement which was intended to ensure that iran could not build a nuclear weapon  munich chancellor angela merkel of germany delivered a strong rejoinder on saturday to american demands that european allies pull out of the iran nuclear deal and gave a spirited defense of multilateral institutions in a world increasingly marked by great power rivalry in an uncharacteristically passionate speech ms merkel said the nuclear deal was the best way of influencing iranian behavior on a range of non nuclear issues from missile development to terrorism without mentioning president trump or the united states by name in what may be her last speech to this major security conference ms merkel criticized other unilateral moves such as mr trump s decision to pull american troops out of syria a suggestion that he would withdraw quickly from afghanistan and his decision to suspend the intermediate range missile treaty with russia which directly affects european security we sit there in the middle with the result she said ms merkel spoke immediately before the united states vice president mike pence and addressed a packed auditorium with an audience that included mr trump s daughter ivanka as well as the russian foreign minister and a high ranking chinese official who all pointedly remained seated when the chancellor received a standing ovation  london pep guardiola clasped his hands to his head a look of sheer exasperation on his face even that though did not feel sufficient not after one of his players had given the ball away so carelessly and so the manchester city manager hurled himself to the ground curled over in his cable knit sweater and beat the turf with his fists by the time he had picked himself up the danger had passed but that was not the point guardiola seeks perfection there are times when he takes anything less as a personal slight he frantically waved to the culprit ilkay gündogan to grab his attention in the tumult of the tottenham hotspur stadium on tuesday he had to resort to mime two hands palms flat raised what exactly was that two fingers pointed to the temples think watching guardiola on the touchline is exhausting few managers seem to become so absorbed in a game so consumed by it he moves constantly restlessly pacing and jittering and signaling bellowing instructions and calling players over for brief conclaves and turning on his heel to consult with his bench after a while once the movements are decoded it is almost possible to tell how manchester city is playing simply by watching guardiola a cross between a telegraph service and an interpretive dance troupe   i d like to imagine that it will end because a lot of families are waiting said veronika pugachova 37 a history teacher whose husband is serving on the front she worries about him not least because her brother in law also a soldier was killed in the conflict in 2015 i try to believe that when there s a new government in some way all of these issues will be dealt with ms pugachova said we re all patriots and i m very proud of my husband she said of course it s hard it s hard to wait because when he leaves it s not for less than six months of course it s hard we believe in him we support him our whole family does in this election mr poroshenko is seeking a second five year term if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote on

statistics agency said it was the second quarter in a row of declining output and that by one common definition means a recession it is italy s third since 2008 growth in the eurozone itself was just 0 2 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter the european union statistics agency said that rate matched the previous quarter s and anemic as it is it might have been worse but for spain and france spain s economy grew at an unexpectedly strong clip rising 0 7 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the third and in france where the government has been struggling with mass public protests over economic duress growth hit 0 3 percent economists agree with mr conte on one point that china s woes are weighing on europe during the last decade europe profited from china s push to modernize its infrastructure china equals the united states as a customer for heavy duty german machinery like cranes textile machines or equipment for steel mills and companies like volkswagen have made the country a priority it s our biggest market said ralph wiechers chief economist at the mechanical engineering industry association which represents german machine manufacturers we still have growth but we are noticing a lack of momentum critics of the italian government blame its economic policies at home for its performance economists say the populist alliance has sowed uncertainty prompting many italians to spend less a decline in consumer spending was a major culprit in the economy s setback carlo cottarelli a former director of the international monetary fund who led a spending review of the previous italian government reviewed the statistics on thursday and said the alliance in power since june was responsible for italy s slide this recession here it can t be the fault of the previous government he told a radio station in padua  both camps though were weakened by internal division the cairo based arab league has been reduced to little more than a talking

omar hassan al bashir of sudan who is wanted by the international criminal court on genocide charges from attending saudi arabia was represented by king salman 83 on his first foreign trip in 16 months an interval that heightened speculation that his health or his mental capacities were declining those suspicions intensified during the king s address to the summit when he lost his place in his text fumbling for 16 seconds and asking an aide about what he had already read according to a live broadcast of the remarks he continued as the other delegations sat stone faced but fumbled again a minute later mr el sisi though visibly basked in the spotlight of his diplomatic triumph one newspaper on monday featured a full length photo of mr el sisi surrounded by european and arab leaders in a speech on sunday he warned that terrorism was spreading like a cursed plague his counterterrorism tactics are under heightened scrutiny since the execution on wednesday of nine people convicted of the killing of hisham barakat egypt s chief prosecutor in a bomb attack in 2015 human rights groups said the men s confessions had been extracted under torture and their trials were deeply flawed mr el sisi defended the executions on monday when a human being is killed in a terrorist act the families tell me that we want the right of our children and their blood he told reporters this culture exists in the region and that right must be given through the law  mr diagne she is someone who stands her ground and that is the case for felwine also i spoke to them often as they were writing the report they consulted widely they traveled back and forth to senegal mali cameroon and they spoke with people in the president s office who gave them legal advice the biggest surprise even shock of the savoy sarr report is that it explicitly says that only full restitution of works of art will be acceptable curators have dodged this debate before by pointing to france s centuries old inalienability law national institutions do not have the right to deaccession anything in a public collection savoy and sarr say no the law has to change it is the only morally responsible thing to do ms fromont that s why the report is potentially so impactful it demands that the logic of france s relationship to africa be renegotiated it s not simply about the objects and where they are by insisting on full restitution the idea of long term loans to african countries becomes as absurd as it sounds ms ojih odutola there has to be a principle that both african and european institutions agree with mr diagne when i had my first conversations with felwine he was telling me that many of his interlocutors civil servants functionaries or museum people would tell him you see it is so complicated legally we should really agree on the principle that these objects need to circulate the concept of circulation was being sold to him and he said yes circulation makes sense somehow africa has to share its art with the rest of the world but macron said restitution and restitution has a meaning so the authors said we will be sticking to that word if there is going to be circulation it should be africa lending the objects not the other way around ms fromont maybe in the future african countries will make long term loans to quai branly  her benign view of chinese competition is at odds with the prevailing mood in europe where there is a growing opposition toward china s push into world markets and its investment in key industries in europe such as industrial robots batteries for electric cars and construction machinery as in the united states european countries are increasingly suspicious of chinese intentions the americans have moved to restrict the use of chinese technology particularly from the telecommunications company huawei because of espionage concerns germany is scrutinizing whether there could be any security risk from equipment huawei is providing for a state of the art network europe has become huawei s biggest market outside china on tuesday mr altmaier the economics minister unveiled a so called national industrial strategy intended in part as a defense against china s growing industrial might the proposal would allow the government to buy stakes in companies with critical technologies to protect them from foreign takeover crrc the chinese train maker alarms foreign competitors because it can produce equipment cheaply in china and receives subsidies from the government giving it a price advantage in addition the government provides financing and other incentives to companies that award infrastructure contracts to crrc in fact chinese investment in europe declined last year because of the nation s slowing economy as well as increased scrutiny by local officials in germany chinese investors spent 10 7 billion in 2018 a 22 percent decline from 2017 according to a report published tuesday by the consulting firm ey li shufu the owner of the chinese automaker geely accounted for most of that when he spent an estimated 8 9 billion to buy about 10 percent of daimler europewide chinese investment plunged 46 percent to 31 billion ey said but analysts say that the decline is temporary and that china continues to covet european expertise and access to its market crrc s presence in the european train market is minuscule

circles they vary from single stones to complexes like stonehenge there are about 35 000 such monuments in europe many along the atlantic coast of france and spain in england ireland scandinavia and throughout the mediterranean they attract both tourists and archaeologists who have spent a century debating how the knowledge to build such monuments spread one idea suggested that this cultural change came from the near east and spread west along coastal routes perhaps by a priestly caste later theories suggested techniques may have developed independently in different locales but a scientist who analyzed 2 410 radiocarbon dates of megaliths and their surroundings reported on monday that the first such tombs appeared in france about 6 500 years ago and then spread along the atlantic and mediterranean coasts as well as to england ireland and scandinavia  the audience loved her her song had all the hallmarks of being a hit at eurovision the flamboyant european song contest

wrote to prime minister giuseppe conte of italy asking him to reject a request by iran for assistance in turning back the victim families request that iranian assets in italy be frozen the letter cited a 2014 italian constitutional court ruling that the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not protect violators of human rights from lawsuits the case is raising an important test of the legislative spree that congress went on after the sept 11 attacks to carve out a terrorism exception to sovereign immunity said harold hongju koh a yale law school professor of international law who served as the state department s top lawyer in the obama administration other countries did not follow suit either in law and practice everyone knew a case would come along that exposes the divergence between a more limited set of restrictions on sovereign immunity held globally and the united states emerging position on non immunity for various kinds of terrorist acts he said this case has exposed that seam the case in luxembourg has been closely watched not only by other victims of terrorist attacks holding similar default judgments but by diplomats and security officials as well critics have raised concerns that if it succeeds it would undermine the nuclear deal by making it harder for iran to reintegrate into the world economy strengthening the hand of hard liners in tehran who want to abandon the accord the ruling if it holds could help persuade iran to adhere to the nuclear deal despite the trump administration s reimposition of sanctions said payam mohseni the director of the iran project at harvard kennedy school s belfer center for science and international affairs through the luxembourg court ruling the iranians will be gauging how viable continued engagement with the west will be in the future particularly with the europeans he said if iranian assets are threatened in europe the value of staying in the nuclear agreement is significantly diminished for iran but the luxembourg ruling is also a setback to efforts to make it easier for victims of terrorist attacks to win compensation that have been more successful inside the united states  frankfurt the european central bank took control of a troubled italian bank wednesday an unprecedented step that spotlighted the risks to the eurozone s financial system from political chaos in rome and a sputtering economy while the bank banca carige is a midsize lender its fate has the potential to reverberate broadly among policymakers and economists looking for signs of the next crisis italy and its heavily indebted banks have been a source of concern for years and the policies and statements of the populist government in rome have recently added to the woes of italy s banks and by extension the whole economy it s not a bank large enough to cause systemic crisis said lorenzo codogno a former chief economist at italy s treasury who operates lc macro advisors a consultancy in london but he added we have seen that even small banks can cause huge problems the current government is not prepared for a full fledged banking crisis mr codogno said the action by europe s central bank on wednesday reassured investors so far that the vulnerabilities of banca carige the 10th largest lender in italy would not provoke a broader crisis  another comparison with the titanic could be made with the bastille s appearance which from certain angles resembles a cruise ship but ask 10 people in paris what the building looks like and you ll probably hear 10 different answers hospital swimming pool government office airport few if any would say it looks like an opera house the eminent french critic christian merlin who attended the earliest productions at the bastille recalled in an interview finding the building impressive but cold and gray somewhat anonymous mr lissner said it is absolutely not convincing aesthetically from the outside inside is not much different even entering is a challenge the door appears to be on the second floor accessible by way of a grand staircase but it s rarely used and newcomers are left to find the real entrance on the ground floor on a recent visit for the opening night of a new production of berlioz s les troyens the stairs were closed off with bright yellow tape despite the building s size the lobby spaces are narrow crowded and brightly lighted it is nearly impossible to make it through an entire intermission without getting pushed the theater itself which occupies only about 5 percent of the building is devoid of warmth its stone walls and fixtures have all the charm of a hotel convention center mr ott in a mid 2000s interview with the newsletter of the institut françois mitterrand said this was because he didn t want anything to detract from the performance balcony seats were designed to offer clear views of the stage which they do at the cost of some vertigo singers and directors alike must contend with the cavernous space manuel brug a german critic who has been visiting the theater for years said it is not possible to be intimate there in les troyens for example only the mezzo soprano stéphanie d oustrac as cassandre seemed at ease penetrating the orchestra and filling the hall the production s director dmitri tcherniakov overcame the bastille s dimensions by pushing the cityscape of troy back extremely far opening up the rear of the theater to give the set the depth of three stages  nature s mutiny how the little ice age of the long seventeenth century transformed the west and shaped the present by philipp blom from around 1570 to 1710 temperatures in the earth s northern hemisphere plunged by an average of about 2 degrees celsius roughly the same amount by which the planet s temperature is supposed to rise under the more catastrophic predictions of our warming futures two degrees colder meant a growing season shortened by three weeks the apocalyptic changes that are coming bigger storms higher seas longer heat waves more insect born disease remain for now a task for the imagination but the impact of those long ago icy winters frigid summers and torrential autumns requires no imagination it s all recorded in contemporary sources in nature s mutiny philipp blom a german historian treats this one well documented period of climate change the so called little ice age as an experiment in what can happen to a society when its baseline conditions all ultimately dependent upon the weather are shaken the premise of treating historical sources as a way of answering current questions is so good that blom should have stuck to it he is tempted however into making everything new in the 17th century a result of climate change and this can only be true by so diluting the notion of causation as to render his claim meaningless or just plain vulnerable image the initial crisis was food insecurity much as it will be for us hunger hit the countrysides of europe first if peasants starved and then abandoned the country for the cities the aristocrats who lived off peasant production for both food and wealth went down with them people living on the land at least had direct access to whatever food there was those in cities were dependent on rural surplus reaching them and when it didn t they rioted they were also pushed into even more extreme measures during the siege of paris in 1595 the starving defenders of the city discussed breaking into a cemetery removing the bones grinding them into a fine flour and then using it to bake bread  london after european policymakers adopted a sweeping data privacy law last year the big question was how regulators would use their newfound authority against the most powerful technology companies in the first major example the french data protection authority announced monday that it had fined google 50 million euros or about 57 million for not properly disclosing to users how data is collected across its services including its search engine google maps and youtube to present personalized advertisements the penalty is the largest to date under the european union privacy law known as the general data protection regulation which took effect in may and shows that regulators are following through on a pledge to use the rules to push back against internet companies whose businesses depend on collecting data facebook is also a subject of several investigations by the data protection authorities in europe the ruling signals a new phase in enforcing the european law which the region s lawmakers and privacy groups have cheered as a check against the growing power of technology companies while for general consumers it has led mostly to a frustrating increase in the number of consent boxes to click the fine against google is just the fourth penalty against any company since the law took effect  this has been a recurrent theme for de laurentiis this season he has singled out frosinone a minor team from a town between rome and naples promoted to italy s top league serie a for only the second time in its history last year as an example of a club that arrives in the top flight already relegated clubs like frosinone do not draw fans or interest or broadcasters to the league de laurentiis says they come up they do not try to compete and they go back down except with their coffers stuffed by what he sees as an unwarranted share of the division s television revenue the problem is the small teams have the same rights as the big ones he said adding with a reference to a type of bread why should frosinone have a season in serie a be given a slice of the pagnotta and then be relegated back to the third division if they cannot compete if they finish last they should have to pay a fine they shouldn t be given money for failing after yet another tangent in which he dismisses an overmatched club in a major league as a mere sparring partner he quickly builds up a head of steam promotion and relegation is the biggest idiocy in soccer de laurentiis says especially when you also have uefa trying to force clubs to comply with financial fair play rules clubs should be structured geographically so they can all be self sufficient if they cannot survive financially if they cannot be self sufficient they should be booted out it would be easy to listen to de laurentiis s words to hear the many and varied ways in which he feels soccer has gotten things wrong and to assume that he holds it in contempt that he has wearied of the sport in the 15 years or so since he bought up what remained of napoli just the name he has said previously and set about reinvigorating it his actions though are rather different de laurentiis is not distancing himself from soccer rather he is embedding himself more deeply in it he has for several years been seeking to add another club to his portfolio ideally he would have liked one in london we never found the occasion he said   we now have a strong common understanding of how to approach russia mr stoltenberg said those allies who were skeptical of dialogue with russia have seen that we have delivered on deterrence and defense the gatherings to commemorate nato s anniversary were originally planned as a week of events in washington for heads of state and government but mr trump s angry speeches public and private at other alliance gatherings over the last two years persuaded allies to downgrade the anniversary celebration to a meeting of foreign ministers the goal according to current and former american and european officials was to limit mr trump s participation even tuesday s meeting with mr trump was not originally on mr stoltenberg s agenda but then speaker nancy pelosi announced that she had invited the nato chief to address congress a speech that is scheduled for wednesday european officials said mr stoltenberg had not yet accepted the invitation when ms pelosi announced it that put him in the position of potentially leaving washington without seeing the president but addressing the democrat led house which has approved a measure that seeks to block mr trump from withdrawing from the military alliance last week nato made the unusual move of extending mr stoltenberg s term a second time by two more years meaning he would leave office in 2022 it is an acknowledgment of mr stoltenberg s deft touch not just with mr trump but also with other difficult alliance leaders including president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey and prime minister viktor orban of hungary mr trump endorsed the extension on tuesday i had no doubt in my mind who i wanted he said european officials said their worries about mr stoltenberg s cozy relationship with mr trump were pushed aside largely to avoid giving the president an outsize role in selecting a new nato leader mr stoltenberg was scheduled to step down in 2020 at the height of an intense election in the united states  in sharman s account the dominance of the west note europe s easy baton pass to the united states roughly from the enlightenment to world war ii represents a historical blip in the last millennium and perhaps more important today we seem to be on the cusp of a return to a more regular state of affairs where the large states of asia will again be the globe s hegemons to make this provocative argument sharman finds the early modern period conventionally dated from 1500 to 1800 the most fruitful for thinking about where we are headed in those centuries the enormous empires of the east the qing the ottomans and the mughals were the most formidable states on earth territory equaled power and those states held the most land image much of this book turns on sharman s critique of what historians term the military revolution thesis the idea that advanced military technologies led to europe s domination of the world beginning around 1500 sharman shows this not to be true for example he dismantles the notion that the period of western overseas expansion led to the rise of europe either militarily or politically asia s enormous land based empires didn t much care about their coastlines and tolerated more than they succumbed to the europeans nibbling on their shores in what were desperate highly risky and ultimately temporary ventures until approximately 1750 europeans even in europe thanks to the ottomans held no military advantage over other powers but how then to explain the undeniable fact that europeans dominated the globe from the turn of the 19th century to world war i sharman reasons that it was a combination of internal fractures within the qing and ottoman empires as well as the inclination of europeans to think that empire building was the route to national sovereignty in other words almost a kind of vanity project he might have said more about how exactly europe achieved temporary global pre eminence especially as it would bolster his argument that this was a deviation from the norm of the last millennium  berlin in germany women are paid an average of 21 percent less than men one of europe s widest gender pay gaps in berlin next week for one day only the public transportation system will offer them a corresponding discount the bvg which runs the city s bus tram and subway systems and is the country s largest public transit authority will offer women an unlimited day pass for 5 50 euros about 6 20 instead of the regular 7 the frauenticket or women s ticket is limited to monday which campaigners in germany have designated as equal pay day and the authority is calling the promotion mind the pay gap the women s ticket not only challenges the discriminatory wage gap in our country but also shows that the bvg itself is doing something about it sigrid nikutta the authority s director said   it has to be more he said mr shanahan a former boeing executive is stuck between president trump s rhetoric and the long shadow of mr mattis a retired marine general who resigned from his position in december in his resignation letter mr mattis wrote of his firm belief that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships and pointed to the divide between him and mr trump on that score as a reason for stepping down mattis s departure was an earthquake said jim townsend who served as a deputy assistant secretary of defense for european and nato policy under former president barack obama now nato is looking to see whether mr shanahan is going to be someone closer to the mold of mattis or be more like what comes out of the white house on thursday after meeting with defense ministers about the nato training mission in afghanistan mr shanahan said there would be no unilateral troop reduction when asked by reporters about allied concerns about a rapid withdrawal even before he flew to brussels his trip this week tested his skill in international affairs starting with a stop in afghanistan to meet with president ashraf ghani who objects to being excluded from peace talks involving the trump administration and the resurgent taliban he traveled to iraq and met with prime minister adel abdul mahdi days after iraqi politicians reacted angrily to mr trump s talk of keeping american troops in that country to watch iran mr trump has praised mr shanahan the deputy secretary under mr mattis and said that he could be running the pentagon for a long time but the president has not nominated him or anyone else to be defense secretary and mr shanahan has started to draw fire from some lawmakers who consider him to be out of his element on tuesday senator james m inhofe the chairman of the armed services committee said he did not think mr shanahan would be nominated and that he lacked the humility of mr mattis  paris french security forces fanned out across paris and other cities on saturday as the country faced a 19th weekend of yellow vest demonstrations following a surge of violence last week that caught the authorities by surprise after months of dwindling numbers and calmer protests though sporadic clashes erupted late in the day violence dropped on saturday as protesters marched peacefully in the french capital and elsewhere nearly 6 000 police officers were out on the streets of paris especially around the champs élysées and the arc de triomphe which have become the focus of protests and where the authorities this past week banned demonstrations  berlin swastikas daubed on a jewish cemetery in france an anti semitic political campaign by hungary s far right government labour lawmakers in britain quitting their party and citing ingrained anti semitism a belgian carnival float caricaturing orthodox jews sitting on bags of money and that was just the past few months the accumulated incidents in europe and the united states have highlighted how an ancient prejudice is surging in the 21st century in both familiar and mutant ways fusing ideologies that otherwise would have little overlap the spike is taking place in a context of rising global economic uncertainty an emphasis on race and national identity and a deepening polarization between the political left and right in europe and the united states over the conflict between israel and the palestinians there s an ideological pattern that is

myself he recalled teachers telling him it would be better if i behaved more like a boy it would make my life easier mr gosniowski was beaten by other students who used homophobic slurs he did not yet understand he does not want other young people to suffer as he did so he welcomed the decision by the mayor of warsaw to introduce a declaration last month aimed at promoting tolerance but the backlash to the declaration has left him shaken poland s governing party law and justice has seized on the declaration and the issue of gay rights in its campaigning for european union elections in may and for national elections this fall  the court noted that at the time she was accused of killing ms kercher a briton ms knox had been particularly vulnerable being a foreign young woman 20 at the time not having been in italy for very long and not being fluent in italian her statements during the interrogation had been taken in an atmosphere of intense psychological pressure the court said the case made headlines for years in italy the united states and britain during her interrogation in 2007 ms knox accused her boss a pub manager of killing ms kercher but he was subsequently exonerated a court later found that she had committed slander and the european court decision concerned the process leading to that conviction on thursday ms knox who is 31 now and lives in seattle wrote on her blog that she had spent years wracked with guilt over those statements i signed in the interrogation room ms knox her boyfriend at the time of the killing raffaele sollecito and a third man rudy guede were found guilty of ms kercher s murder in 2009 but in 2015 italy s highest court not only overturned the conviction of mr sollecito and ms knox who had served four years in prison it took the rare step of fully exonerating them mr guede is still serving a 16 year sentence in lodging her complaint with the european court in 2013 ms knox said she had not been assisted by a lawyer during the all night interrogation and had not been provided with a professional interpreter she also claimed to have been subjected to extreme psychological pressure an allegation the court would determine was unfounded  the irish backstop a portion of the agreement for britain s planned withdrawal from the european union has been a near constant point of tension since the country began the brexit process but the two players most affected by the potential outcome of this particular element of the exit ireland an independent nation that will remain a part of the european union after britain s exit and northern ireland a region that is part of the united kingdom and is set to leave the bloc often get left out of the conversation so what do ireland and northern ireland want as britain heads toward the next brexit deadline and can both be satisfied what is the backstop and why is it a factor ireland and northern ireland have recently enjoyed cooperation across their shared border which for decades had been a pressure point in sectarian struggles known as the troubles  rome women of all ages and some men took to the streets in a dozen cities around the world on saturday the anniversary of the 2017 women s march that served as a strong rebuke of president trump s policies the annual marches and rallies have taken on wider themes since then such as challenging the rise of the far right while also calling for an end to inequality the gender pay gap and violence against women some events were organized in response to a call from the united states to create a women s wave but others were held independently and in many cases the core message was that women s rights are about more than mr trump in cities across the united states women braved subzero temperatures in some parts of the country to march even as accusations of anti semitism have rocked the movement and prompted questions about its future  i also get the resentment of brits at having regulations set by faceless e u bureaucrats in brussels and i get their resentment at the globalized urban elites who those in the rural areas here believed looked down at them and i get the squeeze on middle class wages here that gets blamed unfairly on the e u and immigrants the way president trump blames mexicans i get all of that but i also get what it means to be a leader in the 21st century and it sure doesn t mean asserting your sovereignty over all other considerations or breaking out of the giant e u market where the u k sends over 40 percent of its exports without a serious national discussion of the costs and benefits what do the most effective leaders today have in common they wake up every morning and ask themselves the same questions what world am i living in what are the biggest trends in this world and how do i educate my citizens about this world and align my policies so more of my people can get the best out of these trends and cushion the worst so what world are we living in for starters we re living in a world that is becoming so interconnected thanks to digitization the internet broadband mobile devices the cloud and soon to be 5g wireless transmissions that we are becoming interdependent to an unprecedented degree in this world growth increasingly depends on the ability of yourself your community your town your factory your school and your country to be connected to more and more of the flows of knowledge and investment and not just rely on stocks of stuff over centuries notes john hagel who currently co heads deloitte s center for the edge business has been organized around stocks of knowledge as the basis for value creation the key to creating economic value has been to acquire some proprietary knowledge stocks aggressively protect those knowledge stocks and then efficiently extract the economic value from those knowledge stocks and deliver them to the market the challenge in a more rapidly changing world is that knowledge stocks depreciate at an accelerating rate in this kind of world the key source of economic value shifts from stocks to flows the companies that will create the most economic value in the future hagel says will be the ones that find ways to participate more effectively in a broader range of more diverse knowledge flows that can refresh knowledge stocks at an accelerating rate  with the start of the new year belgium became the latest european country to ban traditional jewish and muslim animal slaughtering practices the move was applauded by animal rights activists but condemned by religious leaders who see the ban as a threat to their communities at issue is whether to allow religious exemptions to european union rules that state animals must be knocked out before they are slaughtered which supporters say is more humane the united states has similar regulations but allows for religious exemptions both faiths require that the animal be treated well in life and be healthy and unharmed before slaughter which all jewish religious authorities and some muslim ones interpret as a prohibition of stunning before slaughter religious leaders say minimizing an animal s pain has always been central to their traditions and a ritual slaughter carried out with a sharp blade to the neck should be quick and almost painless  london president trump s push for a border wall hints at a problem that populist leaders are facing across the western world after a year of setbacks populist leaders and parties are trying to rejuvenate their fortunes by revitalizing the sense of crisis on which they thrive but as with mr trump s demand for a border wall which has brought a two week government shutdown this may say more about populism s weakness than its strength immigration and terrorism crises which aided populism s world shaking rise in 2016 have waned populists have faced disappointing election results in germany the united states and even poland shattering the image of the movement s inevitability and its claims to represent true popular will the west s populist leaders and parties have grown defensive retreating into ever starker messages of us versus them the approach excites their most dedicated followers but it can be risky forcing voters to pick sides at a moment when the populist right holds declining appeal  the british parliament s long anticipated vote on a plan to withdraw from the european union also known as brexit came to its expected conclusion on tuesday night when lawmakers weighed in on a deal proposed by prime minister theresa may no one really thought that at the last minute mrs may would be able to pull a rabbit out of her hat to secure approval for the plan and she didn t with her brexit deal rejected by a vote of 432 to 202 now she has to go hat in hand to brussels to see if she can work some magic there spoiler alert she almost certainly cannot here s what to know as britain enters uncharted territory of the process that is brexit the opposition has called a vote of no confidence on tuesday night jeremy corbyn the leader of the opposition labour party called for a vote of no confidence in mrs may s government denouncing what he called its sheer incompetence  london if you ask british voters what sort of plan for leaving the european union they support you tend to get hesitant vague answers but ask them what they oppose and you hear forceful clarity no to prime minister theresa may s deal no to leaving the european union without a deal no to remoaners as tabloids call those who want to stay in the bloc no to ms may herself whose approval ratings are deeply negative no to her rival and leader of the labour party jeremy corbyn whose poll numbers are even worse in a recent yougov poll asking britons whether ms may or mr corbyn would make the better prime minister the runaway winner was not sure  brussels the trump administration downgraded the diplomatic status of the european union s delegation to the united states last year without making a formal announcement or informing the bloc about the change a european official said on tuesday after protest from brussels and discussion between the european union and the trump administration the reclassification of the delegation and the consequent demotion of the ambassador david o sullivan is understood to have been reversed at least temporarily the official said mr trump has been critical of multilateral institutions and his secretary of state mike pompeo delivered a provocative speech in brussels on dec 4 in which he questioned the value of multinational organizations and institutions like the united nations and the european union mr pompeo then asked whether the european union was ensuring that the interests of countries and their citizens are placed before those of bureaucrats here in brussels the next day the european union s demotion from a member state to an international organization became clear at the funeral of president george bush when mr o sullivan s name was not called in the expected order dictated by diplomatic protocols the names of diplomats who had gathered in washington to pay their respects were spoken as is custom from the longest serving to the newest ambassador a european union official told the german news agency deutsche welle but he was called up as the last person  london the european union penalized iran on tuesday over allegations that the country s intelligence service orchestrated a series of assassination plots in europe in recent years including the killing of two iranians in the netherlands with ties to anti government extremist groups in a letter outlining its justification for sanctions the dutch foreign ministry cited strong indications that iran was involved in the assassinations of two dutch nationals of iranian origin one in 2015 in the city of almere and another in 2017 in the hague european intelligence officials have also linked the iranian government to unsuccessful plots in denmark and france in the dutch government s opinion hostile acts of this kind flagrantly violate the sovereignty of the netherlands and are unacceptable the letter said  london top officials of the european union tossed prime minister theresa may a lifeline on wednesday saying they would allow britain to push back its departure date from the bloc but only if parliament endorsed her withdrawal plan lawmakers have twice already rejected mrs may s plan emphatically but in the unlikely event they changed their minds britain would still need an extension the march 29 deadline is so near there is no way lawmakers can pass the supporting legislation needed to put any withdrawal plan into effect in offering an extension but tying it to a vote in parliament the european union officials appeared to be trying to strengthen mrs may s position and pressure british lawmakers to fall into line behind her plan which would allow britain to exit the bloc but maintain its trade ties until at least the end of 2020 if they don t the alternative may be an outcome many of the lawmakers like even less than the prime minister s plan a break from the bloc with no provisions for cushioning its economic impact a so called no deal brexit or an even lengthier delay and that could potentially mean no withdrawal from the bloc at all  amsterdam a cathedral in germany has agreed to return a nazi looted painting to the heirs of gottlieb and mathilde kraus an austrian jewish couple from whom it was stolen in 1941 according to the commission for looted art in europe which has spent the last eight years negotiating the restitution the painting view of a dutch square attributed to the golden age painter jan van der heyden was one of about 160 looted from the kraus family in 1941 retrieved by the allies after the war and returned to the bavarian state but instead of ensuring its restitution to the family from which it was stolen the bavarian government sold it back to the heir of the nazi official who bought it during the war i m excited and happy that it s coming to a resolution but i m struck both by the weight of my family and the solemnity of the occasion john graykowski an american great grandson of the krauses said in a telephone interview from xanten germany where church officials were expected to turn over the painting on thursday  the scars though are still visible
