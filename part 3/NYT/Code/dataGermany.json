berlin the reunification of germany in 1990 was a moment of exalted pride for the postwar federal republic after decades of warning that a united country would resurrect the horrors of the 20th century its neighbors and allies many of them former battlefield foes came around to accept and even welcome it that s in large part because during those same decades west germany had undertaken a self administered vergangenheitsbewältigung a mouthful of a german word that translates as something like the overcoming of the past and refers to the country s collective effort to grapple with the causes and legacies of the nazi era it was a painful halting process but it helped transform germany from pariah state to the moral leader of continental europe in recent years though the achievements of the postwar era have come under scrutiny our culture of remembrance is crumbling germany s foreign minister heiko maas said recently the most damning evidence is the hard right alternative for germany party which surged into the bundestag in 2017 in parts of eastern germany it is the most popular party the afd is riding a shocking rise of german anti semitism and xenophobia forty percent of germans say it s right to blame jews for israel s policies in the middle east in my neighborhood in berlin and others across the country people wearing jewish headgear are harassed on the street and in the aftermath of the refugee crisis of 2015 16 many germans including mainstream middle class citizens embraced the far right s premises in surveys ever more say they desire an authoritarian leader and distrust liberal democracy the afd gives cover to expanded expressions of intolerance and hate in the bundestag the party s members speak about foreigners the holocaust and muslims in a way that a decade ago would have triggered a full blown scandal but that today is commonplace they downplay the significance of the nazi era and demean efforts to reconcile with the past like the holocaust memorial in berlin popular tv shows and best sellers set in the nazi era treat germans as victims not perpetrators at the same time 40 percent of young germans say they know very little or nothing about the holocaust  berlin two days after a right wing politician was assaulted in germany drawing international attention the authorities on wednesday said that several elements of the account given by his political party appeared to be false frank magnitz 66 a member of parliament from the alternative for germany party suffered head injuries in the attack in bremen on monday party officials said that three men had attacked him beating him with a piece of lumber and then kicking him after he had fallen to the ground but after reviewing a video of the attack law enforcement officials said that one assailant had struck mr magnitz once from behind knocking him down before he and two others fled the scene no one hit the lawmaker with an object they said and no one kicked him we assume that all of the injuries are the result of the fall said frank passade a spokesman for the state s attorney s office in bremen which is investigating the assault  berlin the director steven spielberg cited a renewed cycle of hate in society behind his decision to bring schindler s list back to movie theaters around the world hoping it would provoke discussion an independent movie theater in western germany embraced that very idea when it offered free tickets to members of the far right alternative for germany party or afd to its screening of the classic film on jan 27 holocaust remembrance day but some members of the afd whose leaders have dismissed the nazi era as a speck of bird poop in more than 1 000 years of successful german history and have referred to the country s main holocaust memorial as a monument of shame saw the offer from the cinexx theater more as a provocation than an invitation they have called it a tasteless instrumentalization and a senseless provocation members of left leaning political parties and others in germany have praised the offer however as justification they point to the afd s penchant for reciting slogans like germany for the germans for questioning the country s post world war ii culture of atonement and for being willing to march alongside neo nazis during protests in the eastern city of chemnitz  he has since been released on grounds there was not sufficient reason to hold him in detention pending the outcome of the investigation said georg ungefuk a prosecutor with the frankfurt based office responsible for cybercrimes which is carrying out the investigation germany s main government network was breached by hackers in 2015 and the authorities worried that information obtained then would be used against politicians leading up to the 2017 election those fears were largely unfounded but mr seehofer the interior minister warned that last month s breach should be a warning to everyone especially ahead of the european parliamentary election in may we must be prepared that outside actors may want to influence this election and take every precaution to prevent this and do what we can to recognize such an action as early as possible he said it could be a very different perpetrator despite the shock that a single person was able to agitate and alarm the country s political establishment mr münch pointed out that many young people had committed crimes from computers in their bedrooms citing examples of teens who had been caught selling weapons or drugs over the dark web areas of the internet hidden from the view of most users dirk engling spokesman for the chaos computer club a german collective of hackers said the hack itself wasn t technically difficult but required a great deal of patience in order to learn the necessary passwords he listed previous examples in germany of such hacks where an individual s private information was stolen for the purposes of publishing online known in the tech world as doxxing but pointed out that they had largely gone ignored by policymakers now that they have been snatched from their online accounts suddenly it seems to have changed some minds mr engling said  berlin three men attacked a lawmaker from the far right party alternative for germany the police said tuesday leaving the official with serious injuries to his head and upper body the lawmaker frank magnitz 66 the leader of the party s chapter in bremen was attacked on monday and remained hospitalized on tuesday thomas jürgewitz the deputy head of the bremen chapter said in a telephone interview he added that mr magnitz was expected to make a full recovery a photograph posted to facebook by the afd bremen chapter showed mr magnitz bloodied and bruised with a deep gash on his forehead the brutality of the attack and the rarity of such violence against a public official prompted widespread condemnation and calls for justice from across the country s political spectrum the brutal attack on the member of the bundestag frank magnitz in bremen is to be condemned sharply steffen seibert a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel s government wrote on twitter hopefully the police will be able to catch the perpetrators quickly  berlin after hackers later determined to be working for russia broke into parliament s main computer network three years ago the government vowed to fortify its cybersecurity the authorities schooled lawmakers about changing passwords using two step identification and other measures to protect online data but on friday nearly 1 000 lawmakers and other prominent germans including rappers journalists and internet personalities awoke to find links to their street and email addresses private chats from social media bank account details and pictures of their children published on twitter in another major breach aimed at the country s political establishment all those attacked had a history of criticizing the far right whose politicians appeared to be spared raising suspicion that the hacker or hackers were sympathetic to their agenda though the authorities said they had no indication yet who was behind the attack the breach spread a fresh round of alarm in germany a country where citizens especially covet their privacy and once again raised the disconcerting question of whether even the most vigilant and sophisticated individuals and governments can safeguard their computers and the valuable personal financial and other sensitive information that resides there  berlin targeting foreigners a man repeatedly drove his car at pedestrians celebrating new year s eve in western germany injuring four people before being arrested the police and prosecutors said tuesday the suspect made comments disparaging of foreigners when the police detained and questioned him herbert reul interior minister for the state of north rhine westphalia where the attacks took place told reporters on tuesday this is a case of a german deliberately driving into groups of people people who for the most part were foreigners mr reul said that means this man clearly intended to kill foreigners at least three adults and one child among them a syrian and an afghan were struck and severely injured officials said  berlin germany s domestic intelligence agency took a first step on tuesday toward placing the far right alternative for germany party under surveillance as a threat to the country s democracy announcing that it would formally observe its youth wing which it called extremist it was the first time in germany s postwar history that a party seated in parliament was put under such scrutiny setting the stage for a looming battle between the state and a party whose strength has steadily grown even as its suspected associations with neo nazi groups have stirred concern the leaders of alternative for germany or afd as the party is known routinely attack the press accuse muslim immigrants of being criminals and question the principles of liberal democracy the warning on tuesday was issued by the federal office for the protection of the constitution an agency whose founding mission when it was established after world war ii was to protect against the rise of political forces primarily another nazi party that could once again threaten germany s democracy  berlin german prosecutors on monday filed aggravated fraud charges against martin winterkorn the former chief executive of volkswagen who led the company when it deceived regulators about its vehicles diesel exhaust levels the charges are the first criminal indictment in germany against an individual in connection with the diesel scandal which has cost volkswagen tens of billions of dollars since it came to light in 2015 in charging mr winterkorn and four volkswagen managers whose names were not released the public prosecutor s office in braunschweig tied the five to events reaching as far back as 2006 when the deception was initially conceived the timeline is significant because it rejects initial claims by volkswagen that senior management became aware of the so called defeat devices used to cheat emissions tests only after being confronted by the united states environmental authorities in 2015   it s a very emotional topic confided stefan gerwens the head of transport and mobility at adac an automobile club with 20 million members which is opposed to any speed limit so emotional apparently that facts and figures count for little germany is woefully behind on meeting its 2020 climate goals so the government appointed a group of experts to find ways to lower emissions in the transport sector cars account for 11 percent of total emissions and their share is rising a highway speed limit of 120 kilometers an hour or 75 miles per hour could cover a fifth of the gap to reach the 2020 goals for the transport sector environmental experts say of all the individual measures it is the one that would be the most impactful and it costs nothing said dorothee saar of deutsche umwelthilfe a nonprofit environmental organization that has lobbied for a speed limit but when it comes to cars ms saar sighed the debate tends to become irrational there are already speed limits on almost 30 percent of roughly 8 000 miles of autobahn imposed to regulate noise near urban centers and reduce safety risks on roads deemed unfit for unlimited speeding the number of deadly accidents on stretches of autobahn that have a speed limit is 26 percent lower than on those without in 2017 409 people died on the autobahn and in almost half the cases the reason was inappropriate speeding according to the german statistics office  to the editor re autobahn speed limits voting with lead feet germany dispatch front page feb 4 having lived and worked in germany for about eight years i feel that this article paints a rather one sided picture of driving on the autobahns i have no issue with the benefit of reasonable speed limits and believe that germans resistance to them is irrational but the article makes it sound as though driving the autobahns is like the wild west far from it german drivers are on the whole far more regimented and diligent than the american drivers i encounter now that i m back living in the united states my two biggest complaints here and they re related are people driving slowly in the passing lanes and tailgating in germany drivers strictly adhere to the concept that you drive in the right hand lane and use the left lane only to pass a car moving immediately back to the right lane this frees up the fast lane for cars that choose to drive faster here cars drive any speed they choose in any lane with the result that cars wanting to drive faster either tailgate or continually change lanes and pass on the right both actions that increase the risks of an accident which is more dangerous no speed limits with diligent drivers or what we have on our freeways matthew milukas aptos calif  harvey g simmons toronto the writer is emeritus professor of political science at york university to the editor jamie daw argues we can transition from obamacare to germany s universal health care system far more easily than we can persuade whom to accept single payer poll after poll shows americans long for a single payer plan but we cannot ignore the differences between a country that accepts limits on profiteering and one that celebrates any and all legal means of turning any opportunity into a buck as long as health insurance companies donate to politicians we can t hope for a government that eliminates their profits without getting rid of for profit health insurance we cannot get the obscene expense of treating illness in this country down to manageable levels in spite of dr daw s optimism we cannot transition from profitability to a system based on the values associated with compassion as long as health insurance companies continue to stand between us and the care we need to thrive candida pugh oakland calif to the editor so let me see if i have this right because a german chancellor otto von bismarck came up with an inefficient way to provide universal health care almost 140 years ago the united states should now copy his system there are too many flaws in jamie daw s case to enumerate in a short letter but let me take just one dr daw states in germany sickness funds leverage market power to secure lower prices coming together regionally to negotiate contracts with doctors and hospitals in the united states health insurance companies which are much larger and have much more market power than german sickness funds have had the ability to negotiate for lower prices for the better part of a century the result has been what we have by far the most expensive health care system in the world what on earth makes dr daw think that with a snap of the fingers this already existing market power will suddenly yield a better result private insurance companies add an extra layer of expense that is totally unnecessary we can do better wesley h clark middlebury vt the writer is an anesthesiologist to the editor i am an american expat who has been living in germany for many years and have intimate knowledge of and experience with its health care system jamie daw s essay is not representative of the realities pitfalls and serious systemic problems that exist in the german system and do not reflect the fact that most of the population is getting substandard care indeed the german system is just as bad as the american system just with a different set of failures that need to be addressed stew green brandscheid germany to the editor one important aspect of health care that jamie daw does not mention is the education of medical providers the cost of medical school in germany is a tiny fraction of the cost in the united states medical schools can cost as much as 75 000 per year or 300 000 in total for tuition fees and living expenses during the additional four to eight years of internship residency and fellowship young doctors are barely paid enough to cover basic housing and living costs most are not only acquiring substantial debt but also forgoing about 10 years of earning and saving  in the second half of the 20th century the great fault line in german politics ran between the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian sister party the christian social union and the liberal social democrats the right was generally against government spending except on the military and held traditional values on abortion and marriage the left supported a more beneficent welfare state and a more open german culture above all they divided on class the middle class on the right the workers on the left that all changed in the 21st century the new divide is between two groups that the british author david goodhart terms anywheres and somewheres the anywheres are the highly educated urban and socially liberal the somewheres live in the countryside have a lower level of education and hold more traditional notions of family and society the growing popularity of the greens bears witness to this trend the party s core theme remains ecological but it is increasingly taking stands on on social matters such as immigration and gay marriage which are primarily of interest to anywheres they reject both the class centric politics of the social democrats as well as the traditional value minded christian democrats that s why the christian democrats managed to hold on in rural parts of bavaria even as the social democrats were wiped out a similar story has played out in neighboring baden württemberg where a green politician winfried kretschmann has been in charge since 2011 but the greens main competitor is not the christian democrats nor the social democrats but the free democrats known informally as the liberals both the greens and the liberals agree on many of the cultural issues that divided the old left and right like abortion and gay rights but they divide over contemporary flash points like technology the liberals embrace its growing role in society the greens are skeptical immigration the liberals support a canadian style rules based system the greens are for much more open borders and economics in this regard they mimic their predecessors this then is the new center of gravity in mainstream german politics the christian democrats and the social democrats still exist of course but they have become obsolete by convergence they are ruling together for their third term their kinship is one result of the changing axis of values in politics most german voters across the political spectrum now agree on the things that once divided them and their leading parties  berlin germany s most notorious far right politician björn höcke a man who has called the holocaust memorial in berlin a monument of shame was furious when he woke up one morning to find a section of the memorial built to scale outside his bedroom window it was november 2017 mr höcke sued the artist who had secretly rented the neighboring property and prepared the stunt over many months he tried to have him evicted he even launched criminal proceedings against him but to no avail the rental lease is open ended and the replica of the holocaust memorial remains but where civil and criminal proceedings have failed a state prosecutor has stepped in it emerged wednesday the prosecutor s office in mr höcke s eastern home state thuringia is investigating the artist philipp ruch on suspicion of forming a criminal association a legal provision known as paragraph 129 which gives the state far reaching surveillance rights and is normally applied to criminal groups and suspected extremists the investigation which was revealed in the answer to a routine parliamentary question is now raising questions about whether the law is being leveraged by far right sympathizers to crack down on their opponents mr höcke s party the far right alternative for germany the country s third largest party in parliament is particularly strong in the former communist east of the country  when a preliminary report for the federal transportation ministry recommended speed limits on the autobahn and higher gas prices to lower carbon emissions the public response was so hostile that the ministry disavowed it even children are considered fair game greta thunberg the 16 year old swedish climate activist is a favorite target of the german right with the secretary general of the christian democrats calling her political stance pure ideology how did the environment become so hot so fast first there are good reasons to be angry when the german government calls for significant sacrifices by everyday citizens for the health of the planet even as it let volkswagen and other carmakers get away with cheating on emissions data at the same time populist parties in germany and europe are increasingly campaigning against environmental rules such opposition perfectly fits into populist narratives and patterns skepticism about science anger over political correctness and a libertarian reflex against government regulations in general the mainstream right is following suit claiming to try to cut off the far right but in reality taking advantage of a suddenly attractive political target environmental issues produce the same fundamental cleavages as migration both migration and environmental policies are aiming at global and moral goals that citizens profit from only in the abstract while the costs are immediate accepting asylum seekers is a global moral responsibility the costs overcrowded kindergartens and schools neighborhood tensions are local getting rid of old diesel cars might be a vital step toward fighting climate change but how are you supposed to get to work on immigration or the environment where you stand is a matter of your worldview whether you drive a car or ride a bike has become a symbol for embracing or rejecting a whole set of values connected to the notion of global responsibility conservatives and traditionalists feel they are being pressured by the cultural imperialism of urban liberal elites who can afford not to have a car and it s on this divide more than on any particular policy where the clash is hottest annegret kramp karrenbauer the new head of the christian democrats recently lashed out against berlin s latte macchiato drinkers while mr scheuer the minister of transportation said in an interview in berlin s political scene people are gloating over discussions which often have nothing to do with the everyday realities of people outside the capital  berlin times are rough for the european union the news coming from britain grows more depressing every day italy is governed by a maverick government searching for an open confrontation with france hungary and poland are slowly slipping into authoritarianism and we are headed for a european election in may that could result in further gains by populist parties it is tempting then to see a ray of hope in an agreement by germany and france announced on friday for a eurozone budget which the two countries will present to their fellow member states maybe after years of delay paris and berlin are finally taking the initiative to reverse europe s seemingly unstoppable slow motion disintegration not so fast this latest deal aside france and germany both founding powers of the european union and its most powerful members have been growing increasingly at odds the discord is driven in part by differences over concrete policy proposals but the bigger intractable problem is a fundamental difference in their visions for europe this being europe the two countries have done their best to paper over their differences with rhetorical displays of unity in november french president emmanuel macron stood on the floor of the german bundestag to deliver a speech marking the 100th anniversary of the end of world war i not holding back he described the franco german relationship as one of love a love born of the many catastrophes of the 20th century on jan 22 the two countries even renewed their vows so to speak by signing an update to the 1963 elysée treaty which announced a new era of comity between the two former enemies  berlin as he held up one of the new posters about the importance of wearing a helmet when cycling the german transport minister said the safety campaign was intended to draw attention it s all about getting noticed the minister andreas scheuer said at the official unveiling last week the posters have certainly achieved that the focus has not been on the helmets though but rather on the lack of other clothing worn by the models who are pictured in their underwear and on the language used which many consider vulgar embarrassing stale and sexist was how one lawmaker described the campaign half naked women and men should not be put onto posters at taxpayers expense the lawmaker katja mast told the german daily passauer neue presse  in a direct challenge to facebook s business model germany s competition authority on thursday sharply curtailed how the tech giant may profile people saying that users could refuse to allow the company to combine their facebook information with data about their activities on other sites the agency in a novel antitrust argument said that the company had exploited its dominant position in the german market by coercing people into giving up their personal data the social network s terms of service regulators said had unfairly forced people to make an all or nothing choice between submitting to unlimited data collection by the company or not using facebook at all the practice has enabled the silicon valley company to collect data about its users activities on millions of non facebook sites personal details that helped make the social network a worldwide powerhouse of personalized advertising but german regulators ruled that facebook would now have to stop automatically collecting and combining that data and instead give german users a choice they also prohibited the company from merging information from facebook accounts with data from the users accounts on other facebook owned services like instagram and whatsapp without permission  berlin germany s second richest family built its multibillion dollar fortune with krispy kreme doughnuts jimmy choo shoes and calvin klein perfume and forced laborers under the nazis the reimann family which controls the consumer goods conglomerate jab holding company recently commissioned a historian to dig deep into company archives and shed light on its activities during the 12 years of nazi rule the initial revelations 74 years after world war ii ended are damning albert reimann sr and his son albert reimann jr who ran the company in the 1930s and 1940s were enthusiastic hitler supporters and anti semites who condoned the abuse of forced laborers not only in their industrial chemicals company in southern germany but also in their own home female workers from eastern europe were forced to stand at attention naked in their factory barracks those who refused were sexually abused workers were kicked and beaten among them one russian woman who cleaned in the reimanns private villa  berlin a criminal investigation into an artist who built a partial replica of germany s national holocaust memorial next to the home of a far right politician has been formally closed more than 16 months after it began but less than a week after its existence became public reverberations from the inquiry into the artist philipp ruch and his collective the center for political beauty have continued to spread on thursday a letter was released from more than 100 prominent german cultural figures academics and politicians expressing disbelief at the investigation which employed a legal provision more often used to monitor gangs extremist groups and terrorist cells the letter demands an apology and an explanation from those who undertook the investigation and calls on them to disclose any political links martin zschächner an attorney for the state of thuringia who was in charge of the case has been accused by the left wing politician who uncovered the inquiry of being soft on far right offenders the outcry has come after a public discussion about right wing activists in positions of public authority and after several publicized cases of extremists among police and army officers  and in december germany s political leaders agreed to lower the threshold at which foreign investment in security related industries including energy suppliers railways and digital infrastructure prompts government intervention a step clearly aimed at china this policy was already in place in practice last year the german state bank kfw bought a 20 percent share of 50hertz a power distributing company to block a bid by the state grid corporation of china the ministries of finance and economy cited security as the reason for the unusual move but is all this enough policymakers and diplomats refrain from speaking of a paradigm shift in germany s china politics we have carefully adjusted our policy said niels annen the minister of state at the foreign office indeed unlike germany s foreign policy on russia the country s relations with china are under less vigorous and ideological public scrutiny russia is a passionately divisive topic most germans could care less about china and diplomats probably like it that way when it comes to china germany has to walk a very thin line in a rapidly changing international environment the trans atlantic relationship has been rattled since donald trump took office germany suddenly finds itself agreeing with china more on certain issues like climate change than with the united states its longtime ally as a consequence german diplomats have to play a tricky game partnering with an ideological adversary against its close ally on some issues while sticking with that suddenly difficult ally against its most important trading partner on others and in both cases it has to stand by its commitment to the rules based international order when neither of those partners holds the same level of commitment at least at the moment how much longer germany can continue to walk this line while staying committed to the old trans atlantic relationship remains to be seen mr huotari of the mercator institute expects germany to be put on the spot sooner or later china may be content as long as germany doesn t take sides with the united states he said but the united states is expecting us to clearly position ourselves we are in the middle of the game already and the pressure is going to increase germany s best option seems to be finding safety in numbers by uniting its european allies not least because part of china s geopolitical strategy is to divide europe six years ago it established the 16 1 framework an initiative to engage 16 central and eastern european countries 11 of which are members of the european union in closer relations to influence european policies in its favor lately however several of those countries have become disenchanted in some china is having trouble keeping up with its investment promises others like poland face increasing pressure from washington to loosen ties with beijing this could be germany s opening but it has to play it exactly right and uniting western central and eastern europe is no easy task it is the eternal quandary of german foreign policy germany can t go it alone but europe is too divided and too slow to step up follow the new york times opinion section on facebook twitter nytopinion and instagram  officials have not identified the husband but german news media have reported he is an isis member believed to be living in the region where iraq borders turkey if convicted jennifer w faces a maximum sentence of life in prison the trial is important for all yazidi survivors said nadia murad a yazidi activist who survived being forced into sexual slavery by isis and went on to be awarded the nobel peace prize every survivor i have met and spoken to is waiting for the same thing for the perpetrators to be prosecuted for their crimes against yazidis including women and children the mother of the girl was found with the help of yazda an organization that has been documenting crimes committed against the yazidi minority since 2015 germany is struggling with how to handle dozens of women who left the country for syria and iraq many of whom married isis fighters and now have children who are german citizens while they are legally allowed to return home many germans do not want to see them allowed back without being tried for their roles in supporting the terror organization but german law requires concrete proof of wrongdoing so without evidence like photos showing them posing with weapons or social media accounts where they spread propaganda or sought to recruit others it can be difficult to bring charges against them in the case of jennifer w prosecutors were helped by her own eagerness to tell the man who offered to drive her as far as turkey about her life in isis american intelligence officials had tipped off their colleagues in germany about the woman allowing the germans to set her up with a driver whose car was bugged german news media reported she told the driver about leaving her home in northwestern germany in august 2014 and making her way through turkey and syria to iraq once she arrived prosecutors said she joined the islamic state and swiftly rose through the ranks becoming a member of the hisbah the morality police patrolling the parks of the iraqi cities of falluja and mosul  deutsche bank and commerzbank germany s two largest lenders said on sunday that they had begun merger discussions in what analysts see as a last ditch effort to create a national champion that can compete with the giant american investment banks in a statement deutsche bank said that its board would explore strategic options meant to shore up its growth and profitability and commerzbank confirmed the merger talks both lenders cautioned that the talks may not lead to a deal the idea of merging the two firms has gained support in recent months within each bank and with the german government after previous rounds of talks over the years failed the combined bank would have 2 trillion in assets and be the third largest lender in europe behind hsbc holdings in britain and bnp paribas of france together deutsche bank and commerzbank would have about one fifth of the private customers in germany in theory giving them enough critical mass to be profitable in the country s overcrowded retail banking market  but because of the often eclectic mix of beautiful prewar buildings leipzig has several examples of bauhaus more functional german democratic republic blocks and newly built post reunification buildings neighborhoods mostly stay mixed large scale gentrification which occurred in the prenzlauer berg district in what was east berlin is still a ways off mr köngeter says that the boom is best documented by the cost of empty lots the result of bombs during the war or communist era houses in such poor repair that they had to be torn down after reunification for a while such lots had virtually no value but recently they have been sold for millions to investors planning to build condominiums according to market research provided by ivd the price for such lots has gone up 212 percent in the last five years many who say berlin is just too expensive now come to us mr köngeter said markkleeberg and other villages south of leipzig are also getting attention the towns were at the edge of some of the largest open pit coal mines in the region when the destruction of the landscape stopped with the fall of east germany those living closest to the pits had won the lottery after billions of euros of cleanup the pits were converted into large lakes and the lakefront land became some of the most expensive real estate in the region private real estate in east germany didn t exist as such before 1990 property was state owned and virtually everyone rented or received housing from their employer a problem for young families who were raised in eastern germany is that their parents can t help them with down payment or financing the way many do in the west mr kluge said in a telephone conversation because their parents were never able to buy property or otherwise amass wealth so the couple had to finance the nearly 700 000 price themselves although their unit is not yet finished the family has spent a lot of time thinking about how to style their apartment how to make best use of the light and of the two windows facing the elbe where mr kluge hopes to be able to sail a dinghy he plans to keep his big sailboat on the baltic sea roughly four and a half hours by road from leipzig in all the places we ve lived we realize what really counts is not so much the house itself but where it is mr kluge said  berlin germany which had already announced that it will fall significantly short of nato s defense spending goals annoying the united states risks provoking washington further by failing to reach even its own slimmed down target chancellor angela merkel s government had a falling out with the trump administration last year when it said that despite signing a commitment to work toward spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense by 2024 its target would instead be 1 5 percent now projected spending levels are expected to fall below even that lower path in a three year budget plan due to be announced on wednesday portending another confrontation with washington the timing could not be worse with nato preparing to celebrate its 70th anniversary in washington in april  berlin a simmering linguistic controversy has flared up in germany with a group of more than 70 influential figures publishing an appeal against the use of gender neutral terms the group issued the letter on wednesday on an accompanying petition they said they were responding in part to a recent decision by the city of hanover to officially adopt language practices including the so called gender star an asterisk that invites readers to choose between gendered spellings the so called gender neutral language is first based on a general error second produces a wealth of ridiculous linguistic structures and third cannot be sustained consistently the signatories who include writers lawyers journalists teachers linguists and a former head of germany s domestic intelligence agency assert this whole contortion of the language leads to something that is illegible and hard to understand said oliver baer the managing director of verein deutsche sprache an organization that describes itself as dedicated to promoting the use of german claims about 34 000 members and helped to write and distribute the letter  washington the rules based order of multilateralism is increasingly under threat and leaders must uphold international cooperation german finance minister olaf scholz said in washington on friday calling on the united states to overcome trade differences with europe u s president donald trump s threat this week to impose tariffs on 11 billion 8 4 billion worth of european union products including commercial aircraft has opened a new front in his global trade war and deepened a long running transatlantic subsidy dispute surrounding boeing and airbus the u s government is also mulling higher import tariffs on european cars on grounds that they are posing a threat to the national security of the country the move would particularly hurt the german economy and its huge car industry speaking at a forum at the peterson institute on the sidelines of the spring meetings of the international monetary fund and world bank scholz said both the united states and the eu had been advocates of open and fair trade for decades  berlin a german museum dedicated to sausages has stirred an unexpected controversy in announcing its new location a site where prisoners of a concentration camp were once used as slave labor for the nazi war machine the german bratwurst museum announced on wednesday that it would be moving complete with a cannon with a giant sausage in place of its barrel to an industrial lot in mühlhausen a small city near the geographical center of germany hours later it emerged that the same site had been during world war ii a satellite of the buchenwald concentration camp with a munitions factory that used forced labor most of those who lived there were jewish women from poland and hungary who had been transported from auschwitz of course we are upset about it said reinhard schramm who leads a jewish community group in the state of thuringia  berlin a day after a bus plunged off a road on the portuguese island of madeira killing 29 tourists possibly all germans chancellor angela merkel of germany said she was saddened and distressed by the accident as her nation awaited word of the victims identities the portuguese foreign ministry said on thursday that all those killed had been german citizens but berlin said it could not yet confirm that information the german government took the unusual step of readying a medical evacuation plane however and will send the foreign minister heiko maas to help determine how many of the victims were german the german ambassador to portugal christof weil also traveled to madeira on thursday morning ahead of mr maas to assist with the

conference that included representatives of german industry both men said there was no formal deal but they exuded relief that at least one point of conflict had been eased analysts say a terminal for liquefied natural gas on germany s northern shore where the port would be built is probably superfluous terminals in belgium the netherlands and poland can pump gas into germany s network and are

president trump s trade war into stark relief germany s economy did not grow at all in the year s final quarter and it barely avoided sliding into recession the government statistics agency said one

ignored last year berlin s state museums returned nine artifacts to indigenous groups in alaska the artifacts which came from a burial site were not taken from a german colony but the return of the
