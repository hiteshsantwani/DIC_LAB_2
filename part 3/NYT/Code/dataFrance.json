jacques de guillebon the editor of a new right wing magazine l incorrect credits zemmour with being the first to speak about immigration publicly without a complex fifteen 20 years ago in france you didn t have the right de guillebon told me he influenced a lot of people who didn t dare to think what they were thinking france has long had its own version of the free speech wars that have roiled the united states with one notable difference the law there is no french equivalent of the first amendment instead france has strict hate speech statutes which can be applied at the discretion of investigating judges zemmour has spent hundreds of hours and thousands of euros going to court to defend himself against charges of inciting racial hatred in 2014 he told an italian newspaper that muslims have their own civil code which is the quran he was fined 3 000 euros though the charges were later dropped in 2016 he stated on tv that jihadists were considered to be good muslims by all muslims he was fined 5 000 euros a number of other cases were ultimately dismissed evidence to his supporters that french institutions are controlled by the left or by a cabal of the liberal left and the establishment right zemmour found new fodder for his battle with leftist elites in mid november when 280 000 french protesters calling themselves the gilets jaunes or yellow vests demonstrated across the country against a tax increase on diesel fuel president emmanuel macron had announced the tax as part of france s climate change policy creating a strange predicament for urban liberals normally they would support a working class movement against the mechanisms of power but the gilets jaunes were protesting at least initially a policy liberals hold dear zemmour did not miss his chance to underscore this contradiction and skewer his opponents remarking that the gilets jaunes were a french manifestation of a global phenomenon you have the real french real italians real english real americans who live in this periphery farther and farther away from the centers where wealth is created he said in an interview for the news channel bfmtv that s the heart of this debate and in the name of environmentalism an ideology that comes from the cities we make the only people who actually need their cars those on the peripheries pay for the most expensive gasoline macron is the incarnation of this metropolitan france which elected him normally we don t hear la france périphérique in the media who speak only the language of metropolitan france here the periphery is making itself heard as the protests continued to dominate the news cycle blocked roads vandalized businesses and monuments tear gas filling the champs élysées zemmour wrote and spoke incessantly on the topic ultimately he declared macron s mandate dead zemmour isn t just contemptuous of political correctness but seemingly entirely unaffected by the constraint it can breed zemmour has this journalist s eye for the underreported thing the good angle gobry said he s very very good at just noting facts at just saying this is happening gobry pointed to the work zemmour alluded to in the bfmtv interview la france périphérique a seminal 2014 study by the french geographer christophe guilluy about the lower middle class in rural and exurban parts of the country it showed how the accumulation of economic resources in urban centers hollowed out their prospects guilluy s a card carrying member of the left and a card carrying member of academia so now everybody is allowed to say what he s saying gobry told me but zemmour was saying it before zemmour s newest book french destiny is in some ways a response to the surprisingly successful world history of france compiled and edited by the noted historian patrick boucheron and published the year before where boucheron presents french history as a product of diverse ethnic and geographical influences zemmour adheres to thomas carlyle s dictum that history is but the biography of great men the most powerful win and rightly so for zemmour the strict hierarchical social order born of catholicism divorced from the church and joined with the principles of roman law is what gives french society its unique structure the significance of zemmour s evangelism for the catholic culture of france turns on the fact that he is jewish and of algerian descent in french destiny zemmour writes for the first time about his family and childhood i think that we are the children of a generation even more than we are the children of our parents zemmour told me french destiny was the top seller on french amazon for weeks and he had been doing nonstop publicity appearances by the time i finally sat down with him in a cafe on the boulevard haussmann not far from le figaro s offices he ordered a tea and stirred some orange marmalade into it to soothe his throat nursing a cold he caught the week before in my generation we were french we appropriated french history people coming from every horizon became french he said in his new book he wanted to show how history was the vector of assimilation éric justin léon zemmour was born in a paris suburb in 1958 his parents descendants of berber jews came to paris from algeria in the 1950s during the french algerian war zemmour tells of his grandfather s showing him an old postage stamp bearing a turbaned fighter holding a gun his family name which means olive tree in berber is blazoned across the top according to zemmour the berber tribe to which his family belonged resisted the french invaders before embracing them the gauls became gallo roman after having a taste of roman peace and civilization zemmour writes my ancestors became berbero french after tasting french peace and civilization his passion for his family s adoptive land feels almost american except zemmour insists they were not immigrants the crémieux decree of 1870 made algerian jews but not algerian muslims french citizens they had migrated not immigrated zemmour spent his early childhood years in drancy a northeast suburb of paris his father roger an ambulance driver liked to listen to lili boniche one of the greats of the chanson judeo arabe while his mother lucette sang along to charles aznavour in 1969 his parents moved to the chateau rouge neighborhood of the 18th arrondissement in paris where his father could speak arabic in the cafes and where he also liked to gamble but zemmour writes i did not in any way grow up in the cult of the algeria of my father zemmour has never been to algeria my parents families were poor even destitute and they weren t sad about what they d left behind they d left nothing france was life algeria was nostalgia france was the great nation algeria the little homeland  hate the rising tide of anti semitism in france and what it means for us by marc weitzmann anti semitism is rising throughout the western world a byproduct of the nationalist nativist wave that has targeted cosmopolitan globalized elites as culprits for growing inequality and cultural alienation jews know all about that cosmopolitan thing they also know about the power of myth conspiratorial slurs have never multiplied as fast as in the age of social media things do not have to be true marc weitzmann writes in hate they just need to be transmitted as many times as possible the protocols of the elders of zion has found in technology a powerful multiplier as have various forms of islamophobia in europe where the israeli palestinian conflict spills over another gaza war another synagogue desecrated the anti semitic surge has been particularly marked france home to the continent s largest jewish and muslim communities cradle of the declaration of the rights of man and of the emancipation of the jews in 1791 has been its epicenter even the yellow vest protests of the marginalized have not been immune go back to tel aviv demonstrators yelled recently at the prominent french essayist alain finkielkraut the slaughter of jewish children at an orthodox school in toulouse in 2012 the terrorist attack on a kosher supermarket in a paris suburb in 2015 and the brutal murder in 2018 of mireille knoll a holocaust survivor form a trail of horror weitzmann in this impassioned book that swirls sometimes chaotically from personal to historical reflections sets out to understand the reasons for the scourge and to cut through what he sees as persistent french obfuscation of it the author is from a secular french jewish family at the age of 30 he gets himself circumcised and has a bar mitzvah weitzmann asks himself is this an act of madness or an affirmation of jewish identity he says he is unsure but seems to provide the answer by saying he would do it

the elite club of 40 immortals as the members are known that serves as the official guardian of the french language does not admit just anybody so exclusive is it that most of france s greatest writers never made it but the sacred job of protecting france from brainless globish and the deadly snobbery of anglo american as a member spat out in a speech last month has rarely been more

who midway through the film receives a diagnosis for a possible lung infection doesn t look like he is in enviable health but in both conception and conclusion the movie takes a pie eyed view of leo s ostensible wildness as if living on the streets drug addiction and charging money for sex were just radical expressions of liberty vidal naquet sells this facile notion by keeping his protagonist a borderline cipher even tempered accommodating seemingly at peace with drifting it s tough to build a character study around an unconvincing character  yet the gilets jaunes and france as a whole which largely backed them deserve no less this protest movement unlike a number of others across europe hasn t devolved into nationalism or populism yes it is somewhat skewed toward political extremes notably the far right yes it has had some ugly lapses notably anti semitic incidents and the violence displayed by some participants or free riders as well as the occasional brutality of the police forces has increasingly overshadowed the substance of the movement on social fiscal and institutional issues but at bottom the gilets jaunes have steadily pointed out valid concerns and suggested reforms that deserve a full hearing like raising the lowest incomes and the minimum wage reinforcing state services in disaffected areas adjusting retirement pensions to inflation and introducing some forms of popular referendum in mid december after a long period of uncertainty mr macron did make concessions that were major and costly in more ways than one a spate of social measures worth up to 10 billion euros was announced even though the expense will bog down the national budget and risks turning france into a bad pupil of the european union the protests were sparked in part by a rise in gasoline prices and when mr macron later backtracked on that increase and some of his government s green measures he undercut france s efforts to cast itself as a world leader in the fight against climate change then came the grand débat after a chaotic start thousands of meetings took place throughout the country in an inevitable reference to the french revolution of 1789 local authorities collected cahiers de doléances books of grievances by late february more than a million proposals had been submitted online on a dedicated site robots algorithms and other digital tools are supposed to analyze all the input the effort has been amply criticized some people question whether the data can be processed properly other complaints more politically driven accuse the government of having staged all this in the service of its campaign for the european elections in may but two other points are more worrisome still the first is that this nationwide debate won t have allowed the gilets jaunes to really express themselves it s true that even at the height of the protests the movement was representative of only some parts of french society mostly the residents of towns and rural areas that are depopulating working class and lower middle class people who struggle to make ends meet car drivers for whom gasoline prices are critical the movement did not really represent say the unemployed residents of large cities or major suburbs or students  olson writes with verve and a historian s authority fourcade she tells us was beautiful and liked men but she was obsessed with defeating the despised boches a master of disguises she frequently changed her hair color and sometimes used distorting dentures and other theatrical tricks image her personal life was even by french standards complicated fourcade was married with two young children she didn t see for years at a time her estranged husband is barely mentioned before long however she fell in love with a french air force pilot leon faye who joined her network as her deputy even after she became pregnant with faye s child she continued to take jaw dropping risks fourcade s treatment of her children struck me as shockingly cold olson s narrative might have been tighter had it focused on fewer and more fleshed out characters in a long list of dramatis personae worthy of a russian novel one of the more memorable is fourcade s agent jeannie rousseau a 20 year old recent graduate of the prestigious école libre des sciences politiques rousseau like her boss benefited from men underestimating her when the germans set up their brittany headquarters rousseau who spoke fluent german applied for a job as a translator remarkably careless around this pretty young woman the wehrmacht officers peppered their conversations with two strange words peenemu nde and raketten in answer to jeannie s seemingly innocent query an officer showed her a drawing of a rocket and a testing station on an island off the baltic coast peenemünde rousseau s report on this exchange was an astonishing piece of intelligence it revealed to the allies the existence of a new superweapon the v2 rocket in late 1942 200 000 wehrmacht troops marched unopposed into the former vichy governed free zone now with the gestapo in full charge fourcade was often mortally afraid reluctantly she accepted evacuation to london where she found a different but still vicious war between two titanic exiled french leaders charles de gaulle and henri giraud fourcade refused to be drawn into this internecine battle and made herself suspect in the eyes of many french exiles by working too closely with the british collaborating with british intelligence confronted fourcade with a familiar challenge sexism when the head of mi6 cmdr claude dansey first met fourcade he behaved with exaggerated gallantry presenting her with a bouquet and remarking so this is the terrible woman who has had us all scared though anxious to return to her agents in france fourcade was told essentially not to worry her pretty little head you ve gone on long past the safety limits the englishman admonished her according to the law of averages an underground leader can t last more than six months you ve lasted over two and a half years it s sheer witchcraft as olson relates behind her back he referred to her as cohen s bitch a reference to fourcade s close friend cmdr kenneth cohen the mi6 official in charge of french intelligence during the war fourcade eventually returned to france and to her agents in the field awaiting capture by the gestapo expecting torture and execution fourcade requested permission from a priest to take the cyanide pills she carried suicide being a mortal sin in her catholic faith she shouldn t have any scruples about this the priest assured her it would not be suicide but instead a means of resisting the enemy but as always she survived living to the age of 79 dying in 1989 will the brutal nazi occupation of europe ever stop churning up new material probably not nor should we ever cease our attempt to fathom two unfathomable questions regarding the 20th century just how did hitler nearly fulfill his murderous vision and why did so few resist his monstrous plans marie madeleine fourcade certainly did and with this gripping tale lynne olson pays her what history has so far denied her france slow to confront the stain of vichy would do well to finally honor a fighter most of us would want in our foxhole  there has never been a fashion show inside the cathedral of notre dame or in

the city s main squares where people had been camping out it was cold and raining mr etchegaray said we couldn t leave them there anymore they were cold sick and hungry the mayor formed plans for the initiative quickly he came directly to the square ms etcheverry recalled adding that she remembered him saying i ll be back in a half hour when he returned he led volunteers and migrants to an underground parking lot for the municipal police a temporary solution until something better could be found he accompanied them and showed them where the toilets were ms etcheverry recounted he saw that they were quiet and that we were just young people helping other young people but we never imagined that it would end like this in a center financed by the municipality it is a mayor s duty mr etchegaray said the state just doesn t want to know he added but me i ve got to know and this was an emergency  get the dealbook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines and the power brokers who shape them  emmanuel macron s victory over the far right national front party in the french presidential election came only a few months after the ascension of donald j trump to the presidency of the united states and less than a year after britain voted to leave the european union the outcome installing a centrist leader elicited a mixture of euphoria and relief from the establishment a cnbc com headline from the day captured this emotion phew world reacts as macron becomes next french president those hoping that mr macron s election would reverse the tide of nationalist and authoritarian leaders coming to power were disappointed to learn that his domestic popularity was fleeting anyone still rooting for a macron comeback was rudely awakened by the scale and ferocity of the yellow vest movement whose mass demonstrations began in november one of the few consistent demands of the protesters has been the resignation of president macron the author christophe guilluy who describes himself as a geographer although he mostly served as a housing consultant after graduating from college in 1987 has concerned himself with the growing cultural and economic fissures animating the recent protests he has written four books on the topic since 2010 and the third of these originally published in 2016 has just been translated by yale university press as twilight of the elites prosperity the periphery and the future of france despite the hectoring tone unfounded generalizations and conspiratorial allusions the book still manages to provide an indispensable guide to understanding the fears and frustrations of an increasingly permanent underclass not just in france but throughout the world  but the endless hours of meeting with local officials often with mr macron doing most of talking may have more successfully bludgeoned the yellow vests into submission than any number of riot police only 22 300 people marched in the yellow vest protest across france saturday the lowest turnout yet and less than a tenth of those who took part in the first marches on nov 17 last year and only about 35 percent of the french still support them less than half the figure at the movement s peak mr macron by going week after week deep into the country and standing for hours on end lecturing and taking questions has clawed back some of the popularity he lost at the height of the yellow vest movement he is now supported by some 29 percent of the french according to an ifop poll last week around his level of support at the beginning of the protests after weeks of trailing marine le pen s far right rassemblement national party formerly the national front in polls for may s elections to the european parliament mr macron has finally crept out in front renewing dialogue and deflating the anger in one sense he s succeeded said chloé morin a public opinion expert at the ipsos consultancy in paris but it was just one part of the french who participated in the great national debate said ms morin it was a certain category of the population and not necessarily a representative one city dwellers those who are reasonably off so it s been a relative success she said he s managed to regain his base of popularity with his electorate and with the right but the large segment of the population that once identified with the yellow vests is another matter  berlin times are rough for the european union the news coming from britain grows more depressing every day italy is governed by a maverick government searching for an open confrontation with france hungary and poland are slowly slipping into authoritarianism and we are headed for a european election in may that could result in further gains by populist parties it is tempting then to see a ray of hope in an agreement by germany and france announced on friday for a eurozone budget which the two countries will present to their fellow member states maybe after years of delay paris and berlin are finally taking the initiative to reverse europe s seemingly unstoppable slow motion disintegration not so fast this latest deal aside france and germany both founding powers of the european union and its most powerful members have been growing increasingly at odds the discord is driven in part by differences over concrete policy proposals but the bigger intractable problem is a fundamental difference in their visions for europe this being europe the two countries have done their best to paper over their differences with rhetorical displays of unity in november french president emmanuel macron stood on the floor of the german bundestag to deliver a speech marking the 100th anniversary of the end of world war i not holding back he described the franco german relationship as one of love a love born of the many catastrophes of the 20th century on jan 22 the two countries even renewed their vows so to speak by signing an update to the 1963 elysée treaty which announced a new era of comity between the two former enemies  alcohol is a principal cause of avoidable death in france the agency warned no wine is the opposite of death the producers answered it is about three essential elements of french life they said liberty fraternity and the pursuit of pleasure look we agree with the moderation aspect but on the other hand we always feel that they re picking on wine said maurin bérenger a well respected producer of the rich dark cahors wine in southwest france even limiting it this is a constraint on liberty he said the wine that we re producing and that we champion it s to be consumed for pleasure with moderation and not to get drunk said mr bérenger he is one of thousands of wine producers in one of the bibles of french life le guide hachette des vins which tells you just about everything you need to know before you drink regions grapes pairing french wine consumption has had its ups and downs even without the public health warning in the last half century it has declined by about 50 percent according to vin et société a consortium of wine industry actors the old culture of the workman sidling up to the bar in the local cafe at 10 a m and demanding his small glass of red wine or petit rouge is far less prevalent if it still exists at all but a prewar marketing slogan still captures the essential spirit of wine s place in french culture wine is the sacred foodstuff that alights the fire of the french soul  paris plans by a major sporting goods company in france to sell a hijab designed for runners have incited yet another debate over what muslim women wear exposing once again the tensions between secularism and religion in the country france s longstanding attitudes toward feminism secularism and the integration of immigrants are at the root of the many controversies but they are also fueled by recent fears about islamist terrorism along with the rise of social media the most recent debate centers on plans by decathlon europe s largest sporting goods retailer to sell the hijab which covers the wearer s head and neck criticism quickly came from many quarters with one lawmaker saying that the debate laid bare this obsession around the veil and islam what is the decathlon controversy decathlon had started selling the sports hijab in morocco last week and planned to do so in france the move was quickly criticized on social media and several politicians expressed discomfort about the product being sold in france  in the ansm letter this week which the french newspaper le monde published

implantation is likely to constitute nearly 500 000 women have breast implants in france in 2018 macro textured and polyurethane implants represented 27 percent of sales according to the ansm over the past five years some 70 000 women are thought to have received the implants which do not slip out of place or rotate unlike smooth ones they are also less likely than smooth ones to cause thick scarring around the implant which is common and requires more surgery joëlle manighetti a french activist who started a blog on breast implants after suffering from faulty ones praised the decision as going beyond our recommendations i now hope that there will be a serious follow up of the other breast implants still on the market she said breast implants came under scrutiny in france in the last

and luigi di maio both deputy prime ministers of italy had said that they gave their full support to the gilets jaunes yellow vests who have been protesting throughout france for weeks rattling the presidency of emmanuel macron then after meeting representatives of the movement a few days ago mr di maio declared that a new europe is being born the french foreign ministry called the statement yet more provocation and manipulation for electoral aims italy s two headed government an opportunistic alliance between the extreme right league of mr salvini and the populist anti establishment five star movement of mr di maio has made a sport of going after france especially mr macron mr di maio in particular has called out france s supposedly neocolonialist relationship with its former

unfounded said the paris police prefecture several mayors issued statements to soothe worried parents the ubiquity of social media and instant messaging apps has made such rumors quicker to spread

have been deadly dozens were killed in india last year by mobs after false rumors about child kidnappers went viral on whatsapp the messaging app owned by facebook similar rumors have led to lynchings

spokesman until he resigned on wednesday to pursue a run for paris mayor said that this week s violence was detestable and showed the absolute necessity to fight against fake news france passed a contentious law last year to counter the manipulation of information but it is meant mainly for electoral races giving candidates the possibility to ask judges to block content deemed false during a three month period preceding an election for instance another bill set to be discussed in parliament in may will outline new rules to fight hate speech online but it is not specifically intended to stop rumors from spreading over the internet french law already makes it illegal to spread false news with offenders facing a fine of 45 000 euros or more than 50 000  in his informative book fromages

online insult mockery and harassment aimed at women in the business now with confirmation that a group that called itself the ligue du lol existed it is a moment of reckoning about sexism in the french news media an insular and still male dominated industry in a country where the metoo movement has met with some resistance some of the men behind the group whose name means the league of lol have issued apologies and several have been suspended from their jobs in one case a member of the group made a pornographic photo montage of a feminist writer and circulated it on twitter in another a member of the group made a prank phone call to a woman pretending to be a media executive with a job offer and then put the conversation online  the official who said he was not authorized to speak publicly about an investigation while it was in process said that the employee whose name has not been made public was in his 30s and worked for the city s international relations department on the

diplomatic representative in paris since 2009 and he has regularly attended the ceremony during which the mayor meets with religious leaders and the diplomatic corps but the city hall official said this was the first time a city employee had complained about the archbishop s behavior the employee accused archbishop ventura of touching his buttocks on three occasions the official said first when the vatican envoy arrived at city hall greeting him and complimenting him on his physical appearance the employee said he thought the gesture might have been involuntary according to the official but the archbishop touched the man s buttocks a second time several minutes later this time more forcefully according to the official who said there was no more doubt for the employee that this act was voluntary the employee sought to distance himself from the archbishop going to another room but the archbishop followed him and touched his buttocks a third time the official said in that instance four other city hall employees were witnesses  paris the authorities here said on monday that the french film director luc besson would face no charges after a nine month inquiry into an actress s accusations that he had raped her an official at the paris prosecutor s office who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with official policy said that numerous investigations by the paris police couldn t show that mr besson 59 had coerced the dutch belgian actress sand van roy into unwanted sex ms van roy a 28 year old actress who filed a lawsuit against mr besson in may and a second one in july accused him of raping her on at least four occasions and said he once injured her to the point of bleeding in an interview with the new york times in july she described a two year long abusive relationship with mr besson and said she was afraid to turn down his advances out of fear that it would hurt her career according to the first lawsuit ms van roy told the police in may on the day after the sexual contact that she said made her bleed i m afraid he might kill me he is a psychopath  belgium abstained because the regional government of wallonia a french speaking area in the south viewed the negotiations much like france according to a belgian diplomat who declined to speak on the record given the continuing negotiations in 2016 wallonia temporarily blocked the ratification of a free trade deal between the european union and canada on both protectionist and environmentalist grounds the two negotiation mandates were first proposed in january by the european commission which negotiates trade deals for the bloc s 28 member states last year mr trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum produced in the european union the european union retaliated with tariffs on a list of goods imported from the united states in july leaders on both sides called a truce during a meeting in washington and vowed to work toward a free trade agreement however congress has made clear that it will not ratify any trade agreement with the european union that doesn t include agriculture and the trump administration has repeatedly insisted that agriculture be included in later negotiations something that european countries including france have forcefully resisted meanwhile the united states has been threatening to impose punitive tariffs on european car imports peter chase a former united states trade representative in brussels and currently a resident senior fellow at the german marshall fund said the u s administration is trying to push europeans to adopt a negotiating mandate using the threat of the auto tariffs to ensure that mandate is broad and includes agriculture the u s will push and the e u will push back i do think that it is possible that the u

political fortunes and economic plans  paris a new task force in france has been given a broader mandate to search for and return artwork that had been looted or sold under duress during the nazi occupation after years of criticism that its restitution efforts were not proactive enough the task force announced last year and starting work in the coming weeks will primarily look at artwork in france that is already suspected of having been looted during world war ii to try to return it to the original owners or their heirs but in a step up from current policy it will also try to determine whether any other pieces acquired by french institutions have dubious origins though those are only expected to represent a small fraction of france s vast national art collections we are not starting from nothing but we are amplifying the work david zivie a culture ministry official who is expected to lead the new task force said in an interview  boulogne sur mer france there is disquiet along the

strolls along the seine had gone pretty smoothly until it was time to go back to london on monday he experienced a flavor of france s protest culture combined with a taste of brexit when his eurostar train was delayed for two hours at the gare du nord the wait was caused by a french customs officers protest against what they see as france s lack of preparation ahead of britain s exit from the european union i am not sure that we in britain are as worried as the french customs officers about brexit mr kirkwood 68 said maybe we should stop drinking tea and start thinking about what comes next as britain prepares for another crucial vote on tuesday about the withdrawal customs workers on the other side of the english channel have been showing what might happen without extra funding and staffing ahead of the march 29 deadline they say the ports train stations and tunnel linking britain and france will face mayhem  still french journalists and their supporters saw the move as new proof of the adversarial stance toward the media of mr macron who recently faced pushback after deciding to move the press room outside of the élysée palace the seat of the presidency journalists at dozens of publications issued a statement this week expressing solidarity with our colleagues at mediapart the national union of journalists referring to the attempted raid and to laws passed this year on the protection of trade secrets and on so called fake news described it as worrying that journalists duty to inform can be flouted in this way in france in 2019 the episode was the latest of many tied to mr benalla who was fired last summer as a security aide to mr macron after it was revealed he had hit a protester at a may 1 demonstration once billed the most serious threat to mr macron the benalla affair died down and was eclipsed in france s news cycle by the yellow vest economic protests against the president until a steady stream of news reports in recent weeks raised questions about how the élysée had handled the earlier case and whether mr benalla had used his ties to the presidency to obtain business contracts in the audio recordings which date to july and which mediapart published last week as part of a wider investigation mr benalla can be heard discussing the case against him with vincent crase who had also worked on security for the élysée and for mr macron s party

would be the latest turn in a swift stunning fall from grace for mr ghosn a larger than life car industry figure who forged a global business empire that bound renault nissan and mitsubishi motors together in what was known as the alliance the public push for mr ghosn s removal from renault came after senior french officials flew to tokyo after the tuesday bail hearing martin vial one of two

where size provides a crucial advantage in a nod to the importance of scale ford motor and volkswagen outlined on monday what they hope will become their own broad alliance to speed the development of electric and self driving cars potentially creating competition for the renault nissan mitsubishi alliance on that front nissan and mitsubishi removed mr ghosn from their boards immediately after his initial arrest on nov 19 but renault and the french government have maintained that he had a presumption of innocence privately though succession plans were being prepared in case of a prolonged detention because mr ghosn still faces a long trial in japan he cannot carry out his executive functions  ever since the italian entrepreneur oscar farinetti opened the first eataly in torino 12 years ago he s dreamed of bringing his italian marketplace to paris but he would have to perfect the concept in 37 other locations from tokyo to las vegas before this dream would become a reality the french consumer is mature and fanatical about food said mr farinetti 64 last month at eataly paris marais which is to open to the public in mid april they understand artisanal products they know wine and

galeries lafayette retail group mr farinetti is convinced he and his three sons who run the business with him have the right offerings to appeal to local tastes what can visitors expect from the paris shop i like to say that eataly is like one big family with 39 children same father different character in this case we honor france s spirit of fraternity its bistro culture and its close ties to italy we re cousins half of our staff will be italian half will be french in other destinations 90 percent of the staff is local not italian and we ll have great italian wines but 10 percent of the

france really left behind decades of deep involvement in african politics france s foreign minister this week defended the strikes against chadian rebels before a handful of puzzled members of parliament who wondered why the country was again propping up an ironhanded african dictator albeit one whose relatively efficient military is considered vital in the fight against terrorists french officials have brushed aside these qualms insisting that it was mr déby himself who invited the french the strikes took place between feb 3 and 6 destroying 20 rebel pickup trucks and stopping a rebel

office worker at the rally with her daughter i m scared for the future of the jews it s not easy being a jew now  it is no secret that the french telegraphic service treated the public with scant courtesy during the war delivering despatches when and to whom it pleased but the extent of its abuses as elicited by the committee appointed by the chamber of deputies to investigate into state contracts during the war will nevertheless astonish everybody this investigation the results of which are published in the temps shows that the telegraphic control section of which m tannery was the head and captain ladoux and m pierre lenoir were active members was responsible for scandalous abuses for instance in the course of the investigation m tannery recognized that on an average at the paris telegraph bureau 40 000 despatches were held back daily the majority of them were never delivered and the others were distributed after great delay the despatches which were retained were in the main thrown into a basket and when the accumulation had become too great they were destroyed the control section never made any inquiry and neither the senders or those to whom the despatches were addressed were ever informed it must be admitted that these telegraph authorities were no respecters of persons telegrams sent by or to foreign sovereigns princes and diplomatists were treated like the despatches of tom dick or harry in fact the close attention and all the patience of the delegation of foreign affairs was needed to prevent the systematic holding up of these state telegrams  in france complex criminal cases are handled by special magistrates with broad investigative powers who place defendants under formal investigation when they believe the evidence points to serious wrongdoing but the magistrates can later drop the charges if they do not believe the evidence is sufficient to proceed to trial in 2016 french prosecutors said they had uncovered more than 2 million in payments made by tokyo s bidding committee to a little known singaporean company black tidings during the competition to host the 2020 olympics that company was found to belong to a close friend of mr diack s the japanese authorities at the request of their french counterparts questioned mr takeda about those payments in 2017 but have taken no action since officials said the payments were for consulting work and a panel commissioned by the japanese olympic committee said in 2016 that it had found that the payments were legitimate it was unclear whether the japanese committee would reopen is investigation in light of the french charges calls to the committee went unanswered late friday tokyo beat out rivals madrid and istanbul to win the summer olympics for the first time since 1964 back then the olympics symbolized japan s recovery from world war ii similarly organizers in japan had seen the 2020 games as a chance to show the world that their country was bouncing back from the devastating march 2011 tsunami and the nuclear disaster at fukushima now suggestions that corruption played a role in japan s triumph have cast a pall over the preparations the former prime minister yoshiro mori who leads the tokyo olympics organizing committee told the fuji news network that he was simply shocked by france s move the organizing committee was set up jointly by the japanese olympic committee and the tokyo metropolitan government and mr takeda serves as one of its vice presidents perhaps perceptions differ from those of japan and i hope this is a mistake mr mori said mr takeda is the second olympic luminary to face serious legal action in recent months in november sheikh ahmed al sabah a member of kuwait s royal family and close ally of the i o c president thomas

but even as france paid tribute on thursday to the firefighters who saved the structure and its relics there was a growing debate about how the gothic landmark should be rebuilt workers are still focused largely on shoring up the damaged structure but how closely the planned reconstruction should adhere to the original design and materials has become a point of contention in a nation long accustomed to arguing over the balance between modernity and cultural heritage president emmanuel macron gave the debate particular urgency when he said the cathedral would be rebuilt within five years a time frame that some experts have called too optimistic some of mr macron s political opponents have even accused him of wanting to rush the restoration in order to have the cathedral ready in time for the 2024 olympic games which will be held in paris franck riester the french culture minister said on thursday that the government would strive to meet the timeline set out by the president but he also cautioned that rebuilding the cathedral could take more time  paris a high profile french jihadist and islamic state propagandist fabien clain who is believed to have recorded the islamic

on sunday that he wanted to create a national day of commemoration for the 1994 genocide in rwanda which has been a longstanding source of tension between the two countries mr macron said in a statement that he wanted to create a national day of remembrance on april 7 the date 25 years ago that rwanda s hutu majority began systematically massacring members of the tutsi minority leaving an estimated 800 000 to one million people dead on this day of commemoration for the 25th anniversary of the tutsi genocide in rwanda the president of the republic expresses his solidarity with the rwandan people and his compassion for the victims and their families the statement said rwanda led by president paul kagame has long accused france of complicity in the genocide and of helping some of the perpetrators escape poisoning ties between the two countries even though relations have warmed since mr macron s election in 2017  paris for months lydie and patrice maninchedda were met with silence when they pleaded with the french government to repatriate their three grandsons who were stranded in a kurdish controlled camp in northeastern syria after their mother had been reported killed but that silence came to an end on friday when an official told them that their grandchildren ages 1 3 and 5 were part of a small group of islamic state militants orphans who had been brought back to france we are their only remaining family and now they are our only reason to live said ms maninchedda whose daughter julie joined the islamic state in syria in 2014 and was reported killed in

of my children  the government has also introduced new legislation against sexist catcalling leading to a first conviction in september but the report published this week cautioned that the number of cases reported to the police was still far below the number of actual victims it pointed to surveys showing that on average from 2011 to 2017 only one out of eight victims of sexual violence filed a complaint with the authorities of the roughly 19 000 people in france who reported a rape to the police in 2018 nearly 90 percent were women and in about 30 percent of cases the perpetrator was a close family member the report said women were also overwhelmingly the targets of sexual assault representing over 80 percent of the roughly 28 000 victims who went to the police in france in 2018 the report said in ms spanton s case after encountering a group of police officers at a bar in april 2014 the officers invited her for a night tour of 36 quai des orfèvres a police building frequently depicted in movies and television shows ms spanton said that she was then forced to drink more alcohol and that she was gang raped several times ms spanton filed a complaint immediately but after an investigation that put her through multiple psychological reviews in 2016 a panel of investigative judges ruled that there was not enough evidence to proceed to trial that decision was overturned on appeal the following year at trial the defense questioned ms spanton s credibility by cross examining her about her clothes her alcohol consumption and her past use of drugs the prosecution argued that dna testing and phone records supported her account and dismissed the claim that ms spanton had been flirting with the police officers at the bar as irrelevant one can kiss at 10 p m and refuse to have sexual relations at 1 a m the prosecutor philippe courroye said in his closing arguments ms spanton s lawyer sophie obadia hailed the officers convictions as proof that france where some have regarded the metoo movement with skepticism was moving past an outdated view of sexual violence at last in france it is considered that a woman who was raped does not have to explain herself about her private life ms obadia told reporters at the central paris courthouse after the two officers were found guilty the court found that ms spanton had not lied was not a mythomaniac and it based its ruling on the objective evidence of the case which is not her word against the word of the accused  paris the french police have arrested a prominent leader of the yellow vest movement for a second time in a clear sign that the government is following through on a pledge to crack down on the protests that have shaken france for much of the past six weeks éric drouet a 33 year old truck driver

another episode of anguished national soul searching over the problem of persistent anti semitism in france and the evolution of the yellow vest movement from gas tax protest to violent street revolt with hints of menace and hooliganism some politicians and intellectuals accused others of not condemning the insults to mr finkielkraut firmly enough president emmanuel macron telephoned him to express his anger but said he would not be attending a march in paris scheduled for tuesday to condemn anti semitism  jean michel blanquer the education minister says he wants to give arabic prestige as it is a great literary language while the ministry wants to promote the study of arabic and make classes more readily available it has not provided many details about the plan other than to say that arabic teaching will be strengthened alongside that of russian and chinese and most french schools will have to start their arabic programs from scratch only 0 2 percent of students in public middle and high schools in france took arabic classes in the 2017 2018 school year putting the language far behind the widely taught english spanish and german in addition to the pedagogical challenges of jump starting arabic programs in public schools there are social and political obstacles as well rime abdel nabi who teaches arabic at two public high schools as well as at sorbonne university in paris said public school principals were reluctant to open classes saying no we don t have enough arabs here or no we don t want to attract arabs the ministry s plans is causing

spurred by the yellow vest protests president emmanuel macron on tuesday kicked off what he intended as a peacemaking exercise and what the french government billed as the great national debate in a sort of two month talkfest the french are supposed to air their grievances all shepherded by the government and local mayors a cultural fondness for talk and more talk will get its consecration with the hope that calm will follow for the moment however france is anything but calm apart from the random violence and vandalism in the streets of paris and other french cities there have also been less evident and more targeted threats and violence in an atmosphere of increasing menace mr macron s deputies in parliament have become the front line proxies for yellow vest hatred of the president

sont importants apparemment lorsque le gouvernement autrichien expulsa une soixantaine d imams turcs l année dernière pour disait il contrer les sociétés parallèles et l islam politique la turquie a

une gestion coloniale de l islam l amalgame est malin évoquer la colonisation permet de négocier en jouant sur la culpabilisation tout en gardant à l islam un statut communautaire pourquoi on redoute

especially for the countries that use the common euro currency most of his lofty visions like a shared eurozone budget have been watered down or have come to nothing but ms merkel also wants to support him and his commitment to europe especially when he is in difficulty at home each leader acknowledged the challenges but drew on them as reasons for the new treaty seventy four years after the end of world war ii a lifetime things considered self evident are again being called into question ms merkel said in remarks before the signing that is why we need first a re establishment of the responsibility of germany and france within the european union and second a reorientation of our cooperation the new accord includes pledges to deepen economic integration through a joint economic zone and to reinforce cooperation in military purchasing and coordination with the aim of improving europe s ability to act on its own it includes a mutual defense pact within the context of nato membership and would establish a joint defense and security council both mr macron and ms merkel have called in their own ways for a european army capable of acting alone when nato does not wish to be involved both have also said that europe can no longer count on the united states as it has in the past that idea created anger and concern in washington and set off a series of contemptuous remarks over twitter from president trump europe is the protective shield for our people against the new storms in the world mr macron said  paris it has happened rarely between european union allies and not between france and italy since world war ii but on thursday after months of barbed commentary from italian leaders the french government said it had had enough it recalled its ambassador from rome this is without precedent since 1940 when mussolini declared war said marc lazar a specialist in franco italian relations who teaches at universities in paris and rome this is very very harsh there s never been anything comparable the protest not only demonstrated the breakdown of relations between france and italy founding members of the european union it also reflected the mounting strains at europe s core brought on by populists seeking to denigrate the bloc and forge anti european alliances across borders a clash that may play out even more bitterly in european parliament elections in may but now that the populists run the italian government europe s divided politics have been elevated to the level of diplomatic rancor  kigali rwanda the latest on the commemorations to mark the

following a surge of violence during yellow vest demonstrations over the weekend that led to intense criticism of the government s handling of security around tourist neighborhoods and wealthier areas prime minister édouard philippe said in a televised statement from paris that after intolerable events over the weekend the government had decided to ban any future yellow vest demonstrations in the areas that have been most targeted if authorities became aware of extremist elements that intended to vandalize mr philippe said one of those areas would be the champs élysées a major avenue in

michaud 41 who lives on france s western coast now joins demonstrations to protest both economic distress and police violence the government claims that we are looters and violent protesters but so many of us are just peaceful civilians said mr michaud a horticulturist who now wears an eye patch and says his arms were raised when he was shot the government isn t listening to us and now they are trying to silence us with repression in the streets anger at officers use of force has helped fuel the nationwide yellow vest movement that began as protests against a fuel tax increase and that has grown into a broader revolt against president emmanuel macron s government  notre dame has occupied the heart of paris for the better part of a millennium its twin medieval towers rising from the small central island wedged between the storied left and right banks now france is burning the fire at notre dame happened on the day that the country s troubled president emmanuel macron was supposed to explain how he intended to address the demands of the yellow vest movement an anguished restless nation has struggled to cope with the monthslong uprising and with the frayed social safety net that spurred the protests generations that had come to rely on this social safety net as a matter of national pride and identity see it going up in smoke on monday so was the cathedral which for centuries has enshrined an evolving notion of frenchness the symbolism was hard to miss  the yellow vests have been coming out to demonstrate in paris and other large french cities for 13 straight saturdays now bedeviling the government of president emmanuel macron with the vagueness of their demands and the lack of a leadership to negotiate with how it plays out could have consequences well beyond france s borders the size of the protests has been shrinking and mr macron s approval ratings have been creeping back up from a devastatingly low 23 percent in december after the demonstrators first emerged initially to protest a rise in the tax on gasoline which already costs more than 6 a gallon in france but the yellow vests show no sign of ending their weekly invasions of the capital anytime soon and polls show that a majority of the french continue to support them their protests have morphed into a popular movement an uprising of provincial towns and villages what urban french idealize as la france profonde the deep timeless france against a sense of being forgotten in their picturesque countryside with incomes that barely stretch to the end of each month though organized protests by unions students or other groups of the left or right are a fixture of french public life the yellow vests are something new and unfamiliar in their absence of an organization defined demands or ideology violent fringe groups have latched onto the weekly protests clashing with the police setting cars on fire and smashing store windows but a large majority of the yellow vests are neither violent nor radical  bourges france in a world seething with anger over the widening gap between the rich and everyone else france stands out as a country elaborately engineered to protect social

belgium and sweden spend a larger percentage of their economies on social welfare programs for working age citizens according to an analysis by the organization for economic cooperation and development even so france is consumed by a ferocious and sustained outpouring of social unrest the tumultuous intermittently violent protests of the so called yellow vest movement have shaken the country since they began in november intensifying in recent weeks president emmanuel macron had been preparing to address the nation last monday to detail new measures in response to the demonstrations but as the notre dame cathedral went up in flames that evening mr macron scrapped his address and used the devastation of a beloved and iconic monument to call for national unity  paris in paris heart a charred and gaping hole but also a rallying cry the disfigurement of notre dame the splendid cathedral that has watched over the french capital for centuries and is now a blackened wreck mourned around the globe felt to parisians like a body blow as impossible to stomach as the eternal loss to new york of its twin towers as unfathomable as the idea of egypt shorn of its pyramids or london robbed of buckingham palace which is why even before the tears had dried and firefighters had extinguished the flames the immediate visceral imperative was to rebuild here s money here s wood donations poured in from billionaires pledging hundreds of millions of euros to the more modest offerings of those who gave what they could spare a nation that for months of violent yellow vest protests has been more divided than at any time since world war ii suddenly found a shared mission in the ashes of disaster restore for future generations the gift of notre dame that previous generations handed down to us experience says the new found unity won t last it didn t even after gunmen massacred 130 people at the bataclan concert hall and other paris sites in 2015 and killed 17

s foreign minister has criticized a french decision to mark april 24 as a day of commemoration of the armenian genocide saying france should look at its own dark history mevlut cavusoglu made the comments friday during a tense exchange of words with a french parliamentarian at a nato meeting in turkey a day after french president emmanuel macron s decision was inscribed in france s official journal many historians regard the mass killings of armenians under the ottoman empire a century ago the first genocide of the 20th century turkey rejects the term genocide contending that those who died were victims of civil war cavusoglu said france is the last country to teach turkey a lesson on genocide and history we haven t forgotten what happened in rwanda and algeria  london iran protested to france on sunday over comments by the french ambassador in washington concerning tehran s right to enrich uranium after 2025 tehran agreed under a 2015 deal with world powers to restrict its nuclear program in return for the lifting of sanctions that had crippled its economy some of these limits are due to be removed after 10 years and some others after 15 years however u s president donald trump withdrew from the deal last year saying one of the defects in the accord is that limits on the iranian nuclear program start to expire on saturday france s ambassador to the united states gérard araud said on twitter it s false to say that at the expiration of the jcpoa the nuclear deal iran will be allowed to enrich uranium adding that sanctions could be reimposed  macron received some support for his lofty five year restoration goal from his presidential cultural heritage envoy stephane bern who said it was realistic to reopen notre dame to the public in time for the olympic games in paris in 2024 however he did not indicate whether the reconstruction work would be completed by then speaking after a meeting at the presidential palace about the monument s reconstruction bern said macron didn t express his views regarding the rebuilding of the cathedral s lead roof or whether the frame should be restored in wood like the destroyed one or in metal or concrete he also said france would hold an international architecture competition to determine whether the collapsed 19th century spire would be rebuilt to the same design or a new one meanwhile notre dame s rector said he would close the cathedral for up to five to six years acknowledging that a segment of the structure may be gravely weakened according to a french government official the building would have burned to the ground in a chain reaction collapse had firefighters not moved as rapidly as they did to battle the blaze racing through the building the firefighters acted aggressively to protect wooden supports in the twin medieval bell towers from the flames averting a bigger catastrophe said josé vaz de matos a fire expert with france s culture ministry if the fire reached this wooden structure the bell tower would have been lost de matos said at a news conference from the moment we lose the war of the bell towers we lose the cathedral because it s a chain reaction collapse an initial fire alert was sounded at 6 20 p m as a mass was underway in the cathedral but no fire was found a second alarm went off at 6 43 p m and the blaze was discovered on the roof no one was killed in the fire after firefighters and church officials speedily evacuated those inside  strasbourg france monuments are the emotional backbone of france that accounts for the despair over a blaze that killed no one yet seared the collective soul it is the power notre dame had and still has despite the charred scars on its gothic walls it is not only the unique beauty of the eiffel tower in paris the palaces of versailles or mont saint michel proudly facing the sea that make monuments the epitome of france it is also the sense of nationhood they represent across the nation the pain was equally felt especially because just about every region has a similar treasure to cherish for all it was clear the monument transcended its religious meaning and instead was a symbol of european civilization

wineries in bordeaux and china is the top export market for bordeaux wine the chinese push into that culturally symbolic sector has created some backlash but not enough to stop french owners from selling their properties with mr xi silently listening monday mr macron said that europe had never considered individual rights as culturally specific and that its preoccupation remained for the respect of fundamental and individual rights he said that the two had had frank exchanges on the subject but french analysts of relations with china said monday that commercial relations were the real subject of preoccupation it s the question of reciprocity said jean philippe béja of sciences po the research university we ve been open towards trade and investment and the chinese have never let us enter their state procurements process europeans he suggested had also become more aware and wary of technology transfers and investments that help the chinese government develop its potential and in the case of artificial intelligence it s about control and exporting control said mr béja referring to advances in chinese government surveillance of its own citizenry we re more fearful than the other members of the european union about chinese power and hegemony said françois godement an expert at the institut montaigne research center in paris china is pushing its own pawns he said particularly in parts of africa where for decades french dominance has been undisputed mr macron insisted monday that france and china were not strategic rivals in africa though he said the two nations could be much more important partners appearing to reflect a worry about chinese investment on the continent  tehran iran iran s semi official isna news agency reports the foreign ministry has

araud s remarks unacceptable and in open violation of the nuclear deal  brussels a departure of britain from the eu without a deal might be preferable than obstruction of eu operations by the british

for defensive purposes on the border  the filtered import of foreign imams may look like a good practical solution in fact it s an ideological trap these imams even if acting in good faith can only reinforce communalism in france and work against integration because they are not french in the name of laïcité france is dangerously delegating its islam to other states those states benefit for the algerian government the export of imams seems to confirm the country s return to stability saudi arabia sees proselytizing as a form of soft power so does turkey which appears invested in maintaining a religious lobby abroad the stakes are high apparently when last year the austrian government expelled about 60 turkish preachers to counter it said the creation of parallel societies and political islam turkey called the move racist and islamophobic when the french government said it wanted to create a distinct islam of france algeria speaking indirectly via an expert s op ed in state media accused it of arrogance tinted with ignorance the import of imams the foreign financing of mosques these delegations of power by the french authorities are a dead end they won t do enough to stem radicalism in france and they will do even less to nurture the emergence of precisely an islam of france the president s office seems to want to overcome all this but some of the participants in that first meeting convened by mr macron at the beginning of the year reacted with calculated anger before accepting the invitation members of the french council of the muslim faith decried the colonial administration of islam it s a clever conflation by invoking colonialism they can leverage guilt as a bargaining chip while maintaining islam s communal valence why do that for fear of losing power if france develops a sui generis form of islam harping on muslims status as a once colonized group is a way of highlighting their ties to their countries of origin over those to their host country past attempts to create muslim councils the great mosque of paris the federation of french muslims the union of islamic organizations in france also known as muslims of france that could effectively represent france s various muslim communities have failed one reason is the rivalry among the groups leaders different confessional strands and foreign governments with ties to immigrant communities algeria competes with morocco and both of them compete with turkey and saudi arabia as the journalist henri tincq has pointed out on slate fr the paris mosque is loyal to algeria the federation of
