i also get the resentment of brits at having regulations set by faceless e u bureaucrats in brussels and i get their resentment at the globalized urban elites who those in the rural areas here believed looked down at them and i get the squeeze on middle class wages here that gets blamed unfairly on the e u and immigrants the way president trump blames mexicans i get all of that but i also get what it means to be a leader in the 21st century and it sure doesn t mean asserting your sovereignty over all other considerations or breaking out of the giant e u market where the u k sends over 40 percent of its exports without a serious national discussion of the costs and benefits what do the most effective leaders today have in common they wake up every morning and ask themselves the same questions what world am i living in what are the biggest trends in this world and how do i educate my citizens about this world and align my policies so more of my people can get the best out of these trends and cushion the worst so what world are we living in for starters we re living in a world that is becoming so interconnected thanks to digitization the internet broadband mobile devices the cloud and soon to be 5g wireless transmissions that we are becoming interdependent to an unprecedented degree in this world growth increasingly depends on the ability of yourself your community your town your factory your school and your country to be connected to more and more of the flows of knowledge and investment and not just rely on stocks of stuff over centuries notes john hagel who currently co heads deloitte s center for the edge business has been organized around stocks of knowledge as the basis for value creation the key to creating economic value has been to acquire some proprietary knowledge stocks aggressively protect those knowledge stocks and then efficiently extract the economic value from those knowledge stocks and deliver them to the market the challenge in a more rapidly changing world is that knowledge stocks depreciate at an accelerating rate in this kind of world the key source of economic value shifts from stocks to flows the companies that will create the most economic value in the future hagel says will be the ones that find ways to participate more effectively in a broader range of more diverse knowledge flows that can refresh knowledge stocks at an accelerating rate  if the talks do not lead to a single unified approach soon the government would instead look to establish a consensus on a small number of clear options on the future relationship that could be put to the house in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue the government stands ready to abide by the decision of the house if the opposition will commit to doing the same these steps demonstrate that the government is determined to bring this process to a resolution quickly the government acknowledges however that after approval to the withdrawal agreement is achieved the process of enacting those commitments in domestic law and therefore ratifying the agreement in the united kingdom will take time therefore having reluctantly sought an extension to the article 50 period last month the government must now do so again it remains the government s view that despite this request to extend the article 50 period it is in the interests of neither the united kingdom as a departing member state nor the european union as a whole that the united kingdom holds elections to the european parliament however the united kingdom accepts the european council s view that if the united kingdom were still a member state of the european union on 23 may 2019 it would be under a legal obligation to hold the elections the government is therefore undertaking the lawful and responsible preparations for this contingency including by making the order that sets the date of the poll the process i have laid out in paragraphs 4 and 5 is designed to bring the house of commons to rapid approval of the withdrawal agreement and a shared vision for the future relationship and to allow the government to introduce the withdrawal agreement bill and so ratify the agreement an important part of that process will be the government agreeing with the opposition a program for the bill the government s objective is to ensure that this program means the bill can complete its passage such that the agreement can be brought into force and the united kingdom withdraw from the european union in time to cancel the european parliament elections i am writing therefore to inform the european council that the united kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under article 50 3 of the treaty on european union including as applied by article 106a of the euratom treaty  brussels following is the text of an eu summit agreement on thursday giving britain more time to complete its withdrawal from the european union 1 the european council takes note of the letter of prime minister theresa may of 5 april 2019 asking for a further extension of the period referred to in article 50 3 teu 2 in response the european council agrees to an extension to allow for the ratification of the withdrawal agreement such an extension should last only as long as necessary and in any event no longer than 31 october 2019 if the withdrawal agreement is ratified by both parties before this date the withdrawal will take place on the first day of the following month 3 the european council underlines that the extension cannot be allowed to undermine the regular functioning of the union and its institutions if the uk is still a member of the eu on 23 26 may 2019 and if it has not ratified the withdrawal agreement by 22 may 2019 it must hold the elections to the european parliament in accordance with union law if the united kingdom fails to live up to this obligation the withdrawal will take place on 1 june 2019  beirut lebanon an

most detailed evidence to date that the crown prince considered killing mr khashoggi long before a team of saudi operatives strangled him inside the saudi consulate in istanbul and dismembered his body using a bone saw mr khashoggi s murder prompted weeks of outrage around the world and among both parties in washington where senior lawmakers called for an investigation into who was responsible

the european union or brexit as the possibility grows of britain s crashing out with no deal so too does the likelihood of the reimposition of a hard border with the irish republic that many people see as a dire threat to peace and stability but mr donnelly has a different take while he shares a sense of alarm about a hard border he also thinks talk of its return has brought much needed clarity

allowed the women to be released because they were under international pressure and that the charges would eventually be dropped but we can t trust that so the pressure must continue to make sure they re completely free he said the women s arrests preceded the much publicized lifting of a ban on driving by women in saudi arabia just one of many restrictions opposed by the activists they were also advocates for the rights of domestic violence victims and urged the kingdom s leaders to dismantle saudi arabia s guardianship system which requires women to obtain permission from a male guardian

in yemen in an effort to recover some of the items yemeni officials visited washington and new york in recent days to ask the trump administration and the united nations to help them forestall the scattering of a heritage that stretches back nearly 4 000 years their central request is that the united states issue an emergency order that would bar the import of yemeni artifacts that did not carry special documentation typically antiquities from abroad cannot enter the country without documentation mandated in one on one agreements between the nation of origin and the united states because yemen is not party to any such agreement its artifacts simply need to be declared at customs in a routine way the saudi backed yemeni government hopes the united states will impose new rules requiring importers to show proof that the objects had been legally obtained that proof could be in the form of a government authorization or documents proving that the items had a well established

wednesday of entering a conflict with iran without first seeking explicit congressional approval telling senators there is no doubt there is a connection between al qaeda and iran his comments came

country senator rand paul republican of kentucky pushed mr pompeo to commit that the trump administration would not attack iran under a war authorization allowing the use of military force against al qaeda and other extremist groups responsible for the terrorist attacks of sept 11 2001 mr pompeo demurred saying he would prefer to just leave that to lawyers mr paul a libertarian who promotes

hearing of the senate foreign relations committee  washington secretary of state mike pompeo declared on wednesday that china is in a league of its own when it comes to human rights violations and one of his top officials compared beijing s roundup of muslim minorities to movements into camps not seen since the 1930s the official michael kozak who heads the state department s human rights bureau did not explicitly mention nazi germany or the creation of concentration camps but that was clearly the comparison he was making taken together the statements amounted to the most direct condemnation the united states has made to the roundup of millions of uighurs and other minorities the charge is bound to inflame the government in beijing at a moment of high tension in trade talks and the standoff over huawei the chinese communications giant seeking to operate in many western markets the detention camps in china s western xinjiang region have expanded since 2017 to include an estimated one million uighurs kazakhs and other muslims in a program that tries to turn them into loyal supporters of the chinese government the camps have been broadly condemned including by the united nations

resolution they said it wouldn t happen congress doesn t ever invoke the war powers act it was a really long arduous process of education in its justification for opposing the resolution the white house argued that the use of the act is flawed because the pentagon has provided limited support to member countries of the saudi led coalition in yemen that argument may have been more resonant years ago repeated bipartisan attempts in 2016 to rebuke the american role in the saudi led intervention stalled in both the house and the senate beginning with efforts to block the sale of munitions to the

ringside seat at many of the most significant world events of the second half of the 20th century she is the same age as queen elizabeth ii and like that remarkable monarch she still seems in her early 90s to be completely engaged with the world understanding of its foibles and appreciative of what life has to offer she has witnessed extraordinary changes that it has been her job to report she went to nepal with edmund hillary to cover the first successful ascent of mount everest in 1953 then a feat of immense difficulty and now a climb that can be done by any amateurs who can afford the fee following permanently fixed ropes as one might use a banister to climb the stairs morris has seen empires fade she has witnessed the advances and retreats of armies she covered the trial of adolf eichmann she courageously carried through her own change of gender from james to jan in 1972 when such things were very much more of a challenge so it s not surprising that in my mind s eye her highly engaging collection of daily diary entries should have change as the leitmotif that runs throughout image it would be surprising if there weren t a tinge of regret in such an enterprise from the pen of a nonagenarian no matter how willing you may be to adjust to new conditions when you re looking back from that end of life you must have a fair amount to feel nostalgic about in this collection then among the 188 entries there s considerable reflection on things that have gone from our world and gone the author rightly observes rather quickly and dramatically reading these beautifully written pages one is struck by the gentle note of lament they host for two countries or civilizations perhaps whose fate morris has observed at close quarters these are the united states the colossus

powerless to determine its own trade destiny the prime minister could ignore the pro brexit factions in her party and cut a deal with the labour party for a soft brexit that would at minimum leave britain in the customs union but that would risk alienating those who voted in the referendum to leave and it would risk tearing the conservatives apart an outcome that many believe is mrs may s greatest fear european officials have suggested that britain could largely avoid the single market standards by having only northern ireland abide by those listed in the backstop while a different set of rules could be adopted for the rest of the country british lawmakers have rejected that out of hand because they say that it would create a virtual border in the irish sea cutting off northern ireland from the rest of the united kingdom and moving it closer to unification with the republic of ireland mrs may argues that the backstop might never go into effect and that even if it did it would not be in place for long her government envisions a future system that would allow customs and standards checks without actually stopping and inspecting trucks or people at the irish border

announced on monday that 16 saudis including one of the closest aides to crown prince mohammed bin salman were being barred from entry to the united states the list included the close aide saud al qahtani who officially served as the royal court s media czar but appeared to have overseen the operation to seize mr khashoggi it was one of a dozen or so operations by what american intelligence officials called the saudi rapid intervention group set up by mr al qahtani to silence or eliminate dissent about prince mohammed s rapid rise to become the de facto saudi leader but conspicuously missing from the list is prince mohammed himself despite the conclusion by american intelligence agencies that he was ultimately responsible for sending the team to istanbul to kill mr khashoggi and for other actions by the rapid intervention group more than a year before mr khashoggi s death american intelligence officials intercepted a communication from the crown prince saying that if mr khashoggi a washington post journalist who lived in virginia did not voluntarily return to the kingdom and cease publishing his criticism the state should go after him with a bullet based on the findings of the c i a which he led until last year mr pompeo would have been free to add the crown prince to the list though that would have been an unusual move to take against a leader of a close

figure out the best way to respond mcconnell said at a roundtable meeting with reporters obviously what clearly happened is outrageous and unacceptable on the other hand saudi arabia s an important

it is difficult to have a decision said sebastien raspiller head of the financial sector department at france s finance ministry  london an end to austerity in britain does not mean all government departments will see their budgets keep pace with inflation conservative finance minister philip hammond said on friday last year hammond announced that years of self enforced thrift over government spending was coming to an end a claim parliament s treasury committee criticised as imprecise and lacking in detail on friday he spelled out more about what an end to austerity would mean for a multi year review of government spending due towards the end of the year alongside his annual budget all spending reviews are about prioritisation and efficiency and it would be odd to define ending austerity as meaning that every department sees an annual real terms increase in its budget hammond said in a letter to the chair of the treasury committee nicky morgan  istanbul the producer counts

sent me a bbc scotland video of jay lafferty a scottish comedian summing up the brexit situation almost three years after britain voted to leave the european union so the way i understand it is that parliament have said no to theresa s deal she says referring to prime minister theresa may of britain and they ve said no to no deal but some of them said yes to no deal but no to theresa s deal but not as many that said no to no deal and no to theresa s deal but they don t actually have a deal of their own which is a big deal because without a deal then no deal is more likely to be the deal that s dealt and the people who want the deal can t be dealing with that or as tom baldwin the director of communications for the people s vote campaign for a second referendum put it to me the problem with brexit is not theresa may the problem with brexit is brexit here we are brexit is not doable because it makes no sense whatever the prime minister s scattershot efforts or offers to resign you can hoodwink people but not if you give them three years to reflect on how they were hoodwinked before doing the deed the hoodwinking was about the british cannot actually go through with something that will lower their incomes make them poorer lose them jobs drain investment expose their market to trade deals over which they would have no say and just an afterthought lead to the breakup of britain  london a small but influential party aligned with prime minister theresa may s government suggested on friday that it still cannot support her plan for britain s departure from the european union a development that could doom her hopes of persuading parliament to pass the deal next week on the third try the democratic unionist party of northern ireland holds just 10 seats in the 650 seat house of commons but the central sticking point in the talks on a british withdrawal has been how to handle the border between northern ireland and ireland and the party s position carries disproportionate weight with others in parliament parliament has twice rejected the agreement that mrs may negotiated with the european union for britain s departure known as brexit and both times the d u p has voted against it largely because of concerns about the border issue if parliament rejects the deal again there is still the possibility of a cliff edge brexit in the short term or a much longer delay to renegotiate the agreement to leave  a turkish television network broadcast video on monday showing men with suitcases supposedly containing the remains of jamal khashoggi the dissident writer killed by saudi agents in october after weeks of shifting stories about mr khashoggi s disappearance saudi arabia said that its agents had killed him in the saudi consulate in istanbul during a botched mission to take him back to the kingdom the saudi account of the killing has continued to change since then without providing clues about an enduring mystery of the murder what happened to mr khashoggi s remains turkish officials have said that saudi agents disassembled mr khashoggi s body with a bone saw and probably carried the remains out of the consulate in suitcases  london police officers and counterterrorism officials in britain were investigating attacks on five mosques thursday including one in which a man took a sledgehammer to smash the windows of a house of worship in

proved fairly resilient several of the criminals who helped trump get elected either have gone to prison or soon will democrats won control of the house in 2018 and have already started checking the president s power the courts have blocked some of trump s more egregious nativist policies including his effort to rescind deferred action for childhood arrivals or daca trump s attempts at racist demagogy often end up mobilizing public opinion against him there s been a revival of civic activism according to freedom house the united states score for freedom of assembly has actually improved in the last year listen to the argument podcast every thursday morning with ross douthat michelle goldberg and david leonhardt but the freedom house report gives us at least two reasons for continuing alarm the first is that it usually takes more than two years for a democracy to collapse elsewhere in the world in places like hungary venezuela or turkey freedom house has watched as democratic institutions gradually succumbed to sustained pressure from an antidemocratic leadership often after a halting start the report said abramowitz told me that an increase in corruption and a decrease in transparency both hallmarks of this administration are often early warning indicators of problems in a democracy undermining public faith in the legitimacy of the system second if americans increasingly ignore trump s words foreign leaders don t authoritarianism is on the rise all over the globe according to the freedom house report this is the 13th consecutive year that global freedom has declined trump s presidency is a consequence of this trend but it s also become an accelerant of it there are plenty of reasons to be cynical about the idea once a consensus view in american foreign policy that it s the sacred duty of the united states to promote democracy around the world one of the pretexts for america s war in iraq after all was that it would spread democracy in the middle east under trump however we re learning that an american approach to the world that is completely amoral and transactional creates its own dangers  london britain s tottering efforts to leave the european union remained at an impasse on thursday as allies of prime minister theresa may tried to keep her deal alive in the face of unbending opposition the deal already defeated twice in parliament was given new life on wednesday after mrs may promised conservative party colleagues who are hard line supporters of leaving the bloc that she would step down if it were passed and let someone else take over the next stage of talks with brussels for the process known as brexit who could be britain s next prime minister here are some contenders but even her offer to resign was not enough to assuage hard line conservatives or her putative allies in the democratic unionist party of northern ireland or d u p who hate the deal so the government tried a new tack on thursday

effort to try to get parliament to pass her plan for britain to leave the european union prime minister theresa may on wednesday offered to step down and allow another prime minister who has the confidence of her party and lawmakers to negotiate the final details mrs may s stunning overture to her fellow conservatives came just as parliament tried to sideline her and come up with its own plan for brexit as the process of leaving the bloc is known but when lawmakers held a series of nonbinding votes on wednesday night on eight different options for britain s future relationship with the european union none mustered a majority mrs may is so unpopular and has lost so much authority within her party that her offer to step down if her plan is approved was greeted with relief by tory

by women and allowing them into sports stadiums last month he named a princess reema bint bandar bin sultan as the new saudi ambassador to washington when asked on 60 minutes last year whether men and women were equal prince mohammed said absolutely we are all human beings and there is no difference asked about guardianship in another interview he said he wanted to figure out a way to treat this that doesn t harm families and doesn t harm the culture but rights advocates say guardianship makes women and men profoundly unequal and leaves a woman with little recourse if she ends up with a controlling or abusive guardian they are trying to put an image out there that they are giving more rights to women but if they really want to do that they need to get rid of guardianship ms carroll said ms vierra moved to saudi arabia in 2011 to teach at a women s university while doing research for a graduate degree ms carroll said friends introduced her to a saudi businessman who had been educated abroad and seemed supportive of her ambitions they married in 2013 inviting friends to a destination wedding in portugal at the beginning it seemed really great said ms carroll who was the maid of honor he was charming and loving and generous and kind she felt like she had met somebody who was on the same page as her the marriage produced the daughter zaina but eventually grew rocky ms vierra s husband often lost his temper shouting and swearing at her in front of zaina ms carroll said ms vierra asked for a divorce which men in saudi arabia but not women can grant by merely speaking a few words for more than a year he took no action on her request  the government s repayment policy is an extension of its approach to british tourists or other citizens who get in trouble abroad and need help returning to the united kingdom people 18 years or older have to reimburse the government that age limit came into effect after the guardian newspaper reported two years ago on a 17 year old british teenager who sought help at the british embassy in islamabad to escape a forced marriage in 2014 she had to sign a loan agreement and hand in her british passport before being allowed to return to the united kingdom and ultimately was billed more than 1 000 with her passport being held until she paid after that 16 and 17 year olds became exempt from the reimbursement policy the times of london reported on four british women who were each charged roughly 900 for the government s efforts to free them from a religious institution in somalia where they said they had been chained whipped and told they would be held until they married the women s families sent them there because they thought the women were too independent ayaan 24 who had been at the institution for two years said she signed a loan agreement on the day she was rescued i was left to fend for myself she told the times of london the loan has caused so much anxiety just as the government would not charge a crime victim for investigating a crime it should not charge women for bringing them back home said alison gardner an assistant professor of sociology who studies modern slavery at the university of nottingham she said a 1 000 debt could be devastating for a young woman whose family has tried to force her to marry and could disown her if she escaped it s an example of this general policy of

is northeast of there in the fertile punakha valley one is in a central glacial valley where black necked cranes make their home in winter another is in the district of bumthang known for its weavers and the last is in mountainous paro the idea was to show all that bhutan has to offer and wangchuk says to create something that was environmentally conscious and without any snobbishness and garishness the bumthang lodge buildings are made of locally sourced timber and stone and filled with understated wooden furniture and hand loomed covers for bedding and pillows even the more luxurious touches are of a piece with their environment at the paro villas individual infinity pools seem to flow down into stepped rice paddies each lodge also has a restaurant serving bhutanese classics like

the saudi demand seemingly out of a desire not to be shut out of a new market netflix has defended its position by stating we strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and only removed this episode in saudi arabia after we had received a valid legal request and to comply with local law but sometimes one has to choose artistic freedom over complying with a repressive and arbitrary law netflix

east dany at dragonstone enemies to the south ellaria sand and the dornish rebels enemies to the west olenna tyrell and the reach enemies to the north the starks and the northern lords isolated and in debt cersei realizes she needs more allies so she enlists euron greyjoy and his fleet she also wages a pr war hammering home the argument that dany is like her father the mad king who had to be deposed and that she s a foreign invader leading an army of savages she tells the people that the dothraki will burn their villages to the ground never mind that cersei herself burned the sept to the ground she doesn t need to create fake news dany s past behavior is enough to make cersei sound like the better option but even with the new allies she s able to recruit the greyjoy fleet the tarlys of the reach cersei still doesn t have the numbers what her side does have though is the element of surprise euron greyjoy ambushes the rebel greyjoy fleet sailing from dragonstone to sunspear perhaps if dany s war council had looked at a map before setting sail from meereen they might have decided to land in sunspear first which is on the way to the more predictable destination of dragonstone if dany had been willing to skip the symbolic move of landing at the place where she was born she might still have a fleet the lannisters next surprise involves emptying casterly rock and relocating the majority of their forces to highgarden casterly rock with its empty goldmines hasn t counted for much in ages except to tyrion who sees it as his inheritance and is using dany to take it did he not learn during his stint as master of coin that it was mined out so it s the perfect bait for tyrion who decides to split dany s forces to stage two operations on opposite sides of westeros both of them near hostile waters why does he not see this on the map why does no one suggest they use the dragons for aerial reconnaissance tyrion s plan is built on avoiding the perception that dany is a foreign invader when they should be embracing it wearing it like armor they could fuse ground air and naval forces and demonstrate a united coalition when dany takes matters into her own hands and rethinks these tactics she finally wins a battle dany s m o in slaver s bay was to play the liberator extreme violence she could argue was warranted against tyrannical oppressors and what is cersei if not a tyrant but dany s speech to the survivors of the loot train attack makes her sound like another tyrant bend the knee and join me refuse and die how is that breaking the wheel no wonder randyll and dickon tarly opt out as tyrion keeps trying to point out it would be better to offer more possibilities imprisonment the night s watch even exile give people of westeros a real choice killing the tarlys only reinforces dany s dreadful rep dany s biggest mistakes then include failing to seek a swift and decisive victory failing to neutralize a weaker enemy failing to listen to yara who has the most military experience failing to engage in the necessary battle of public relations failing to give other houses a reason to rally behind her and failing to think beyond limited binary constructs she thinks she can be either a villain or a hero queen of the ashes or hope for a better world use dragons to burn down cities or not use them at all she never considers other ways to press her advantage she could fly directly to the red keep and target cersei and only cersei with a surgical strike do a few flyovers to impress or intimidate but not incinerate the rest of the nobility use the dothraki to prevent the lannister army from leaving king s landing at all or consider economic and diplomatic strategies the way cersei does dany s next mistake underestimating both the night king and cersei is to agree to the wight hunt and then risk all three dragons for a rescue operation for which she had limited intel she should have focused on taking cersei out of the equation instead dany falls for yet another trap and hands over a powerful weapon to an enemy who has more creative ways to use a dragon for decades sports gambling tended to be a static experience you bet on a team and handed money to somebody and maybe got a slip of paper in return then you waited to find out if you were right that changed when three american options traders moved to antigua in the mid 1990s to create an online gambling business they named world sports exchange instead of offering point spreads world sports exchange operated like a commodities market before tipoff options on the favored lakers for example might cost 60 each options on the knicks the underdogs might sell for 40 at the end of the game the options on the losing team would become worthless while the options on the winning team would each pay out 100 but here was the novelty you didn t have to wait until the game was over to cash in if the lakers scored the first eight points the value of that 60 option might grow to say 72 you could sell it and pocket your 12 gain you might then invest in the knicks at a discount or you might wait for the price to fall and buy another option on the lakers you could buy and sell options on either team or both throughout the game once you d started it was hard to stop until the game ended it was exhausting it was also great fun and even more than the other bookmakers operating beyond u s borders which were handling traditional bets it seemed to threaten the monopoly on sports gambling that nevada s casinos had long enjoyed i met one of those traders haden ware under a thatched roof in the caribbean in early 2000 he was drinking beer and eating lobster salad steve schillinger a partner at world sports exchange later confided to me that he and ware were each making more than 1 million a year yet they were miserable the interstate wire act of 1961 had outlawed taking bets over telephone lines in that era of dial up internet access that s exactly what world sports exchange was doing online gambling was especially pernicious in the words of jon kyl the u s senator from arizona you get up in the morning and log on to your computer and start to gamble it plays to the addictive nature of many people especially kids quoting an unnamed harvard professor kyl called it the crack cocaine of gambling a conservative republican kyl introduced specific legislation against internet gambling and vowed to indict expats taking bets online in 1998 21 u s citizens were charged with wire act violations among them were ware schillinger and jay cohen another partner weary of living in exile cohen flew home he was convicted and served 18 months in prison janet reno the u s attorney general backed kyl s efforts so did casinos sports leagues and gambling interest groups just about everyone in fact except some indian tribes even the lobbyist being paid by world sports exchange acknowledged that the opponents of digital gambling had a point the casinos worked a long time to establish legitimacy he told me eventually world sports exchange was overtaken by better funded rivals it ceased operations in 2013 that same day schillinger committed suicide after serving his sentence cohen disappeared to europe by then though their insight that betting doesn t have to stop when play begins had revolutionized the industry what draftkings and its competitors are currently doing in new jersey and what companies like betfair and bet365 do in england could not exist without it since the demise of world sports exchange sports betting on various hand held devices has proliferated and because smartphones and tablets routinely capture the details of each transaction proponents argue that games are actually better protected against manipulation when digital betting is legal if there was a huge bet placed against a team two hours before an announcement that its star player wouldn t be participating that is something that should cause us to investigate silver says and it s something that historically we wouldn t have known for many n b a owners and some in other leagues as well the conversion began in 2014 with silver s op ed and his argument that legalization actually offered more protection not less from the unsavory characters who might try to influence players europe was proving to be a test case and its teams were thriving now leonsis has come along telling owners that their franchises would gain in value because gambling like fantasy leagues gives fans another reason to be engrossed in a sport ted was able to articulate the value proposition of not just the betting but the deepening of the engagement guber says rather than customers leonsis thinks of fans as an audience he understood that audiences want experiences guber says this gives them a chance to walk away telling their own story i saw this opportunity i recognized what this player would be able to accomplish when you have a tool that makes an audience more of a participant than a passenger it s a very vital and vibrant element  writing with the assurance and wry omniscience of an easygoing deity makumbi watches her protagonists live out invariably provisional answers they are pagans and christians vagabonds and military generals newspaper columnists and victims of h i v some are looking for families like the orphan girl vying for her neighbors charity in a crowded kampala boardinghouse others are in flight from relatives like the elderly christian missionary nostalgic for british rule named kanani or canaan he believes that faith will save him from the family curse and spends his days proselytizing at captive commuters the church was like a bus and brethren were passengers on their way to heaven rather than a family none quite manage to escape or fulfill their appointed roles when kintu s carnival of clans royal courts kampala apartments and church groups concludes it is hardly clearer what form family might take or how individuals should reconcile themselves to kinship there is nevertheless a beauty to how makumbi s characters improvise alternatives to what they do not have or cannot be in one characteristically tender and comic moment a young man without a father looks for a surrogate to negotiate with a school s headmaster over a scholarship his roommate obliges and finds himself so caught up in the charade that he sheds prideful tears at his son s test results dressed for the meeting in a pinstripe suit that makes him resemble a broke black gangster from an american film he boasts and blusters with a parent s loving obstinacy it may be a curse that families never work but it is surely a blessing that they can always be reinvented if makumbi s kintus are cursed like cain the heroes of wayétu moore s she would be king graywolf press 26 are cursed like storm wolverine and professor x the liberian american writer s debut novel is a marvelesque national epic about liberia s independence centered on three supernaturally gifted misfits the leader is gbessa an immortal girl expelled as a witch by her indigenous vai people who finds shelter among the black american settlers of monrovia the american colonization society an antebellum organization dedicated to resettling african americans in west africa established liberia in 1821 the country declared independence in 1847 gbessa joins forces with two other renegades a magically invincible plantation runaway from virginia and a jamaican maroon with the ability to disappear these newcomers patrol the coast like abolitionist avengers

immortality for africa s antiquity invisibility for maroon cunning invincibility for the endurance of enslaved african americans allegorize the diasporic strands united by the country s history who needs wakanda when liberia already has it all the varied and frenetic action makes for a novel that while stimulating is often confusing and overstuffed some sections read like folk tales or adventure novels while those set in virginia serve up reheated plantation melodrama she would be king shows greater originality when moore dissects monrovia s social world patronized by americo liberian ladies who see themselves less as fellow africans than as a civilizing vanguard gbessa negotiates a double exclusion that only intensifies once she marries the settlers military chief a conflict between the new arrivals and her estranged kin forces her into the role of mediator brokering a hybrid identity for africa s first republic few novelists have explored the singular relationship between liberia s black settlers for whom returning to africa was a form of deliverance from american white supremacy and the indigenous people who fell under their dominion moore s sophisticated treatment of this encounter showcases her novelistic talents though the tension somewhat dissipates when the real enemies arrive the complex dance of nation building gives way to a garveyite battle royale pitting the reconciled settlers and natives against french slavers who attack monrovia  washington president trump s legislative path to a border wall has narrowed significantly on the eve of tuesday s state of the union speech and his fallback plan to circumvent congress by declaring a state of emergency could create a major division in his own party as he prepares to make his case to the largest national audience of the year mr trump appeared to be in an increasingly precarious position unable to sway the wider public to his cause and unwilling at least so far to apply the persuasion and compromise that have gotten previous presidents out of political jams anxiety over the damage being inflicted on the party is growing last week in a one on one meeting with the president senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky the majority leader reportedly warned mr trump that declaring a national emergency to build his wall would almost certainly spark a rebellion within his party and a vote to overrule him house and senate negotiators have been moving toward a bipartisan agreement as early as friday to keep the government funded after feb 15 with or without the president s support but the president s supporters continue to plead for unity this is the defining moment of his presidency said senator lindsey graham a south carolina republican who is one of mr trump s biggest supporters on capitol hill speaking at an event in greenville on monday  jerusalem i want to tell you about a piece of clay the size of my pinkie fingernail and the color of ash it is called a bulla and it is what the people of the ancient near east used before the invention of rubber bands or paper clips they would roll up their papyrus wrap cords around the bundle and secure it all with a bit of clay the clay would then be stamped with a seal the primitive version of a john hancock this particular bulla was dug out of the ground in october by an archaeologist named yuval gadot in the many years he s been spading the earth in this city dr gadot a professor at tel aviv university has found several bullas this one is special this bulla connects to a whole context a whole world that we have been uncovering in this spot dr gadot explained the spot he s talking about is the city of david the mound of ancient jerusalem which archaeologists have been trying to uncover for 150 years when most people think of jerusalem they think of the walled old city the place that contains the western wall and the aqsa mosque and the via dolorosa and inspires more religious fervor than perhaps anywhere else on earth but the jerusalem of the bible is a modest narrow ridge just outside the walls yuval baruch the jerusalem regional archaeologist of the israel antiquities authority described it this way jerusalem was the capital of judean kings and that capital was located in what we call today the city of david archaeologists have been engaged in a ferocious debate about whether a king named david literally built his palace here dr gadot who belongs to the school of archaeology known as biblical minimalism is skeptical but almost all agree on the big picture which is that the 11 acre mound is the seat of the davidic dynasty which begot what we now call jewish civilization yuval gadot at the edge of the givati parking lot dig where he found the bulla mauricio lima for the new york times you cannot cast doubts over the importance of this place this is the acropolis of israel dr gadot said there is just one problem the acropolis of israel is being unearthed in east jerusalem which much of the world does not regard as belonging to the state of israel and it is being unearthed at least in part beneath the homes of palestinians from land that those palestinians want to be incorporated into their future state if any archaeological dig in this part of the world is bound to hit on ethnic national and religious fault lines this one is the middle eastern equivalent of the san andreas because in jerusalem the contest over the city s past is part of the war over its future workers on the afternoon shift digging underneath houses near the shiloach pool in the silwan neighborhood mauricio lima for the new york times the archaeologists hard at work uncovering ancient jerusalem are not consumed with borders and politics they aren t looking up they are looking down at olive pits and shards of clay and thinking about what they tell us about the past they say this latest find this bulla the discovery of which has not been previously reported is from the middle of the seventh or beginning of the sixth century b c judging by the style of writing on it and the pottery found next to it this was the period when the first temple stood in jerusalem the heyday of the judaic monarchy it was the period when jews were not yet jews but judahites when they worshiped their god by slaughtering animals when many among them still secretly practiced magic and prayed to idols more than 500 years before the jew now known as jesus was born a name has been stamped into its surface if you read ancient hebrew the words are easily decipherable l natan melech eved hamelech or to natan melech the king s servant natan melech appears in the second book of kings as a chamberlain in king josiah s court natan melech himself is a kind of a mystery said dr gadot but what he was a part of a very developed monarchy that expressed itself through bureaucracy and writing is hugely significant we hear about the big empires in mesopotamia but for the creation of our civilization this is the cradle david be eri on the underground pilgrim s road mauricio lima for the new york times queen victoria dispatched charles warren to dig here in 1867 and archaeologists have been digging ever since starting in the 1960s excavations became more systematic and a clear vision of the city in its different historical periods began to emerge among the bonanza of finds bullas with the names of two characters from the book of jeremiah a large stone building from the 10th century b c that some have theorized was king david s palace a pool from the first century a d that many believe is the pool of siloam mentioned in the gospel of john as the place where jesus healed the blind man eggplant seeds from the early islamic period coins cooking vessels and an engraving of a menorah left behind in a 2 000 year old drainage channel by jewish rebels hiding from the romans an ancient roman road that may have taken hundreds of thousands of jewish pilgrims up to the second temple donations have poured in including from americans both liberals like the tech entrepreneur marc benioff and conservatives like the financier roger hertog rabbi erica gerson who has given over 1 million to the project with her husband mark said there is no other sight in israel that can as effectively and authentically bring to life the 3 000 year old connection between the jewish people and our homeland before he was assassinated prime minister yitzhak rabin declared that 1996 would be celebrated as the trimillennium of jerusalem in other words the 3 000th anniversary of king david conquering the jebusite city and establishing the capital of his kingdom when i asked david friedman the current american ambassador to israel and a religious jew what the place meant to him he said without hesitating everything jerusalem was a divided city after israel s 1948 war for independence the west was israeli the east was a jordanian ruled palestinian city then came june 1967 and the arab israeli war that tripled the size of israel and transformed its national psychology israel annexed east jerusalem and overnight jerusalem became a united ethnically divided city according to israel all of jerusalem is its capital according to international law east jerusalem is occupied territory the area is majority palestinian and that s precisely where the dig is located source bing satellite imagery economic cooperation foundation database map boundaries terrestrial jerusalem dig site and palestinian populations yet as far as the state of israel is concerned east jerusalem is the equivalent of tel aviv said daniel seidemann an israeli lawyer who founded terrestrial jerusalem which supports dividing the city as part of a future two state solution those jewish israelis for whom jerusalem means something far more than territory are determined to keep all of the city under israel sovereignty and they are willing to undertake extreme measures to make it so that is where the city of david foundation comes in ultra orthodox jews praying at the western wall and palestinians at prayer at lion s gate both in the old city of jerusalem mauricio lima for the new york times this nationalist religious organization plays three roles which many see as deeply contradictory first it established and operates the city of david national park more than 600 000 tourists visited last year to view the excavations second though the archaeological dig is carried out under the auspices of the israel antiquities authority the foundation together with the government of israel the jerusalem municipality the ministry of tourism and the prime minister s office underwrites it third and most controversially it acquires homes to help settle jewish families in arab neighborhoods in east jerusalem especially wadi hilweh where the dig is located david be eri founded the organization in 1986 and everyone who lives here knows his name some think he sees himself as a modern successor to king david himself down to the fact that his wife like the biblical king s first wife is named michal those who despise him and those who adore him agree on one thing he is a visionary who has transformed this city s landscape and perhaps its future borders when you try to figure out just how he pulled it off things get very muddy very quickly david be eri at home in the city of david mauricio lima for the new york times mr be eri who is 65 was born in israel to parents who survived auschwitz when he was a young man he served in sayeret matkal the most prestigious unit of the israeli military his commander was yoni netanyahu the prime minister s older brother in the 1980s he was asked to help command a new elite counterterrorism unit called duvdevan which would send israeli soldiers undercover as arabs to palestinian neighborhoods if you ve seen the tv series fauda you get the picture the village of silwan which includes the neighborhood known variously as the city of david and wadi hilweh was one of the main places he would patrol it was a dangerous job but he ll also tell you that those years were a gift i heard from the arabs about king solomon king david they knew the historical meaning of this place he told me one day i came to michal and i said michal this is the city of david this is our historical capital and here i cannot walk here as a jew i m going to change it i m going to leave the army and bring back tourists and visitors to this place one day we are going to live here school children visiting the city of david which has become a tourist attraction mauricio lima for the new york times more than 20 years later he does the be eris live inside the national park in a home above an ancient cistern mr be eri rarely gives interviews but he has made headlines twice in the past decade once in 2010 when he ran over two palestinian boys who were part of a group throwing stones at his car with his 12 year old son the boys survived their injuries mr be eri said he feared for his life he made news again in 2017 when israel s right wing government awarded mr be eri the israel prize the country s equivalent of the medal of honor hailed as one of the greatest builders of jerusalem during the modern era mr be eri said that when he moved to the neighborhood in 1991 he was the first jewish resident there since the 1930s today because of his organization there are around 1 000 jews living among some 5 000 palestinians jawad siyam a prominent palestinian activist who runs the wadi hilweh information center and lives just across the street from the entrance to the city of david site told me that in jerusalem mr be eri is more powerful than netanyahu himself jawad siyam a palestinian activist standing near a partially collapsed lot next to one of the entrances to the excavation site mauricio lima for the new york times the official city of david foundation story is that the acquisition of the land for the dig was all kosher the people who work for the group will show you photographs from the 1910s and 1930s in which the ridge looks sparsely populated they will tell you that the palestinians who live there now are squatters they will say that much of the land was bought in the 1920s by the philanthropist baron edmond de rothschild and that the foundation reclaimed lands that were rightly his city of david

that the way they acquired homes was completely legal that they were bought outright from east jerusalem palestinians local palestinians will tell you stories of bags with dollars handed over in the dead of night of sellers jailed or beaten as collaborators by other palestinians or that they relied on israel s absentee property law which was passed in 1950 as a way of allowing the state to acquire palestinian homes that were abandoned after 1948 a partial view of the east jerusalem village of silwan mauricio lima for the new york times they tend to talk about the project as the kind of gentrification typical of any cosmopolitan city where one wealthier group pushes out a poorer one suffice it to say that this is not how many legal experts local monitoring groups or the palestinian residents see things for starters they believe that archaeology is being used as cover for a land grab the archaeological site is the tool to delete the village that is here said yonatan mizrahi who runs the anti occupation group emek shaveh and gives his own critical tours of the site the foundation he said has degraded archaeology in jerusalem from science that can teach us about our shared past into a divisive tool which pits peoples and ethnic and religious groups against each another second they see the convergence of the government which is meant to look out for all jerusalemites and the city of david foundation which has a clear political agenda as inherently corrupt they say that the absentee property law was abused by both the government and the foundation the law which in israel s fledgling years was a necessary evil became an unmitigated evil the abuse of power was so stark in east jerusalem that the israeli supreme court recently acknowledged this and restricted its application somewhat said mr seidemann the lawyer indeed in 1992 the rabin government issued a report that exposed collusion over property transfers between the state and various nationalist organizations including the city of david foundation but even if it is all technically legal where is the justice or political wisdom in such a strategy it s hard to overstate how moving it is for jews to connect to david s jerusalem said dan shapiro an ambassador to israel under president barack obama but any project that seeks to embed jewish families in arab neighborhoods of east jerusalem in the absence of any progress toward two states and a plan to share the city has a clear political intent which is to cement permanent israeli control and that isn t good for anyone who still has hope for a resolution that view once reliably centrist now seems left wing in jerusalem politics where the city of david foundation seems to have unalloyed backing when i asked nir barkat the former mayor of jerusalem and a leading likud politician if he sees the jewish families of the city of david as settlers he called the label absurd mr siyam the activist called the former mayor a slave of david be eri from my perspective jews can live anywhere they want in the world mr barkat told me they can live in pittsburgh they can live in jerusalem they can live in paris they can buy property anywhere they want in the world and you want to tell me they can t do that in jerusalem i will defend any jew who wants to live anywhere he wants in the world including and firstly in the capital of the state of israel the difference is that when a jew buys an apartment in the 18th arrondissement her presence does nothing to hurt her neighbor s national aspirations what s more jewish and muslim neighbors in paris at least in theory have the same rights and representation a palestinian youth near the al aqsa mosque in the old city mauricio lima for the new york times this is not the case for the more than 300 000 palestinians of east jerusalem of whom a vast majority remain in legal limbo citizens of no country they are considered permanent residents of jerusalem which entitles them to the same social services and health care as other israelis but they cannot vote in national elections they can vote in municipal ones and run for city council and since they constitute almost 40 percent of the population of the city they could be a major force but 99 percent boycott the vote none of this especially the fact that the city of david foundation is also a settlement enterprise makes the archaeologists who work or have worked on the dig happy they are quick to point out their independence that their salaries are paid by their universities and that their job is not tourism but to carry out a dig to the highest possible scientific standards archaeology is always political said gabriel barkay a prominent israeli archaeologist sneezing in jerusalem is an intensive political activity you can do it into the face of an arab into the face of a christian into the face of a jew to the left or the right but mr barkay a holocaust survivor and no dove thinks that the city of david foundation has made a serious error in pushing for jewish settlement in the neighborhood archaeological sites are cultural treasures he said no one should live there but they do miryam basher a palestinian high school math teacher is one of them her house is just down the road and a world away from the entrance to the city of david though she has several heavily laden lemon trees in her front yard the walls of her home have gaping cracks the result she told me of the digging taking place beneath her feet to uncover the underground pilgrim s road which the foundation hopes to open to the public in a few years ms basher said her parents built the house in 1963 and that the cracks started appearing only three years ago she has moved a large armoire against the wall with the biggest one because she is nervous it will cave in miryam basher showing cracks in the walls of her home in the east jerusalem neighborhood of wadi hilweh mauricio lima for the new york times there was injustice before and after the dig she told me over homemade lemonade but now you feel the occupation in your house you don t feel comfortable in your home i m not sure your readers can imagine our lives why not move given the location of her home i suspect it would fetch a high price would she ever consider selling it they could give me a million dollars and even if they demolished this house i d live on the stones she replied shoshi tropper is a jewish mother of five who lives down the road from ms basher she and her husband moved to the city of david 11 years ago because she told me we wanted to live somewhere meaningful though her car has been stoned more than once she said it s a normal life and we really love it shoshi tropper a jewish mother of five moved with her husband to the city of david 11 years ago mauricio lima for the new york times from outside maybe we seem like fanatics as settlers full of hate but in our life we are liberal full of love what of her relationships with her neighbors we re a jewish community and we live inside a big arab community we re neighbors she said and we get along well she showed me a red sweater that she said a palestinian neighbor had knitted for her daughter they are talking about coexistence said mr siyam when i asked him about relationships between the jewish and palestinian residents you know what kind of coexistence the kind you have with your donkey or your dog i don t know how to argue about whether king david was here or not he continued that doesn t give them the right to kick me out of this neighborhood there is a strong case to be made that the modern should always trump the ancient even on an archaeological gold mine that the needs of people living in a particular spot in the here and now are far more important than uncovering the lives of those who once did fakhri abu diab is a 57 year old palestinian resident of silwan and an activist who once served more than a year in jail for protesting the dig his home like dozens of others in his part of the village is under threat of demolition because it was built without a permit a permit he said he spent years trying in vain to get he has nothing against king david he said if king david lived here 2 000 years ago he said then i am the grandchild of king david an idea he considered an honor but he argued that the history doesn t justify what is happening to his neighborhood today people are much more important than stones he told me but what happens when the prerequisite for agreeing to a compromise with people in the present is a renunciation of the stones that are the legacy of your people s past many of the opponents of the dig aren t just arguing that it is unjust and an abuse of the law they are saying that the archaeological discoveries have been faked and that there is no evidence of a jewish civilization here all of it is lies said iman rajabi who lives 300 feet downhill from the pool of siloam at the bottom of the dig we sat at her mother in law s house and drank tea all of it is islamic there are no jewish antiquities they dig they place stuff and they convince the world it s all lies as for the temple she insisted that there never was one for sure the jews are lying this is the pretext for taking al aqsa the mosque that was built on the spot where the ancient jewish temples once stood and is the third holiest site in islam relatives of iman rajabi at their home mauricio lima for the new york times when i asked jawad siyam s deputy at the wadi hilweh information center sahar abbasi about ancient jewish roots in jerusalem she said you should for sure focus on if if if if there is any kind of history because with israeli archaeology nothing was proved even a graduate of birzeit university the top palestinian university standing with me at the western wall the remnant of the retaining wall of the second temple told me she could not utter the word temple because it would give credence to a jewish claim it s like saying the word cancer she said it wasn t always this way a 1925 booklet put out by the waqf the jordanian authority that oversees the temple mount marketed al aqsa mosque thus its identity with the site of solomon s temple is beyond dispute blame goes to yasir arafat for planting the lie about jewish history during the camp david summit in 2000 he reportedly said to president bill clinton that solomon s temple was not in jerusalem but in nablus deep in the west bank in 2010 a senior palestinian authority official put out a report saying that the western wall has never been a part of what is called the jewish temple and a softened version of it has trickled down to purportedly neutral organizations like unesco which in a 2016 resolution on jerusalem referred to the holy site solely as al aqsa mosque al haram al sharif put references to the western wall in scare quotes and called on israel to stop all archaeological excavations for western liberals who like to imagine that this conflict is exclusively about borders this denialism is a wake up call some people i spoke to compared it to the denial of the holocaust mr barkay the archaeologist who survived the budapest ghetto even thinks that temple denial is more serious than holocaust denial perhaps that is because what is at stake is the jewish indigenous claim to the land of israel if someone comes to me and denies the holocaust do i have a question no because i saw the number of my father his number from auschwitz mr be eri told me i want the next generation to be like i was with the number of my father i want them to dig to find when you find a coin and you can read the date you have no question it s not a story i tell you mr seidemann the lawyer believes that the city of david should not be part of sovereign israel in a two state solution david be eri and i will oppose each other and say your dream is my nightmare and my nightmare is your dream he said they are blind to the cruelty of occupation but the finds are another story the reason we can engage is that i see what they see that s my mayflower that s my plymouth rock there is a concept in judaism of jerusalem shel malah and jerusalem shel matah jerusalem of above and jerusalem of below referring to the distinction between the heavenly and earthly cities humanists like me tend to believe that the earthly jerusalem has suffered brutally at the hands of those zealous about the heavenly one it is why i always loved the poem tourists by israel s former poet laureate yehuda amichai which is set by a gate at david s tower in jerusalem you see that man with the baskets just right of his head there s an arch from the roman period just right of his head but he s moving he s moving i said to myself redemption will come only if their guide tells them you see that arch from the roman period it s not important but next to it left and down a bit there sits a man who s bought fruit and vegetables for his family but a week in this place made me think a bit differently about the relationship between the two jerusalems the earthly one divided but the heavenly one at least some of it is not after all one man david is both the king of israel a prophet of the muslims and the progenitor of the line that gave the world jesus every person i spoke to sounded as if they knew him he was a stone thrower a hero a statesman a sinner a poet a warrior a romantic a lying cheating bastard perhaps king david himself is the shared territory a flawed shepherd who once united a nation and is claimed by everyone who wakes and sleeps in zion  dean was born in the bronx in 1978 and was drawn to art from an early age because of the borough s thriving cultural scene in the 1980s where he was fascinated by the graffiti art on subway cars and in apartment hallways he began buying art for the same reason a lot of people do status an image to project to the world this worked better with some people than others i got laughed at for collecting at first by some friends he tells me who couldn t believe he was spending all his money on paintings but it impressed the record executive clive davis a collector himself who went to dean s house and saw that he was different from other musicians and producers with whom he did business what began as a tool to use in renegotiating his music industry contracts soon turned into a compulsion then a passion and by the time he married keys in 2010 a lifestyle over the past 20 years he and his wife have built one of the great american collections of contemporary art and he has quietly become one of the art world s most important power brokers a singular advocate for artists in an industry that often exploits creativity for the sake of the bottom line as he began collecting more seriously he and keys refocused their purchases on living artists especially african american artists people like nina chanel abney arthur jafa and deana lawson who are the primary focus of what he now calls the dean collection and whose careers he learned he could help as a high profile client of various galleries one of his tactics he tells me is walking into a gallery to ask questions about one of their younger artists often an artist of color who maybe hasn t had a show in a while and if the gallery seems unenthusiastic and tries to sell him work by a different artist he keeps pushing for the original artist he came to see who often winds up getting a solo show as a result of his inquiries because he s shown the artist has market value this might seem like a small gesture a collector advocating for an undervalued artist but commercial galleries are above all the front line in an industry obsessed with profit and the importance of this kind of influence which puts the artist above the business from a collector often the greediest of all players in this comedy of manners can t be overstated his goal has been nothing less than to change the climate of the art world to shift the color of the artists on the walls of galleries and museums which for most of history have been reserved for white men because who else is going to do it he says everybody goes into a gallery and sees what they can get for cheap and how to take advantage of an artist i choose to do it the other way in the last few years more and more artists of color have started to receive major exhibitions with increasing regularity this has been a positive development but dean also noticed an alarming trend of stories in the press speculating on black artists as the newest stars of the art market or read another way as a kind of shallow currency that can reinforce the art market s overarching greed i kept seeing write ups saying this is what to buy

as a gunfighter in the american west it helped to have a competitive advantage being fast on the draw was essential and removing a revolver from a stiff leather holster was never as easy as hollywood made it seem but possessing good aim in an age of faulty smoky ammo and inaccurate weaponry helped even more the best shot in the early days of the era was the taciturn james butler hickok who for no good reason earned the sobriquet wild bill he boasted another advantage he was ambidextrous which meant he could fire off a hail of 12 rounds to the six by an ordinary mortal image his supremacy as a shootist is evident early in wild bill tom clavin s new biography of the gunslinger hickok not only survives all of his walk and draw contests he becomes a bona fide celebrity in the process his good looks surely help over six feet tall blue eyed long nosed and mustachioed he is as lithe as a tiger and blessed with wavy auburn hair that he wears shoulder length like a rock star his in town get up

and feel what they are programmed to they are still just machines and their emotions are not real if at all existent so i believe they are still property and we should respect each others property but the robot itself should not have rights yet max scholer hoggard wilmington nc of course it is wrong to vandalize a company s property and people shouldn t do it but there seems to be no deeper meaning to this just people destroying stuff for fun occasionally i will tell my google home to shut up just for the fun of it because i know i would never do that to a real assistant an issue i have is that we are getting too comfortable with our robots i have met young people who tell their alexa and siri please and thank you we can even customize their voices and wake up word with that i feel like there is a good chance that people will begin substituting robots for true human interaction zade hoggard high wilmington nc i didn t think that robot should be treat like human because they are just machine without emotion or feelings i think that if one day we create a robot to smart that could be dangerous so it s really important to differentiate oneself from robots luna paris i think that robots can be dangerous because they do not feel like us as result they could commit something wrong because they do not have feeling like human that can be one result that some people have fear about robot kerren 3a yc clip robots deserve respect violence should not be accepted in any society or really in any situation if we were to allow violence whether it was between humans or humans and robots chaos would reign but as far as treating robots as if they were humans or locking up humans for violence against machines a line does need to be drawn robots do not have souls feelings or emotions outside of the programming they ve been given the programming comes from in fact a human if we were to give robots the same privileges as people humans could use that fact to their advantage and pursue their own agendas through robots ak florida as technology progresses the line between human and machine will be blurred to a point where it is practically unrecognizable robots will become increasingly complex and human esque until they are virtually indistinguishable from people and it at this point that they must be considered equal while this future is an inevitability it is still some time in the future and robots that exist now are a far cry from human however just because they are not people doesn t mean that they deserve the treatment outlined in the article the machines we create are extensions of ourselves and they deserve the respect that any other human creations do jake hession hoggard high school wilmington nc i find it to be highly unnecessary that people are beheading robots or beating them with bats punching them will all their strength and smearing them with barbecue sauce i find it disrespectful well not to the robot because they do not have feelings but i do find it disrespectful to the creator of the robot imagine going to art museum and punching a hole in a painting just because you don t like it is that disrespectful to the painting no the painting does not have feelings but is it disrespectful to the artist yes it is disrespectful to destroy something that someone put so much time and effort into er hoggard highschool wilmington n c
